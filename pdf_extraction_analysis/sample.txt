•  Background and Aims  Coastal plant communities globally are highly vulnerable to future sea-level rise and 
storm  damage,  but  the  extent  to  which  these  habitats  are  affected  by  the  various  environmental  perturbations 
associated with chronic salinization remains unclear. In this study, we examine the relationship between North 
Carolina wetland tree community composition and basal area change and indicators of salinization such as soil 
salt ion content and elevation.
•  Methods  We surveyed 34 forest plots in forested, freshwater wetlands across the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula. 
A subset of our study sites had been sampled during the previous decade as part of the Carolina Vegetation Survey, 
enabling us to investigate the environmental effects on current community structure, and community change over time.
•  Key  Results  Multi-variate  (ordination)  analysis  and  linear  regression  models  of  tree  community  compos-
ition revealed that elevation and soil salt content were correlated with changes in total site tree basal area. Shifts 
in tree community composition were, however, only weakly correlated with indicators of salinization, specifically 
elevation, soil sulphate and sodium, but not chloride. While the majority of plots experienced gains in basal area 
over the past decade, consistent with secondary succession, sites with high soil salt content or low elevation ex-
perienced basal area (biomass) loss during the same period.
•  Conclusions  The key factors associated with chronic saltwater intrusion (soil ion content) likely explain recent 
changes in tree biomass, and potential shifts in community composition in low-elevation sites along the North 
Carolina coast. Not only is it probable that other coastal forest ecosystems worldwide will experience similar 
stressors and shifts in community biomass and structure as sea levels rise, but the ability of these habitats to deliver 
key ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and flood defence will be compromised as a result.

Key words:  Forested  wetlands,  saltwater  intrusion,  sea-level  rise,  tree  communities,  North  Carolina,  Carolina 
Vegetation Survey, salinity.

INTRODUCTION

The south-eastern Coastal Plain of the USA is an important bio-
diversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000; Noss et al., 2015) and a 
region that has undergone significant land-use change over the 
past century (Herbert et al., 2015). By the end of this century 
this region may experience 100 cm of sea-level rise (Vermeer 
and  Rahmstorf,  2009),  resulting  not  only  in  loss  of  wetlands 
along  the  coastal  fringe,  but  also  negative  consequences  for 
forested  ecosystems  further  inland,  such  as  loss  of  biodiver-
sity,  invasion  by  Phragmites  australis  or  conversion  to  open 
water. In advance of large-scale flooding due to sea-level rise, 
saltwater intrusion occurs, defined as the landward movement 
of  seawater  into  areas  that  have  normally  experienced  fresh-
water inputs (Nicholls, 2004). Low topographic relief, artificial 
drainage networks and erosion associated with agricultural land 
use have made this region extremely vulnerable to saltwater in-
trusion  (Bhattachan  et  al.,  2018).  This  process  is  further  ex-
acerbated  by  the  maritime  winds  and  storm  surges  that  drive 
salt inland, processes becoming more intense and frequent due 

to climate change (Vitousek et al., 2017). Thus, saltwater in-
trusion is seen as the leading edge of climate change (Ardón 
et  al.,  2013,  2016).  On  the  Coastal  Plain  of  North  Carolina, 
signs of sea-level rise and salinization are already apparent on 
the landscape (Doyle et al., 2007; Ardón et al., 2013; Herbert 
et al., 2015); in this study we are particularly concerned with 
determining the effects of salinization of the tree communities 
within these wetlands.

The effects of sea-level rise and salinization are by no means 
restricted  to  forests  of  the  Coastal  Plain  of  North  Carolina; 
studies across the south-eastern USA including South Carolina 
(Stroh et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2017), Georgia (Pennings et al., 
2005),  Louisiana  (Shirley  and  Battaglia,  2006)  and  Florida 
(Desantis et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2010) have investigated 
similar  effects  of  saltwater  intrusion  on  plant  communities. 
A 2015 review by Herbert et al. summarizes the literature re-
cords of wetland salinization around the world and its primary 
drivers.  While  sea-level  rise  is  the  primary  driver  of  coastal 
wetland  salinization  in  the  south-eastern  USA,  there  are

multiple mechanisms by which freshwater ecosystems are be-
coming  more  saline.  Irrigation  leading  to  saltwater  intrusion 
through groundwater is a prominent issue in parts of Australia 
(Hart et al., 1990), land subsidence from agriculture results in 
relative sea-level rise in Italy (Antonellini et al., 2008), water 
diversion  reduces  river  flow,  leading  to  saltwater  intrusion  in 
the  Mekong  and Yellow  River  deltas  of  Vietnam  and  China 
(Wassmann et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2009), and road salt accu-
mulation is problematic for wetlands in the north-eastern USA 
(Kaushal et al., 2005). Variation in salinization mechanism, as 
well  as  salt  type  (i.e.  road  salts  versus  marine  salts),  will  af-
fect receiving ecosystems differently, but there is no doubt that 
salinization of freshwater ecosystems is having effects at broad 
scales (Kaushal et al., 2018).

Little is known about the effects of salinization on the for-
est communities of North Carolina’s Coastal Plain beyond the 
estuarine fringe. The effects of salinity and sea level have been 
well  studied  in  saltmarsh  vegetation  (Reed,  1995;  Pennings 
et al., 2005; Silvestri et al., 2005), but prior work has not con-
sidered how salinization is affecting the distribution and diver-
sity of trees within the forests of the Coastal Plain. There is a 
need to study the impacts of sea-level rise on freshwater wet-
land plant communities, particularly tree diversity and biomass, 
as these are important benchmarks of community structure and 
carbon storage.

The  Carolina Vegetation  Survey  has  undertaken  a  compre-
hensive survey of the vegetation composition of the Carolinas 
with survey plots distributed across the two states (Peet et al., 
2018). The vegetation of North Carolina’s Coastal Plain follows 
typical  patterns  of  coastal  fringe  to  upland  progression,  with 
extensive palustrine (freshwater, non-tidal) and pocosin (shrub-
scrub and evergreen) wetlands (Moorhead and Brinson, 1995). 
Data  from  the  Carolina Vegetation  Survey  have  been  used  to 
monitor  changes  in  biodiversity,  in  particular  the  response  to 
acute  disturbances  such  as  hurricanes  and  fires  (Reilly  et  al., 
2005; Xi et al., 2008; Palmquist et al., 2014). Records from the 
Carolina Vegetation Survey allow us to track changes in forest 
community over the past two decades.

The focus of this study is to determine whether the effects of 
salinization are already perceivable in the tree community com-
position and structure of this sentinel ecosystem. In this study, 
we use comprehensive forest survey data of 34 plots to deter-
mine whether current tree composition and basal area are cor-
related with saltwater exposure or saltwater exposure risk. For 
a subset of these sites, we compared present survey data with 
the Carolina Vegetation Survey dataset to examine whether tree 
composition and basal area are changing more rapidly in sites 
with saltwater exposure or exposure risk. We hypothesized that 
the magnitude of community composition change, and the per-
centage change in basal area, would be related to environmental 
indicators of salinization at each site, specifically elevation, soil 
chloride content and other salt ions found in sea water.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area

Sites  for  this  study  are  located  on  the  Albemarle–Pamlico 
Peninsula  in  north-eastern  North  Carolina  (Fig.  1).  The 

Albemarle  and  Pamlico  sounds  form  the  second  largest  estu-
ary complex in North America and the peninsula spans 5000 
km2 just inside the barrier islands of North Carolina. The mean 
annual  temperature  is  16.6  °C  and  mean  annual  precipita-
tion  is  1320  mm,  which  is  evenly  distributed  across  seasons 
(Plymouth  Weather  Station,  Washington  Country,  NC)  (see 
Ardón  et  al.,  2010  for  a  detailed  description  of  the  region). 
This  region  is  also  prone  to  severe  storms  and  hurricanes  in 
late summer and early autumn. More than half of the land area 
is  <1  m  above  sea  level  (Poulter  and  Halpin,  2008).  Soils  of 
the study sites are mainly Pungo muck and Hyde loam, which 
are  deep,  poorly  drained,  high  in  organic  content  and  highly 
acidic (NRCS, 2017). Vegetation communities include brackish 
marshes, mesic mixed hardwood forests, Atlantic white cedar 
forests,  estuarine  pine  woodlands  and  cypress–gum  swamps 
(Schafale, 2012).

Data collection and measurement

Vegetation plots for this study are located in forested stands 
within public lands. Sixteen sites were established and meas-
ured by the Carolina Vegetation Survey between 2003 and 2009 
(Peet et al., 2012). We located the original plots and resurveyed 
the vegetation in June and July of 2016. An additional 18 new 
plots  were  established  for  this  study  (in  2015  or  2016)  for 
a  total  of  34  plots.  New  plots  were  established  on  public  or 
federally  owned  property  and  using  the  same  protocol  as  the 
Carolina Vegetation Survey (Peet et al., 1998). Plot sizes vary 
between 100 and 1000 m2 to capture the diversity of the species 
present in a given homogeneous community (larger plots being 
necessary in more heterogeneous areas). The sites span many 
vegetation  community  types  and  include  wetlands  of  varying 
inundation period. Site elevation was acquired from the USGS 
National Elevation Dataset (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017) and 
soil  type  from  the  National  Resources  Conservation  Service 
(Soil Survey Staff, 2017).

For collection of vegetation data, each site was subdivided 
into modules of 10 × 10 m as described in Peet et al. (1998). 
We measured the diameter at breast height of every tree >5 cm 
in diameter in each module. For each species we calculated the 
total basal area (m2 ha−1).

For analysis of soil characteristics, ten soil cores, to 10 cm 
depth,  were  collected  at  each  site  along  a  diagonal  transect 
within one of the modules. Each core was sectioned into two 
5-cm  deep  sections.  For  each  section,  roots  and  rocks  were 
removed  and  soils  were  passed  through  a  2-mm  sieve,  hom-
ogenized and composited for analysis of soil properties and ion 
concentrations. To characterize the soil properties at each site, 
for each core section we measured pH, bulk density, soil mois-
ture percentage and loss on ignition in a 500 °C oven for 4 h. 
To estimate salt exposure, soils for each plot were analysed for 
major ions that occur in seawater (Cl−, SO4
2−, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ 
and Na+). For characterization of soil cation content we meas-
ured water-extractable base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) 
using a CS12A column on a Dionex ICS 2000 ion chromato-
graph (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The Dionex 
ICS  2000  was  also  used  to  analyse  water-extractable  anions 
2−)  on  an  AS-18  analytical  column.  To  understand 
(Cl−,  SO4
soil  nutrient  content,  ammonium  (NH4
+)  was  measured  using

Data analysis

Data analyses were performed in R 3.3.3 (2017). We calcu-
lated total basal area of each species at each site for both the his-
torical Carolina Vegetation Survey sites and the sites measured 
in this study. To compare tree community composition with en-
vironmental characteristics, we created an ordination plot using 
total basal area data from plots surveyed in 2015 and 2016. The 
metaMDS function in the vegan package (Oksanen, 2017) was 
used to create a two-dimensional non-metric multidimensional 
scaling (NMDS) ordination using species basal area and Bray–
Curtis dissimilarity. A total of 28 species were included in the 
analysis (four species present in the survey plots were elimin-
ated from the analysis because they fell below the rarity cut-off: 
0.5 % of the total basal area). The function envfit was used to 
fit environmental variables to the ordination. This function is 
used  to  assess  the  significance  of  each  variable  in  predicting 
the arrangement of the vegetation communities using permuta-
tion tests. Further analysis of environmental characteristics was 
conducted using the corPlot function from the package psych to 
look for correlation between variables.

To understand how vegetation is changing over time, we cre-
ated  a  second  ordination  that  included  the  data  from  the  his-
torical Carolina Vegetation Survey (also using metaMDS and 

the  same  parameters  specified  for  the  first  NMDS).  Simple 
Euclidean distances were calculated between samples of resur-
veyed sites as a proxy for community composition change over 
time. These distances were normalized by the number of years 
between  resampling,  to  yield  a  rate  for  community  compos-
ition change over time. Community composition change over 
time was then compared with the environmental characteristics 
measured for each site in the 2016 survey using simple linear 
regression.

Finally,  we  used  the  total  basal  area  of  each  plot  from  the 
Carolina Vegetation Survey and from the resurvey sites meas-
ured  in  this  study  to  calculate  a  percentage  change  in  total 
basal area. The percentage change in basal area over time was 
also normalized by the number of years between surveys and 
compared  with  the  environmental  characteristics  using  linear 
regression.

RESULTS

The NMDS ordination of all trees and environmental factors 
demonstrates which drivers are most strongly correlated with 
tree community composition. The NMDS ordination (Fig. 2) 
of species abundance (total basal area) data for the 34 vege-
tation plots surveyed in this study during 2015 and 2016 ar-
ranges each surveyed plot by community dissimilarity (stress 
0.178; non-metric fit R2 = 0.969). In this ordination we fitted 
all of the measured environmental parameters (for soil char-
acteristics, only data from the top section, 0–5 cm depth, were 
used in these analyses; no significant differences were found

Ury et al. — Salt exposure effects on tree communities of coastal North Carolinaall  of  the  marine  salt-associated  ions  in  one  direction,  and 
with elevation approximately orthogonal to salts. The results 
from  fitting  the  environmental  data  to  the  community  com-
position  ordination  suggest  that  these  environmental  factors 
are contributing to the distribution of tree species across this 
region.  Neither  soil  nitrogen  (nitrate  or  ammonium)  nor  or-
ganic carbon appear to be important correlates for community 
composition. See Supplementary Data Tables S1 and S2 and 
Fig. S1 for complete site information, soil characteristics and 
correlations between environmental characteristics.

Data from 16 Carolina Vegetation Survey plots collected in 
2003 and 2009 were used to examine how tree communities are 
changing over time. A second NMDS ordination with data from 
both  sample  points  (stress  0.181;  non-metric  fit  R2  =  0.967) 
visually represents the shift in community composition in or-
dination space over time (Fig. 3). Arrows represent how far and 
in what direction a plot’s tree community has moved since the 
plot was established. The movement of plots over time appears 
stochastic overall, without clear trends emerging in the direc-
tion or magnitude of community shift.

To understand the pattern of overall plot movement we cal-
culated vector length and normalized it by time between resam-
pling events. Most plots experienced a small shift in community 
composition and a few plots changed more dramatically. When 
we compared the magnitude of change in community compos-
ition  over  time  with  environmental  factors  (Fig.  4)  we  found 
that elevation, sulphate (SO4
2−) and sodium (Na+) were signifi-
cantly,  although  weakly,  correlated  with  community  compos-
ition change. In contrast to our hypothesis, chloride (Cl−) did 

259

not appear to be significantly correlated with the magnitude of 
community composition change.

Finally, we assessed total basal area change over time at each 
site. As anticipated in early to mid-successional dominated for-
ests in protected lands, we observed that the majority of plots 
are gaining basal area (12 of 16 sites). The range of percentage 
change in basal area is from −9.6 to 118 % and the median is 
33.8 %. However, several plots have experienced a loss of basal 
area since the first survey (7 or 13 years previously). Our results 
show that 37.5 % of sites have grown <10 % over the course of 
the study. Figure 5 shows the correlations between percentage 
change in basal area and the environmental factors. In contrast 
to our results for community composition change, the change 
in basal area is significantly correlated with the environmental 
factors associated with salinization: sodium, sulphate, chloride 
and elevation are all correlated with change in total basal area 
(R2 = 0.56, 0.52, 0.35 and 0.48, respectively). Other environ-
mental factors measured that were significantly correlated with 
percentage basal area change include soil moisture, Ca2+, Mg2+, 
K+ and NH4

DISCUSSION

Our study presents two major conclusions. First, shifts in com-
munity composition of coastal wetland forests may be correl-
ated with indicators of salinization. Second, in our study plots 
that demonstrate the most severe evidence of salinization, we 
observed a loss of tree basal area. Loss of basal area during the

period of this study is a striking finding given the absence of 
development, deforestation, fire, disease or other major disturb-
ance in our surveyed plots. Furthermore, loss of basal area is an 
important indicator of loss of biomass, which raises concerns 
about the ability of these forests to maintain their functions as 
carbon sinks (Slik et al., 2010).

The literature on the effects of saltwater intrusion on vegeta-
tion generally addresses either very fine-scale responses at the 
level of individual plants or plants species, or at the landscape 
scale. Fine-scale investigations include germination or green-
house experiments with particular species at different salinity 
and inundation levels (propagule bank study by Battaglia and 
Collins 2006; greenhouse studies by White et al., 2014; Hanley 
et al., 2017) and offer insight as to how certain species will re-
spond, but may not reflect the context of natural ecosystems. 
Conversely, studies that treat large-scale processes such as land 
use change (Shirley and Battaglia, 2006) do not always detail 
the pathways of community composition change. Few studies 
have been conducted to look specifically at the effects of salt-
water intrusion on plants at the community level. Our work fo-
cuses on change over intermediate time and spatial scales and 
addresses  how  forest  stands  are  changing  over  decadal  time 

periods. This work is important for understanding patterns of 
change  within  a  landscape  and  identifying  areas  for  further 
research.

In our study region, the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula, much 
of  the  area  is  protected  wild  land  where  one  expects  to  find 
trends of forest growth and succession. This is the case for the 
majority of the sites measured in this study, but the occurrence 
of  areas  that  are  experiencing  basal  area  loss  runs  counter  to 
such expectations. The sites that are growing poorly or losing 
basal area could potentially be the canary in the coal mine for 
the  rest  of  the  region.  Evidence  presented  here  demonstrates 
that indicators of saltwater intrusion such as soil ion content and 
elevation are correlated with the current tree community com-
position of the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula. Furthermore, in-
dicators of salinization are correlated with the decline in basal 
area experienced at sites across the region. These findings are 
important  because  loss  of  tree  biomass  has  implication  for 
global  carbon  budgets  and  biodiversity,  and  moreover  the  re-
gion may be a model against which to compare other coastal 
ecosystems.

The  current  community  assemblage  of  trees  within  our 
study  region  reflects  the  natural  environmental  gradients

present  across  the  landscape  and  the  partitioning  of  species 
according  to  their  individual  environmental  niche  require-
ments  and  environmental  tolerance.  For  example,  Juniperus 
virginiana is one of the most salt-tolerant species and is the 
dominant  species  present  in  the  plot  with  the  highest  soil 
chloride content (Supplementary Data Table S3). We also find 
that J. virginiana is in decline at this site, which indicates the 
possibility that, although J. virginiana is relatively more salt-
tolerant than most tree species, environmental change may be 
pushing conditions past habitability for this and other species 
(Desantis  et  al.,  2007).  Overall,  we  find  that  sites  experien-
cing the most loss are ones with lower overall tree basal area 
to begin with. From this, we infer that these sites were already 
considerably more vulnerable, resulting in reduced product-
ivity. It was in these areas that we observed anecdotally the 
apparent transition from coastal forest to systems dominated 
by shrub-grass (i.e. Myrica, Iva, Spartina, Phragmites). This 
loss of tree-dominated wetlands could have significant impli-
cations for carbon budgets (Kasischke et al., 2013).

Previous work demonstrates that the growth of many tree 
species,  including  Pinus  taeda,  J.  virginiana,  Taxodium 

distichum,  Nyssa  biflora  and  Liquidambar  styraciflua,  is 
impeded by salinity or flooding (Hosner, 1960;  Conner and 
Askew, 1992; Tolliver et al., 1997;  McCarron et al., 1998), 
but the majority of this evidence is obtained from greenhouse 
studies or field germination studies. Several field studies have 
been  conducted  to  examine  tree  survival  following  natural 
saltwater  intrusion  events  (Conner,  1995),  but  few  studies 
have tracked forested plots over time (Williams et al., 1999, 
2003),  and  this  is  the  first  study  of  its  kind  to  look  at  tree 
response  to  indicators  of  saltwater  intrusion  on  the  Coastal 
Plain  of  North  Carolina.  We  assert  that  more  work  of  this 
kind  is  necessary  to  understand  the  community-level  re-
sponse to environmental change.

The challenge of data collection in large, biologically diverse 
forests is one of the reasons there has been very little research 
on  these  communities  compared  with  coastal  salt  marshes. 
Given the short time frame of this study, 7–13 years between 
repeat surveys, it is particularly surprising to see that some sites 
showed  such  large  changes  in  both  composition  and  in  total 
basal  area.  Interestingly,  even  though  many  of  the  sites  were 
mature forests, sites that were losing basal area were generally
