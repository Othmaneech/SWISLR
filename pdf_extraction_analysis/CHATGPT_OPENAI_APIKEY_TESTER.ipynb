      "1.  Coastal wetland ecosystems are expected to migrate landwards in response to ris-\n",
      "ing  seas.  However,  due  to  differences  in  topography  and  coastal  urbanization, \n",
      "estuaries vary in their ability to accommodate migration. Low-lying urban areas \n",
      "can constrain migration and lead to wetland loss (i.e. coastal squeeze), especially \n",
      "where  existing  wetlands  cannot  keep  pace  with  rising  seas  via  vertical  adjust-\n",
      "ments. In many estuaries, there is a pressing need to identify landward migration \n",
      "corridors  and  better  quantify  the  potential  for  landward  migration  and  coastal \n",
      "squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  We quantified and compared the area available for landward migration of tidal \n",
      "saline wetlands and the area where urban development is expected to prevent \n",
      "migration for 39 estuaries along the wetland-rich USA Gulf of Mexico coast. We \n",
      "did so under three sea level rise scenarios (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m by 2100).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Within the region, the potential for wetland migration is highest within certain estu-\n",
      "aries in Louisiana and southern Florida (e.g. Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bays, Mermentau \n",
      "River, Barataria Bay, and the North and South Ten Thousand Islands estuaries).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  The potential for coastal squeeze is highest in estuaries containing major metropoli-\n",
      "tan areas that extend into low-lying lands. The Charlotte Harbor, Tampa Bay, and \n",
      "Crystal-Pithlachascotee estuaries (Florida) have the highest amounts of urban land \n",
      "expected to constrain wetland migration. Urban barriers to migration are also high \n",
      "in the Galveston Bay (Texas) and Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bays (Louisiana) estuaries.\n",

      "5.  Synthesis and applications. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that \n",
      "benefit human health and well-being, including shoreline protection and fish and \n",
      "wildlife  habitat.  As  the  rate  of  sea  level  rise  accelerates  in  response  to  climate \n",
