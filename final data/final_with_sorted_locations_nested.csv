Rapid deforestation of a coastal landscape driven by sea level rise andextreme events,"Ury, Emily A; Yang, Xi; Wright, Justin P; Bernhardt, Emily S","Climate change is driving ecological shifts in coastal regions of theworld, where low topographic relief makes ecosystems particularlyvulnerable to sea level rise, salinization, storm surge, and other effectsof global climate change. The consequences of rising water tables andsalinity can penetrate well inland, and lead to particularly dramaticchanges in freshwater forested wetlands dominated by tree species with lowsalt tolerance. The resulting loss of coastal forests could havesignificant implications to the coastal carbon cycle. We quantified therates of vegetation change including land loss, forest loss and shrublandexpansion in North Carolina's largest coastal wildlife refuge over 35years. Despite its protected status, and in the absence of any activeforest management, 32 % (31,600 hectares) of the refuge area has changedlandcover classification during the study period. A total of 1151 hectaresof land was lost to the sea and ~19,300 hectares of coastal forest habitatwas converted to shrubland or marsh habitat. As much as 11 % of allforested cover in the refuge transitioned to a unique land cover type -'ghost forest' - characterized by standing dead trees and fallen treetrunks. The formation of this 'ghost forest' transition state peakedprominently between 2011 and 2012, following Hurricane Irene and afive-year drought, with 4,500 Â± 990 hectares of ghost forest formingduring that year alone. This is the first attempt to map and quantitycoastal ghost forests using remote sensing. Forest losses were greatest inthe eastern portion of the refuge closest to the Croatan and PamlicoSounds, but also occurred much further inland in low elevation areas andalongside major canals. These unprecedented rates of deforestation andland cover change due to climate change may become the status quo forcoastal regions worldwide, with implications for wetland function,wildlife habitat and global carbon cycling.",2021,,Ecol.

Estuaries of the Northeastern United States: Habitat and Land UseSignatures,"Roman, Charles T; Jaworski, Norbert; Short, Frederick T; Findlay, Stuart; Warren, R Scott","Geographic signatures are physical, chemical, biotic, and human-inducedcharacteristics or processes that help define similar or unique featuresof estuaries along latitudinal or geographic gradients.Geomorphologically, estuaries of the northeastern U.S., from the HudsonRiver estuary and northward along the Gulf of Maine shoreline, are highlydiverse because of a complex bedrock geology and glacial history.Back-barrier estuaries and lagoons occur within the northeast region, butthe domiant type is the drowned-river valley, often with rocky shores.Tidal range and mean depth of northeast estuaries are generally greaterwhen compared to estuaries of the more southern U.S. Atlantic coast andGulf of Mexico. Because of small estuarine drainage basins, low riverineflows, a bedrock substrate, and dense forest cover, sediment loads innortheast estuaries are generally quite low and water clarity is high.Tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, intertidal mudflats, and rocky shoresrepresent major habitat types that fringe northeast estuaries, supportingcommercially-important fauna, forage nekton and benthos, and coastal birdcommunities, while also serving as links between deeper estuarine watersand habitats through detritus-based pathways. Regarding land use and waterquality trends, portions of the northeast have a history of over a centuryof intense urbanization as reflected in increased total nitrogen and totalphosphorus loadings to estuaries, with wastewater treatment facilities andatmospheric deposition being major sources. Agricultural inputs arerelatively minor throughout the northeast, with relative importanceincreasing for coastal plain estuaries. Identifying geographic signaturesprovides an objective means for comparing the structure, function, andprocesses of estuaries along latitudinal gradients.",2000,,,23,,,,,,#6,Roman 2000,,,https://doi.org/nan,U.S.,Mexico,,,

This transgression is acomplex process regulated by infrequent storms that flood uplandecosystems increasing soil salinity. As a result upland vegetation isreplaced by halophyte marsh plants. Here we present a review of the mainprocesses and feedbacks regulating the transition from upland ecosystemsto salt marshes. The goal is to provide a process-based framework thatenables the development of quantitative models for the dynamics of themarsh-upland boundary.

"Salt Marsh Mosquito-Control Ditches: Sedimentation, Landscape Change, andRestoration Implications","Corman, Sarah S; Roman, Charles T; King, John W; Appleby, Peter G","Mosquito ditches are a prolific physical feature of Atlantic coast saltmarshes, dug most intensely since the 1930s to control the breeding ofsalt marsh mosquitoes. Removal of ditches by filling or other methods isunder consideration as a restoration alternative at a Fire Island, NewYork, salt marsh. This study evaluated sediment dynamics and marshlandscape structure of the ditched marsh, thereby providing information tobetter support efforts to predict marsh responses to restorationalternatives. Field surveys, historic and recent aerial photographyanalysis, and radiometric dating techniques were used. The estimatedaverage natural sedimentation rate within the ditches was 0.52 cm y -1 , arate greater than the accretion rate of the adjacent marsh surface. Theaverage time for a Fire Island ditch to naturally fill would be 175 yearsfrom present, but spatially this is highly variable, with some ditchescompletely filled and others showing no evidence of natural filling.Active filling of ditches may be a feasible restoration alternative,pending the findings of pilot studies, but given concerns for marshsubmergence with accelerated rates of sea level rise, restoration designshould provide a hydrologic network to facilitate adequate marsh drainage.\textcopyright 2012 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.",2012,,J.

Uncovering climate (in)justice with an adaptive capacity assessment: Amultiple case study in rural coastal North Carolina,"Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin; Rivers, Louie; Cutts, Bethany","Climate change resilience is an area of praxis where efforts to enhancecommunity adaptive capacity are informed by theory. However, there isgrowing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastalmanagement policies while many communities with climate justice issuesstruggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities,contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planningefforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding socialvulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), andreceive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls tointegrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions ofadaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in arural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climatejustice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal CommunityResilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planningefforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations,and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previousapplications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity.This result highlights that the information sharing goals of theengagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threatperceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealinginstances of adaptation oppression.

Can Saltwater Intrusion Accelerate Nutrient Export from Freshwater WetlandSoils? An Experimental Approach,"Steinmuller, Havalend E; Chambers, Lisa G","\textcopyright Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., MadisonWI 53711 USA. All Rights reserved. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable tosaltwater intrusion, which may alter soil biogeochemical processes, leadto the export of nutrients into the coastal zone, and contribute toeutrophication. Using intact soil cores from three different freshwaterwetlands and subjecting them to control (0), 5, or 15 parts per thousand(ppt) seawater treatments, we investigated how different wetland soils(bayhead swamp, cypress dome, and mineral marsh) and salinities alter theexport of soil nutrients [soluble reactive P (SRP), NH 4 +, and dissolvedorganic C (DOC)], as well as microbial biomass C and greenhouse gasemissions. The highest salinity treatment increased CO 2 production by 30%with no change in methane production. Porewater NH 4 + concentrationsaveraged 8Ã higher than the control in the 15-ppt treatment and 5Ã greaterthan the control in the 5-ppt treatment, with a \ 1-wk lag period betweenporewater accumulation of NH 4 + and export into the surrounding water.The magnitude of NH 4 + export was mediated by wetland soil type. Solublereactive P concentrations averaged 8Ã and 3.5Ã higher in the cypress domeand bayhead swamp 15-ppt treatments respectively than in their controls,though no effect was observed within the mineral marsh. Dissolved organicC concentrations differed by wetland soil type but were unaffected bysalinity treatment. This study demonstrates that saltwater intrusion couldcatalyze the rapid export of nutrients from freshwater wetland soils intothe coastal zone, though nutrient export varies by wetland soil type.",2018,,Soil Sci.

Present and future sea level rise at the intersection of race and povertyin the Carolinas: A geospatial analysis,"Handwerger, Leah R; Sugg, Margaret M; Runkle, Jennifer D","Sea level rise (SLR) has and will continue to impact coastal communitiesin the coming decades. Despite the widespread availability of data on SLRprojections, little is known about the differential impact of SLR onminority or economically disadvantaged populations. In this study, we aimto identify the geographic areas in which low-income and communities ofcolor along the North and South Carolina coastline in the United Stateswill experience the most severe effects of SLR. Geospatial mapping wasperformed to estimate the total area impacted by 1) SLR, 2) tidalinundation, and 3) low-lying areas separately for three scenarios (0-, 2-,and 4-feet). Findings project that over 2.2 million people and at least370,000 Black or economically disadvantaged individuals will be impactedby SLR by 2100. Results showed that the most economically deprived andracially segregated communities are already experiencing the effects ofSLR, including more frequent tidal inundation and low-lying flooding.Inland flooding is seven times more likely to occur in low-income Blackcommunities compared to high-income white communities.

Potential increase in coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level risesuggested by considering hydrodynamic attenuation effects,"RodrÃ­guez, JosÃ© F; Saco, Patricia M; Sandi, Steven; Saintilan, Neil; Riccardi, Gerardo","The future of coastal wetlands and their ecological value depend on theircapacity to adapt to the interacting effects of human impacts andsea-level rise. Even though extensive wetland loss due to submergence is apossible scenario, its magnitude is highly uncertain due to limitedunderstanding of hydrodynamic and bio-geomorphic interactions over time.In particular, the effect of man-made drainage modifications onhydrodynamic attenuation and consequent wetland evolution is poorlyunderstood. Predictions are further complicated by the presence of anumber of vegetation types that change over time and also contribute toflow attenuation. Here, we show that flow attenuation affects wetlandvegetation by modifying its wetting-drying regime and inundation depth,increasing its vulnerability to sea-level rise. Our simulations for anAustralian subtropical wetland predict much faster wetland loss thancommonly used models that do not consider flow attenuation.",2017,,Nat.

Model of Marsh Erosion and Migration,"Kirwan, Matthew L; Walters, David C; Reay, William G; Carr, Joel A","Coastal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, whereecosystem services such as flood protection depend nonlinearly on wetlandsize and are threatened by sea level rise and coastal development. Here,we propose a simple model of marsh migration into adjacent uplands, andcouple it with existing models of seaward edge erosion and vertical soilaccretion to explore how ecosystem connectivity influences marsh size andresponse to sea level rise. We find that marsh loss is nearly inevitablewhere topographic and anthropogenic barriers limit migration. Whereunconstrained by barriers, however, rates of marsh migration are much moresensitive to accelerated sea level rise than rates of edge erosion. Thisbehavior suggests a counterintuitive, natural tendency for marsh expansionwith sea level rise, and emphasizes the disparity between coastal responseto climate change with and without human intervention.",2016,,Geophys.

Influence of artificial channels on the source and extent of saline waterintrusion in the wind tide dominated wetlands of the southern Albemarleestuarine system (USA),"Manda, Alex K; Giuliano, Angela S; Allen, Thomas R","Saline water intrusion is degrading water quality in the channelizedcoastal wetlands of the southern Albemarle estuarine system (AES). Thesource, transport and fate of the saline water in the southern AES wasdetermined by monitoring specific conductivity and water levels in smallartificial channels, the Alligator River, the AlligatorâPungo Canal andthe groundwater system for ~12 months. Results indicate that water levelsare affected by wind tides which trigger the movement of saline water intothe interior of the wetlands via the small canals. The wind tides aremostly driven by episodic southerly winds pushing saline water into thecanal network and the groundwater regime proximal to the Alligator River.The saline waters persist in the canals as long as the wind tide eventslast. Specific conductivities from canals and groundwater are shown to beunexpectedly higher closer to the source of the Alligator River thantoward the Albemarle Sound, suggesting that the large AlligatorâPungoCanal facilitates the northward migration of saline water from the PamlicoSound to the Alligator River. Overwash and reversals in the flowdirections between groundwater and surface water bodies suggest thatsaline water that is present during wind tide events may migrate into thegroundwater system from surface water bodies. The results of this studyreveal that whereas the large AlligatorâPungo Canal channels saline waterto the AES, small artificial channels may also play significant roles indegrading water quality in the interior of channelized coastal wetlands.",2014,,Environ.

Differential effects of chronic and acute simulated seawater intrusion ontidal freshwater marsh carbon cycling,"Herbert, Ellen R; Schubauer-Berigan, Joseph; Craft, Christopher B","Tidal freshwater ecosystems experience acute seawater intrusion associatedwith periodic droughts, but are expected to become chronically salinizedas sea level rises. Here we report the results from an experimentalmanipulation in a tidal freshwater Zizaniopsis miliacea marsh on theAltamaha River, GA where diluted seawater was added to replicate marshplots on either a press (constant) or pulse (2 months per year) basis. Wemeasured changes in porewater chemistry (SO4 2-, Cl-, organic C, inorganicnitrogen and phosphorus), ecosystem CO2 and CH4 exchange, and microbialextracellular enzyme activity. We found that press (chronic) seawateradditions increased porewater chloride and sulfate almost immediately, andammonium and phosphate after 2-4 months. Chronic increases in salinityalso decreased net ecosystem exchange, resulting in reduced CO2 and CH4emissions from press plots. Our pulse treatment, designed to mimic naturalsalinity incursion in the Altamaha River (September and October),temporarily increased porewater ammonium concentrations but had fewlasting effects on porewater chemistry or ecosystem carbon balance. Ourfindings suggest that long-term, chronic saltwater intrusion will lead toreduced C fixation and the potential for increased nutrient (N, P) exportwhile acute pulses of saltwater will have temporary effects.",2018,,Biogeochemistry,138,2,137-154,,10.1007/s10533-018-0436-z,,#42,Herbert 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0436-z,,,,,

Watershed land use and river engineering drive wetland formation and lossin the Mississippi river birdfoot delta,"Tweel, Andrew W; Eugene Turner, R","The Mississippi River basin was developed for agriculture at anunprecedented scale and intensity within the last 200 yr. These changesfavored erosion and sediment transport, which were subsequently reduced bysoil conservation practices, the trapping of sediment behind largereservoirs, and channel engineering. We discuss the relationship betweensediment loading and the growth, loss, and stability of wetlands in theMississippi River birdfoot delta (MRBD). We report an anthropogenicallydriven increase in mean suspended sediment concentrations in theMississippi River below New Orleans, from a modeled 350 mg L21 (174 3 109kg yr21) at the end of the 18th century to a measured maximum of 675 mgL21 (3483109 kg yr21) in the late 19th century, followed by a sharpreduction, and then a period of stabilization at 157 mg L21 (91 3 109 kgyr21) after 1962. Changes in wetland area of the MRBD over the past twocenturies reflect variations in sediment supply during periods ofincreasing, decreasing, and stable sediment loading, and are distinct fromwetland loss patterns in other areas of coastal Louisiana. The rapidgrowth of the MRBDuntil the 1930s, which has been used as a reference forone of the world's largest wetland restoration efforts, may not be asuitable archetype for the majority of the coast.

Soils in transition: saltwater intrusion alters soil chemistry inagricultural fields,"Tully, Katherine L; Weissman, Danielle; Wyner, W Jesse; Miller, Jarrod; Jordan, Thomas","As global sea-levels rise, low-lying coastal lands are subject to shallowcoastal flooding and saltwater intrusion, affecting the productivity offarmlands worldwide. Soil biogeochemistry can be dramatically altered assaltwater intrudes agricultural fields. We selected three farm fields inSomerset Co., Maryland affected by saltwater intrusion and establishedtransects from the ditch bank to the center of the cropped field andcollected soils (to ~ 140 cm) at five points along this transect. Thethree fields in this study have different soil types, are located alongdifferent tributaries in the county, and receive different fertilizerrates, yet they all showed similar biogeochemical responses to saltwaterintrusion. We found an increase in electrical conductivity andconcentrations of chloride, sulfate, and forms of phosphorus (P) from thecenter of the field (low) to the ditch banks (high). As inundationincreased, the structure of iron (Fe) changed from crystalline tonon-crystalline forms, possibly due to dissolution under saturatedconditions. Near the edges of the fields, the formation of organometalliccomplexes was positively associated with increases in soil carbon andorganic soil P concentrations. Compared to areas of the fields where cropswere actively growing, soil P concentrations are 2â3 higher on fieldedges, suggesting that saltwater intrusion may be transporting P to theedges of agricultural fields. These field edges are frequently saturated,thus reduction of Fe could lead to P release into solution potentiallyharming water quality. As climate change pushes saltwater further inland,it is important to understand the biogeochemical consequences forecosystems up- and downstream.

Mitigating the Expansion of Harmful Algal Blooms Across theFreshwater-to-Marine Continuum,"Paerl, Hans W; Otten, Timothy G; Kudela, Raphael","Anthropogenic nutrient overenrichment, coupled with rising temperatures,and an increasing frequency of extreme hydrologic events (storms anddroughts) are accelerating eutrophication and promoting the expansion ofharmful algal blooms (HABs) across the freshwater-to-marine continuum. AllHABsâwith a focus here on cyanobacterial bloomsâpose serious consequencesfor water supplies, fisheries, recreational uses, tourism, and propertyvalues. As nutrient loads grow in watersheds, they begin to compound theeffects of legacy stores. This has led to a paradigm shift in ourunderstanding of how nutrients control eutrophication and blooms.Phosphorus (P) reductions have been traditionally prescribed exclusivelyfor freshwater systems, while nitrogen (N) reductions were mainly stressedfor brackish and coastal waters.

The Effects of Dredging on Tidal Range and Saltwater Intrusion in thePearl River Estuary,"Zhu, Jianrong; Yuan, Rui","Yuan, R. and Zhu, J., 2015. The effects of dredging on tidal range andsaltwater intrusion in the Pearl River estuary. A dredging project in thePearl River estuary would influence the topography, water dynamics, andmass transport process. The effects of dredging in the channel of thePearl River estuary on tidal range and saltwater intrusion were studiedusing a hydrodynamic model (finite volume coastal ocean model) andhistorical water depth data. The measured data showed that the tidal rangedecreased and saltwater intrusion increased in the North River. The tidalrange increased and saltwater intrusion decreased in the West River inrecent decades from the 1980s. The simulations in this study showed thatafter dredging (1) the upstream flow split ratio in the river changed(i.e. more freshwater flowed through the Sanshui station), whereas lessfreshwater flowed through the Makou station; (2) the tidal range increasedin the West River network and decreased in the downstream reaches of theNorth River network; and (3) the saltwater intrusion increased in the WestRiver mouths and weakened in the North River mouths. These results agreedwith the observed phenomenon. The change in the flow split ratio betweenthe North River and the West River induced by dredging was the fundamentaldynamic that caused changes in both the tidal range and saltwaterintrusion in the Pearl River estuary.

Despite growing recognition that different bacterial species arepresent or active at different salinities, the mechanisms by whichsalinity structures community composition remain unclear. We tested thehypothesis that these patterns reflect ecological coherence in thesalinity preferences of phylogenetic groups using a reciprocal transplantexperiment of fresh- and saltwater wetland soils. The salinity of both theorigin and host environments affected community composition (16S rRNA genesequences) and activity (CO2 and CH4 production, and extracellular enzymeactivity). These changes in community composition and activity rates werestrongly correlated, which suggests the effect of environment on functioncould be mediated, at least in part, by microbial community composition.Based on their distribution across treatments, each phylotype wascategorized as having a salinity preference (freshwater, saltwater, ornone) and phylogenetic analyses revealed a significant influence ofevolutionary history on these groupings. This finding was corroborated byexamining the salinity preferences of high-level taxonomic groups. Forinstance, we found that the majority of Î±- and Î³-proteobacteria in thesewetland soils preferred saltwater, while many Î²-proteobacteria preferfreshwater. Overall, our results indicate the effect of salinity onbacterial community composition results from phylogenetically-clusteredsalinity preferences.",2015,,Front.

Multiple States in the Sea-Level Induced Transition from TerrestrialForest to Estuary,"Brinson, Mark M; Christian, Robert R; Blum, Linda K","[In this paper we provide a conceptual model to examine changes inecosystem state during the transition from terrestrial forest to shallowestuarine environments for coastal mainland marshes at the Virginia CoastReserve (VCR), United States of America. Ecosystem states arecharacterized by plant community dominants and soil/sedimentcharacteristics. The five states considered are upland or wetland forest,organic high marsh, intertidal mineral low marsh, autotrophic benthic withor without submersed aquatic vascular plants, and heterotrophic benthic(estuarine bottom). Transitions between states are described from theperspective of a fixed forest location undergoing transition from oneecosystem state to another. Rising sea level is acknowledged as the mastervariable that forces the process of change overall. Each state ishypothesized to have self-maintaining properties and thus is resistant tochange from rising sea level; alternatively, transitions between statesare facilitated by disturbance or exposure to acute stress. For change tooccur, resistance must be overcome by events that are more abrupt thanrising sea level and that appear as accentuated pulsings, which result inanother self-maintaining and resistant state. Such events facilitate plantspecies replacement and alter sediment conditions. Mechanisms responsiblefor causing a state to cross a threshold are unique for each transitiontype and include brackish-water intrusion (osmotic stress and sulfidetoxicity), tidal creek encroachment (redistribution of sediments), erosivecurrents and waves (resuspension of sediments, which increases lightextinction), and increasing water depth (leads to greater bottom shading).Field experiments relevant to scales at which pulsings occur are notabundant in coastal marshes.]",1995,,Estuaries,18,4,648-659,,10.2307/1352383,,#76,Brinson 1995,,,https://doi.org/10.2307/1352383,United States of America,,,,
Indigenous People and Environmental Justice: The Impact of Climate Change,"Tsosie, Rebecca","The international dialogue on climate change is currently focused on astrategy of adaptation that includes the projected removal of entirecommunities, if necessary. Not surprisingly, many of the geographicalregions that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change are alsothe traditional lands of indigenous communities. This article takes theposition that the adaptation strategy will prove genocidal for many groupsof indigenous people, and instead argues for recognition of an indigenousright to environmental self-determination, which would allow indigenouspeoples to maintain their cultural and political status upon theirtraditional lands. In the context of climate change policy, such a rightwould impose affirmative requirements on nation-states to engage in amitigation strategy in order to avoid catastrophic harm to indigenouspeoples. This article argues for a new conception of rights to address theunique harms of climate change. An indigenous right to environmentalself-determination would be based on human rights norms in recognitionthat ""sovereignty claims"" by indigenous groups are not a sufficient basisto protect traditional ways of life and the rich and unique cultural normsof such groups. Similarly, tort-based theories of compensation for theharms of climate change have only limited capacity to address the concernsof indigenous peoples.",2007,,Univ. Colo.

A multiple knowledge approach for adaptation to environmental change:lessons learned from coastal Louisiana's tribal communities,"Maldonado, Julie Koppel","\textlessp\textgreaterEnvironmental changes, such as sea level rise, areforcibly displacing communities around the world. Forced displacement,inadequate governance mechanisms to address relocation and economic-basedadaptation and restoration efforts are leading to devastating social,cultural, health, and economic consequences for the people and communitiesaffected. This article focuses on three tribal communities in coastalLouisiana that are experiencing rapid environmental change and risk ofdisplacement due to historical discriminatory processes, oil anddam-related development projects, oil disasters, increased exposure tohurricanes, and relative sea level rise. Focusing on the political ecologyof the communities' experiences of environmental change, including theimpacts of displacement and decisions to stay in-place vs. relocate, thispaper addresses broader issues of adaptive governance structures andpolicy implications. Building on Bronen's (2011) rights-based approach toadaptation and Shearer's (2012) approach to a political ecology ofadaptation, I argue that governance structures should be put in place thatsupport communities' in-situ adaptation efforts or, if the communitydecides its current location is no longer inhabitable, to assistcommunity-led relocation efforts. Multiple forms of knowledge should beincorporated into and should inform the structures supporting theadaptation process. I highlight the social, political, environmental andeconomic context within which environmental changes are occurring incoastal Louisiana through discussion on the loss of the commons, thecreation of an energy sacrifice zone, costbenefit based restorationefforts and forced displacement and relocation.Key words: Environmentalchange, displacement, relocation, adaptation\textless/p\textgreater",2014,,J.

The effects of saltwater pulses on belowgroundprocessing rates of detrital organic matter as mediated by microbialactivities are uncertain. Our objectives were to quantify whether and howpulses of saltwater (i) change soil porewater physicochemistry, (ii)change soil microbial extracellular enzyme activities, and (iii) changeroot litter breakdown over time in freshwater and brackish marshes. From2014 to 2016, we simulated saltwater intrusion as monthly in situ pulsedadditions of artificial seawater in experimental dosing chambers (1.4 mdiameter) within freshwater and brackish marshes of Everglades NationalPark. At monthly intervals, we collected soil porewater chemistry, andmeasured microbial extracellular enzymes, elemental stoichiometric ratios,and breakdown rates (k) of incubated (0â30 cm depth) root litter andcompared these responses over time. Saltwater pulses increased sulfate andnitrogen concentrations in porewater at the freshwater site. However,saltwater pulses generally decreased porewater constituents (e.g.,dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus species) atthe brackish site. One saltwater pulse increased root litter k by1.25-fold in the brackish marsh. However, long-term (740 days) k inbrackish wetlands, and both short- and long-term k in freshwater wetlands,were not affected by 24 monthly pulses of saltwater.

Contemporary Deposition and Long-Term Accumulation of Sediment andNutrients by Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands Impacted by Sea Level Rise,"Noe, Gregory B; Hupp, Cliff R; Bernhardt, Christopher E; Krauss, Ken W","\textcopyright 2016, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (outsidethe USA). Contemporary deposition (artificial marker horizon, 3.5 years)and long-term accumulation rates (210Pb profiles, \ 150 years) of sedimentand associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measuredin wetlands along the tidal Savannah and Waccamaw rivers in thesoutheastern USA. Four sites along each river spanned anupstream-to-downstream salinification gradient, from upriver tidalfreshwater forested wetland (TFFW), through moderately and highlysalt-impacted forested wetlands, to oligohaline marsh downriver.Contemporary deposition rates (sediment, C, N, and P) were greatest inoligohaline marsh and lowest in TFFW along both rivers. Greater rates ofdeposition in oligohaline and salt-stressed forested wetlands wereassociated with a shift to greater clay and metal content that is likelyassociated with a change from low availability of watershed-derivedsediment to TFFW and to greater availability of a coastal sediment sourceto oligohaline wetlands. Long-term accumulation rates along the WaccamawRiver had the opposite spatial pattern compared to contemporarydeposition, with greater rates in TFFW that declined to oligohaline marsh.Long-term sediment and elemental mass accumulation rates also were 3â9Ãlower than contemporary deposition rates. In comparison to other studies,sediment and associated nutrient accumulation in TFFW are lower thandownriver/estuarine freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marshes, suggestinga reduced capacity for surface sedimentation (short-term) as well asshallow soil processes (long-term sedimentation) to offset sea level risein TFFW.

"Assessing impacts of climate change, sea level rise, and drainage canalson saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifer","Rasmussen, P; Sonnenborg, T O; Goncear, G; Hinsby, K","Groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is vulnerable to climatechange and sea level rise because both may potentially impact saltwaterintrusion and hence groundwater quality depending on the hydrogeologicalsetting. In the present study the impacts of sea level rise and changes ingroundwater recharge are quantified for an island located in the WesternBaltic Sea. The low-lying central area of the investigated part of theisland was extensively drained and reclaimed during the second half of the19th century by a system of artificial drainage canals that significantlyaffects the flow dynamics of the area. The drinking water, mainly forsummer cottages, is abstracted from 11 wells drilled to a depth of around20 m into the upper 5-10 m of a confined chalk aquifer, and the totalpumping is only 5-6 % of the drainage pumping. Increasing chlorideconcentrations have been observed in several abstraction wells and in somecases the WHO drinking water standard has been exceeded. Using themodeling package MODFLOW/MT3D/SEAWAT the historical, present and futurefreshwater-sea water distribution is simulated. The model is calibratedagainst hydraulic head observations and validated against geochemical andgeophysical data from new investigation wells, including borehole logs,and from an airborne transient electromagnetic survey. The impact ofclimate changes on saltwater intrusion is found to be sensitive to theboundary conditions of the investigated system. For the flux-controlledaquifer to the west of the drained area only changes in groundwaterrecharge impacts the freshwater-sea water interface whereas sea level risedoes not result in increasing sea water intrusion. However, on the barrierislands to the east of the reclaimed area, below which the sea ishydraulically connected to the drainage canals, and the boundary of theflow system therefore controlled, the projected changes in sea level,groundwater recharge and stage of the drainage canals all have significantimpacts on saltwater intrusion and the chloride concentrations found inabstraction wells.",2013,,Hydrol.

Declines in plant productivity drive loss of soil elevation in a tidalfreshwater marsh exposed to saltwater intrusion,"Solohin, Elena; Widney, Sarah E; Craft, Christopher B","We experimentally increased salinities in a tidal freshwater marsh on theAltamaha River (Georgia, USA) by exposing the organic rich soils to 3.5 yrof continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments with dilute seawaterto simulate the effects of climate change such as sea level rise (press)and drought (pulse). We quantified changes in root production anddecomposition, soil elevation, and soil C stocks in replicated (n = 6) 2.5Ã 2.5 m field plots. Elevated salinity had no effect on rootdecomposition, but it caused a significant reduction in root productionand belowground biomass that is needed to build and maintain soilelevation capital. The lack of carbon inputs from root production resultedin reduced belowground biomass of 1631 Â± 308 vs. 2964 Â± 204 g/m2 incontrol plots and an overall 2.8 Â± 0.9 cm decline in soil surfaceelevation in the press plots in the first 3.5 yr, whereas the control (nobrackish water additions) and the fresh (river water only) treatmentsgained 1.2 Â± 0.4 and 1.7 Â± 0.3 cm, respectively, in a 3.5-yr period. Therewas no change in elevation of pulse plots after 3.5 yr. Based onmeasurements of bulk density and soil C, the decline of 2.8 cm of surfaceelevation resulted in a loss of 0.77 Â± 0.5 kg C/m2 in press plots. Incontrast, the control and the fresh treatment plots gained 0.25 Â± 0.04 and0.36 Â± 0.03 kg C/m2, respectively, which represents a net change in Cstorage of more than 1 kg C/m2. We conclude that, when continuouslyexposed to saltwater intrusion, the tidal freshwater marsh's net primaryproductivity, especially root production, and not decomposition, are themain drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation.

Future coastal population growth and exposure to sea-level rise andcoastal flooding--a global assessment,"Neumann, Barbara; Vafeidis, Athanasios T; Zimmermann, Juliane; Nicholls, Robert J","Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards includingsea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are moredensely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates ofpopulation growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continueinto the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affectedby such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060.Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assessfuture population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends inexposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level andsocio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth ofcoastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends ofurbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but doesnot explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due tofactors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates ofthe baseline population with demographic data in order to derivescenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Ourscenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevationcoastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India,Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest totalcoastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking isexpected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa isexpected to experience the highest rates of population growth andurbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharancountries in Western and Eastern Africa.

Nonlinear Dynamics and Alternative Stable States in Shallow CoastalSystems,"McGlathery, Karen; Reidenbach, Matthew; D'Odorico, Paolo; Fagherazzi, Sergio; Pace, Michael; Porter, John","The dynamics of shallow-water coastal environments are controlled byexternal drivers-sea level rise, storms, and sediment and nutrientsupplies-and by internal feedbacks. Interactions of biotic processes(vegetation growth, trophic dynamics) and abiotic drivers can lead tononlinear responses to changing conditions and to the emergence ofthresholds, hysteresis, and alternative stable states. We develop aconceptual framework for studying interactions between the dynamics ofmarshes and habitats in shallow coastal bays with unconsolidated sediments(seagrass, oyster reefs). Using examples primarily from the Virginia CoastReserve Long Term Ecological Research site, we show that in the subtidalpart of the landscape, two alternative stable states can exist-onedominated by seagrass up to a certain depth that represents a tippingpoint to the second, unvegetated stable state. The depth limit of theseagrass stable state is influenced by (1) the positive feedback ofvegetation on reducing sediment suspension and improving the lightenvironment for growth, (2) climate (e.g., temperature), and (3) waterquality. Two stable states are also present in intertidal areas, with saltmarshes lying above mean sea level and tidal flats below mean sea level.State transitions are driven by sediment availability, sea level rise, therelative strength of wind waves with respect to tidal currents, and thebiotic feedback of vegetation on sediment stabilization and accretion.State-change dynamics in one system may propagate to adjacent systems, andthis coupling may influence the landscape-scale response to environmentalchange. Seagrass meadows and oyster reefs affect adjacent marshes bothpositively (wave attenuation) and negatively (reduced sediment supply),and marsh-edge erosion could negatively influence the light environmentfor seagrass growth. Forecasting the resilience of coastal ecosystems andthe landscape-scale response to environmental change in the next centuryrequires an understanding of nonlinear dynamics, including the possibilityof multiple stable states, the coupled evolution of adjacent systems, andpotential early warning signs of thresholds of change. \textcopyright 2013by The Oceanography Society.

"Saltwater intrusion affects nitrogen, phosphorus and iron transformationsunder oxic and anoxic conditions: an incubation experiment","Weissman, Danielle; Ouyang, Tianyin; Tully, Katherine L","Low-lying coastal ecosystems are rapidly salinizing due to sea level riseand associated saltwater intrusion (SWI).

The main objective of this study was toquantify the amount of nitrateâN (NO3âN), ammoniumâN (NH4âN), solublereactive P (SRP), and total dissolved iron (TDFe) released fromagricultural soils undergoing SWI to determine their potential loss todownstream waterways. Agricultural soils were incubated for 0, 15, and 30days (under oxic and anoxic conditions) with various salt solutioncombinations of sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), calciumsulfate (CaSO4), and Instant OceanÂ® to mimic (1) different ionicconstituents of saltwater at different ionic strengths and (2) thepresence or absence of gypsum, a soil amendment, through the addition ofCaSO4. We also included a set of incubations treated with deionized wateras a no ionic strength control (0.00 M). To increase statistical power, wegrouped individual salt treatments based on our initial hypotheses at theend of the incubation period (day 30) to determine the effects of high(0.26â0.28 M) and low (0.03â0.04 M) ionic strength on inorganic N releaseand combinations of Ca and SO42â additions on SRP release to microcosmsoil solution. Calcium additions decreased SRP release relative tosaltwater that contained only NaCl additions under oxic and anoxicconditions. Additionally, high ionic strength treatments, which were about7 times the ionic strength of low ionic strength treatments, released twotimes as much NH4âN to the soil solution, which suggests a non-linearrelationship between ionic strength and NH4âN release. At day 30, anoxicmicrocosm soils treated with Instant OceanÂ® to simulate 15 parts perthousand seawater (ionic strength 0.26 M) released significantly moreNH4âN (by 782 times), SRP (by 6 times), and TDFe (by 197 times) to thesoil solution than oxic microcosm soils (P < 0.05). This treatment wasdesigned to reflect a field inundated by brackish seawater for almost amonth, which is representative of conditions on farm fields undergoingSWI. Under these anoxic conditions, as much as 22% of bioavailable soil P(as SRP) and 45% of total inorganic N (as NH4âN) could be released tooverlying water when inundated with saltwater.

By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer tovulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogetheroverlook racial inequalityâor worse dismiss its systemic causes andexplain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities tonon-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must beattuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality.

Iron clad wetlands: Soil iron-sulfur buffering determines coastal wetlandresponse to salt water incursion,"Schoepfer, V A; Bernhardt, E S; Burgin, A J","Â©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Coastal freshwaterwetland chemistry is rapidly changing due to increased frequency of saltwater incursion, a consequence of global change. Seasonal salt waterincursion introduces sulfate, which microbially reduces to sulfide.Sulfide binds with reduced iron, producing iron sulfide (FeS),recognizable in wetland soils by its characteristic black color. Theobjective of this study is to document iron and sulfate reduction rates,as well as product formation (acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromiumreducible sulfide (CRS)) in a coastal freshwater wetland undergoingseasonal salt water incursion. Understanding iron and sulfur cycling, aswell as their reduction products, allows us to calculate the degree ofsulfidization (DOS), from which we can estimate how long soil iron willbuffer against chemical effects of sea level rise. We show that soilchloride, a direct indicator of the degree of incursion, best predictediron and sulfate reduction rates. Correlations between soil chloride andiron or sulfur reduction rates were strongest in the surface layer (0-3cm), indicative of surface water incursion, rather than groundwaterintrusion at our site. The interaction between soil moisture andextractable chloride was significantly related to increased AVS, whereasincreased soil chloride was a stronger predictor of CRS. The current DOSin this coastal plains wetland is very low, resulting from high soil ironcontent and relatively small degree of salt water incursion. However, withtime and continuous salt water exposure, iron will bind with incomingsulfur, creating FeS complexes, and DOS will increase.",2014,,Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences,119,12,,,10.1002/2014JG002739,,#100,Schoepfer 2014,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JG002739,,,,,

Though baldcypress are known to tolerate moderate floodingand salinity, their growth has been shown to decrease when they experiencedrought and high salinity. This study examined the effects of drought andelevated salinity on the growth of baldcypress seedlings and saplings. Ina restored wetland in North Carolina, we examined the growth of 8-year-oldbaldcypress by measuring height and diameter at breast height (DBH) alongsalinity, nutrient, and flooding gradients. In a greenhouse, we placed1-year-old baldcypress seedlings in either drought or saturated conditionsand applied different water treatments: fresh water, sulfate, andartificial salt water (5 ppt [parts per thousand]). Over 26 weeks, wemeasured diameter at root collar, height, and biomass. In the field,chloride concentrations in soil solution had a negative effect on DBH andheight (51 and 36% decrease, respectively); high water levels had anegative effect on height (47% decrease) and DBH (46% decrease). In thegreenhouse, both drought and salinity decreased diameter growth (43 and61% decline, respectively) and height (64 and 43% decline, respectively).Sulfate did not have a significant effect on diameter growth, but caused a14% decrease in height.

Speciesthat nested on ocean beaches (Diamondback Terrapins, shorebirds, andterns) were also ranked highly, but their use of other foraging habitatsreduced their overall exposure. Future studies on potential effects of SLRon vertebrates in southeastern coastal ecosystems should focus on therelative importance of different habitat types to these species' foragingand nesting requirements. Our straightforward prioritization approach isapplicable to other coastal systems and can provide insight to managers onwhich species to focus resources, what components of their habitats needto be protected, and which locations in the study area will providehabitat refuges in the face of SLR.",2015,,Environ.

Understanding Vulnerability of Coastal Communities to Climate ChangeRelated Risks,"Dolan, A H; Walker, I J","[This paper discusses the concept of vulnerability as characterized in theclimate change literature and presents a framework for assessing adaptivecapacity. The framework recognizes inherent susceptibilities ofhuman-environment systems exposed to climate variability and change. Asclimate change impacts are unevenly distributed among and within nations,regions, communities and individuals due to differential exposures andvulnerabilities, the framework highlights determinants of adaptivecapacity at the local scale and situates them within larger regional,national and international settings. Determinants include: access anddistribution of resources, technology, information and wealth; riskperceptions; social capital and community structure; and institutionalframeworks that address climate change hazards. This broader approachcontrasts typical impact assessments that focus largely on reducingeconomic detriments of change. The framework provides a methodologicalstarting point that, as a community-based or 'bottom-up' approach, yieldsimportant insight on local responses to climate change. It also recognizesthat short-term exposure to variability is an important source ofvulnerability superimposed on long-term change. At the community level,perceptions and experiences with climate extremes can identify inherentcharacteristics that enable or constrain a community to respond, recoverand adapt. As such, local and traditional knowledge is key to climatechange research and should be incorporated into research design andimplementation. This approach provides locally relevant outcomes thatcould promote more effective decision-making, planning and management inremote areas susceptible to climate change hazards. As part of a largerstudy, this approach will be refined with local input to study sea-levelrise impacts on one of Canada's most sensitive coastlines, northeastGraham Island, Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia.Preliminary evidence of changes and responses in this area are identifiedas a brief case study.]",2006,,J.

Freshwater salinization syndrome on a continental scale,"Kaushal, Sujay S; Likens, Gene E; Pace, Michael L; Utz, Ryan M; Haq, Shahan; Gorman, Julia; Grese, Melissa","Salt pollution and human-accelerated weathering are shifting the chemicalcomposition of major ions in fresh water and increasing salinization andalkalinization across North America. We propose a concept, the freshwatersalinization syndrome, which links salinization and alkalinizationprocesses. This syndrome manifests as concurrent trends in specificconductance, pH, alkalinity, and base cations. Although individual trendscan vary in strength, changes in salinization and alkalinization haveaffected 37% and 90%, respectively, of the drainage area of the contiguousUnited States over the past century. Across 232 United States GeologicalSurvey (USGS) monitoring sites, 66% of stream and river sites showed astatistical increase in pH, which often began decades before acid rainregulations. The syndrome is most prominent in the densely populatedeastern and midwestern United States, where salinity and alkalinity haveincreased most rapidly. The syndrome is caused by salt pollution (e.g.,road deicers, irrigation runoff, sewage, potash), accelerated weatheringand soil cation exchange, mining and resource extraction, and the presenceof easily weathered minerals used in agriculture (lime) and urbanization(concrete). Increasing salts with strong bases and carbonates elevate acidneutralizing capacity and pH, and increasing sodium from salt pollutioneventually displaces base cations on soil exchange sites, which furtherincreases pH and alkalinization. Symptoms of the syndrome can include:infrastructure corrosion, contaminant mobilization, and variations incoastal ocean acidification caused by increasingly alkaline river inputs.Unless regulated and managed, the freshwater salinization syndrome canhave significant impacts on ecosystem services such as safe drinkingwater, contaminant retention, and biodiversity.",2018,,Proc.

Relative sea-level rise and the conterminous United States: Consequencesof potential land inundation in terms of population at risk and GDP loss,"Haer, Toon; Kalnay, Eugenia; Kearney, Michael; Moll, Henk","Global sea-level rise poses a significant threat not only for coastalcommunities as development continues but also for national economies. Thispaper presents estimates of how future changes in relative sea-level riseputs coastal populations at risk, as well as affect overall GDP in theconterminous United States. We use four different sea-level rise scenariosfor 2010â2100: a low-end scenario (Extended Linear Trend) a second low-endscenario based on a strong mitigative global warming pathway (GlobalWarming Coupling 2.6), a high-end scenario based on rising radiativeforcing (Global Warming Coupling 8.5) and a plausible very high-endscenario, including accelerated ice cap melting (Global Warming Coupling8.5+). Relative sea-level rise trends for each US state are employed toobtain more reasonable rates for these areas, as long-term rates varyconsiderably between the US Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts because ofthe Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, local subsidence and sedimentcompaction, and other vertical land movement. Using these trends for thefour scenarios reveals that the relative sea levels predicted by century'send could range â averaged over all states â from 0.2 to 2.0m abovepresent levels. The estimates for the amount of land inundated vary from26,000 to 76,000km2. Upwards of 1.8 to 7.4 million people could be atrisk, and GDP could potentially decline by USD 70â289 billion.Unfortunately, there are many uncertainties associated with the impactestimates due to the limitations of the input data, especially the inputelevation data.

Rural coastal community resilience: Assessing a framework in eastern NorthCarolina,"Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin","Rural coastal communities have unique vulnerabilities to the impactscaused by sea level rise and saltwater intrusion compared to coastal urbanareas that have growing populations, increasing property values, andextensive infrastructure. In contrast, rural coastal communities aretypically dependent on traditional natural resource livelihoods likefarming, commercial fishing, forestry, and outdoor recreationopportunities. Saltwater intrusion, exacerbated by sea level rise, impactsrural livelihoods by limiting suitable agricultural land and developmentoptions, which compounds local economic difficulties. Higher rates ofpoverty, aging demographics, and out-migration already challenge theresilience of rural coastal communities. Informed by sociological researchthat addresses the local economic factors unique to rural communities andresilience research on coastal communities and natural hazards, we proposethe Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework.

Applying the RCCRframework revealed that local priorities include maintaining rurallivelihoods, creating job opportunities, and addressing highly vulnerablepopulations.

"Coastal flooding, climate change and environmental justice: Identifyingobstacles and incentives for adaptation in two metropolitan BostonMassachusetts communities","Douglas, Ellen M; Kirshen, Paul H; Paolisso, Michael; Watson, Chris; Wiggin, Jack; Enrici, Ashley; Ruth, Matthias","We explored the possible future impacts of increased coastal flooding dueto sea level rise and the potential adaptation responses of two urban,environmental justice communities in the metropolitan Boston area ofMassachusetts. East Boston is predominantly a residential area with someindustrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastalfringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversifiedindustrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similarsocioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent towhich residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In EastBoston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett,it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable.Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we foundthat the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective orknowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge.Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes withintheir communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was anintense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more andbecome actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation.The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images arepowerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existingcultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to theplanning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of theprocess can create important educational opportunities and develop trustand consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.",2012,,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,,,,,10.1007/s11027-011-9340-8,,#137,Douglas 2012,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-011-9340-8,Boston,,,,

Coastal Wetland Distributions: Delineating Domains of Macroscale Driversand Local Feedbacks,"Braswell, Anna E; Heffernan, James B","How do multiple stable states influence local and macroscale ecologicalpatterns? Understanding how local feedbacks operate within heterogeneouscoastal environments is essential to forecasting marsh persistence andloss in response to sea level rise, river impoundment, and otherenvironmental changes. In coastal lagoons, feedbacks between open water,wind erosion, and stabilizing effects from wetland vegetation produce twostates: open water with fringing marshes, and marsh-dominated basins.Unknown is whether, how, and at what scales these feedbacks affectdistribution of marsh ecosystems in large, complex estuaries, wheremacroscale coastal and watershed characteristics control suspendedsediment and wind energy. Using a multi-scale geospatial analysis spanningthe Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA, we show that characteristics ofestuaries (depth, shoreline complexity, land use, tidal range, latitude)and their watersheds (discharge) best predict wetland extent at broadspatial scales (~> 102 km2). Bimodal distribution of wetland extent occursat finer scales (~ 100 to 102 km2) that correspond to the theoreticalscale of wave erosion feedbacks. Local feedbacks are thus the mechanismthat controls marsh dynamics, whereas coastal and watershedcharacteristics determine macroscale wetland distributions through theireffects on these processes. In coastal marshes, and likely in othercomplex landscapes, the spatial extent of feedbacks shapes the scales atwhich local and macroscale processes control the distribution ofalternative stable states. These findings help predict scales at whichcoastal wetlands will respond catastrophically or continuously toenvironmental change, and provide a basis for multi-scale strategies toprotect and restore coastal wetland ecosystems.",2019,,Ecosystems,,,,,10.1007/s10021-018-0332-3,,#146,Braswell 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-018-0332-3,USA,,,,
A global perspective on wetland salinization: ecological consequences of agrowing threat to freshwater wetlands,"Herbert, Ellen R; Boon, Paul; Burgin, Amy J; Neubauer, Scott C; Franklin, Rima B; ArdÃ³n, Marcelo; Hopfensperger, Kristine N; Lamers, Leon P M; Gell, Peter","Salinization, a widespread threat to the structure and ecologicalfunctioning of inland and coastal wetlands, is currently occurring at anunprecedented rate and geographic scale. The causes of salinization arediverse and include alterations to freshwater flows, land-clearance,irrigation, disposal of wastewater effluent, sea level rise, storm surges,and applications of de-icing salts. Climate change and anthropogenicmodifications to the hydrologic cycle are expected to further increase theextent and severity of wetland salinization. Salinization alters thefundamental physicochemical nature of the soil-water environment,increasing ionic concentrations and altering chemical equilibria andmineral solubility. Increased concentrations of solutes, especiallysulfate, alter the biogeochemical cycling of major elements includingcarbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, and silica. The effects ofsalinization on wetland biogeochemistry typically include decreasedinorganic nitrogen removal (with implications for water quality andclimate regulation), decreased carbon storage (with implications forclimate regulation and wetland accretion), and increased generation oftoxic sulfides (with implications for nutrient cycling and thehealth/functioning of wetland biota). Indeed, increased salt and sulfideconcentrations induce physiological stress in wetland biota and ultimatelycan result in large shifts in wetland communities and their associatedecosystem functions. The productivity and composition of freshwaterspecies assemblages will be highly altered, and there is a high potentialfor the disruption of existing interspecific interactions. Although thereis a wealth of information on how salinization impacts individualecosystem components, relatively few studies have addressed the complexand often non-linear feedbacks that determine ecosystem-scale responses orconsidered how wetland salinization will affect landscape-level processes.Although the salinization of wetlands may be unavoidable in many cases,these systems may also prove to be a fertile testing ground for broaderecological theories including (but not limited to): investigations intoalternative stable states and tipping points, trophic cascades,disturbance-recovery processes, and the role of historical events andlandscape context in driving community response to disturbance.",2015,,Ecosphere,6,10,art206,,10.1890/ES14-00534.1,,#147,Herbert 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00534.1,,,,,
Tidal wetland stability in the face of human impacts and sea-level rise,"Kirwan, Matthew L; Megonigal, J Patrick","Coastal populations and wetlands have been intertwined for centuries,whereby humans both influence and depend on the extensive ecosystemservices that wetlands provide. Although coastal wetlands have long beenconsidered vulnerable to sea-level rise, recent work has identifiedfascinating feedbacks between plant growth and geomorphology that allowwetlands to actively resist the deleterious effects of sea-level rise.Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate,nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether wetlandscontinue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human impactsinteract with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors thatinfluence transgression into adjacent uplands.",2013,,Nature,504,7478,53-60,,10.1038/nature12856,,#151,Kirwan 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12856,,,,,

We quantified soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)mineralization using seasonal in situ incubations of modified resin coresalong spatial gradients of chronic salinification (from continuouslyfreshwater tidal forest to salt impacted tidal forest to oligohalinemarsh) and in hummocks and hollows of the continuously freshwater tidalforest along the blackwater Waccamaw River and alluvial Savannah River.Salinification increased rates of net N and P mineralization fluxes andturnover in tidal freshwater forested wetland soils, most likely throughtree stress and senescence (for N) and conversion to oligohaline marsh(for P). Stimulation of N and P mineralization by chronic salinificationwas apparently unrelated to inputs of sulfate (for N and P) or directeffects of increased soil conductivity (for N). In addition, the tidalwetland soils of the alluvial river mineralized more P relative to N thanthe blackwater river. Finally, hummocks had much greater nitrificationfluxes than hollows at the continuously freshwater tidal forested wetlandsites.

Little is known, however, about howspatial variation in these factors exactly relates to human settlementsand activities, and how this has developed over time. Such knowledge isimportant for identifying vulnerable regions that are at risk fromphenomena such as food shortages and water stress. Human activities are akey driving force in global change, and thus detailed information onpopulation distribution is an important input to any research framework onglobal change. In this paper we assess the global geospatial patterns ofthe distribution of human population and related factors, with regard tothe altitude above sea level and proximity to the coast. The investigatedfactors are physical conditions, urbanisation, agricultural practices,economy, and environmental stress. An important novel element in thisstudy, is that we included the temporal evolution in various factorsrelated to human settlements and agricultural practices over the 20thcentury, and used projections for some of these factors up to the year2050. We found population pressure in the proximity of the coast to besomewhat greater than was found in other studies. Yet, the distribution ofpopulation, urbanisation and wealth are evolving to become more evenlyspread across the globe than they were in the past. Therefore, thecommonly believed tendency of accumulation of people and wealth alongcoasts is not supported by our results. At the same time, food productionis becoming increasingly decoupled from the trends in population density.Croplands are spreading from highly populated coastal zones towards inlandzones.

Effective sea-level rise and deltas: Causes of change and human dimensionimplications,"Ericson, Jason P; VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty, Charles J; Dingman, S Lawrence; Ward, Larry G; Meybeck, Michel","An assessment is made of contemporary effective sea-level rise (ESLR) fora sample of 40 deltas distributed worldwide. For any delta, ESLR is a netrate, defined by the combination of eustatic sea-level rise, the naturalgross rate of fluvial sediment deposition and subsidence, and acceleratedsubsidence due to groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction. ESLR isestimated under present conditions using a digital data set of deltaboundaries and a simple model of delta dynamics. The deltas in this studyrepresent all major climate zones, levels of population density, anddegrees of economic development. Collectively, the sampled deltas serve asthe endpoint for river basins draining 30% of the Earth's landmass, and42% of global terrestrial runoff. Nearly 300 million people inhabit thesedeltas. For the contemporary baseline, ESLR estimates range from 0.5 to12.5 mm yr - 1 . Decreased accretion of fluvial sediment resulting fromupstream siltation of artificial impoundments and consumptive losses ofrunoff from irrigation are the primary determinants of ESLR in nearly 70%of the deltas. Approximately 20% of the deltas show acceleratedsubsidence, while only 12% show eustatic sea-level rise as the predominanteffect. Extrapolating contemporary rates of ESLR through 2050 reveals that8.7 million people and 28,000 km 2 of deltaic area in the sample set ofdeltas could suffer from enhanced inundation and increased coastalerosion. The population and area inundated rise significantly whenconsidering increased flood risk due to storm surge. This study finds thatdirect anthropogenic effects determine ESLR in the majority of deltasstudied, with a relatively less important role for eustatic sea-levelrise. Serious challenges to human occupancy of deltaic regions worldwideare thus conveyed by factors which to date have been studied lesscomprehensively than the climate change-sea-level rise question.\textcopyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"The effects of varying salinity on ammonium exchange in estuarinesediments of the Parker River, Massachusetts","Weston, Nathaniel B; Giblin, Anne E; Banta, Gary T; Hopkinson, Charles S; Tucker, Jane","We examined the effects of seasonal salinity changes on sediment ammonium(NH(4) (+)) adsorption and exchange across the sediment-water interface inthe Parker River Estuary, by means of seasonal field sampling, laboratoryadsorption experiments, and modeling. The fraction of dissolved NH(4) (+)relative to adsorbed NH(4) (+) in oligohaline sediments rose significantlywith increased pore water salinity over the season. Laboratory experimentsdemonstrated that small (similar to 3) increases in salinity fromfreshwater conditions had the greatest effect on NH(4) (+) adsorption byreducing the exchangeable pool from 69% to 14% of the total NH(4) (+) inthe upper estuary sediments that experience large (0-20) seasonal salinityshifts. NH(4) (+) dynamics did not appear to be significantly affected bysalinity in sediments of the lower estuary where salinities under 10 werenot measured. We further assessed the importance of salinity-mediateddesorption by constructing a simple mechanistic numerical model for porewater chloride and NH(4) (+) diffusion for sediments of the upper estuary.The model predicted pore water salinity and NH(4) (+) profiles that fitmeasured profiles very well and described a seasonal pattern of NH(4) (+)flux from the sediment that was significantly affected by salinity. Themodel demonstrated that changes in salinity on several timescales(tidally, seasonally, and annually) can significantly alter the magnitudeand timing of NH(4) (+) release from the sediments.

Until now, quantitative, global time series of spatial andtemporal dynamics of inundation have been unavailable. This study presentsthe first global estimate of monthly inundated areas for 1993â2000. Thedata set is derived from a multisatellite method employing passivemicrowave land surface emissivities calculated from SSM/I and ISCCPobservations, ERS scatterometer responses, and AVHRR visible andnear-infrared reflectances.

A survey-based assessment of perceived flood risk in urban areas of theUnited States,"Harlan, Sharon L; Sarango, Mariana J; Mack, Elizabeth A; Stephens, Timothy A","How people perceive the risks of climatic hazards is currently a majorresearch thrust in the field of risk perception. In the wake of recentflood disasters in the United States (US) and globally, more researchersare investigating social vulnerabilities as well as the role of cognitionin explaining risk perceptions. This study analyzed how people in the USperceive the risk (i.e., likelihood and seriousness) of flooding via alayered analysis that considered several plausible and intertwined linesof inquiry from the risk perception literature. We surveyed 9250individuals within nine major urban areas, including the largest city andone smaller city in each region. The National Flood Hazard Layer productprovided data for deriving their potential exposure to flood hazards. Theanalyses tested and confirmed several hypotheses drawn from SocialVulnerability Theory and from Protective Motivation Theory:characteristics associated with social vulnerability (older, female,race/ethnic minorities, low income), previous experiences with andawareness of flood news, and potential exposure to flood hazard (localfraction of flood prone area) significantly increased risk perceptions offloods. Self-confidence in ability to cope with a future flood disasterlowered risk perceptions. This study is the first snapshot of flood riskperceptions nationwide in the US.

Vertical land motion as a key to understanding sea level change andvariability,"WÃ¶ppelmann, Guy; Marcos, Marta","Abstract Vertical land motions are a key element in understanding how sealevels have changed over the past century and how future sea levels mayimpact coastal areas. Ideally, to be useful in long-term sea levelstudies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errorsthat are 1 order of magnitude lower than the contemporary climate signalsof 1 to 3?mm/yr observed on average in sea level records, either usingtide gauges or satellites. This metrological requirement constitutes achallenge in geodesy. Here we review the most successful instrumentalmethods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at theEarth's surface, so that the objectives of understanding and anticipatingsea levels can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy. In thisrespect, the required level of uncertainty is examined in two case studies(global and local). A special focus is given to the use of the GlobalPositioning System (GPS) and to the combination of satellite radaraltimetry with tide gauge data. We update previous data analyses andassess the quality of global satellite altimetry products available to theusers for coastal applications. Despite recent advances, a near-plateaulevel of accuracy has been reached. The major limitation is therealization of the terrestrial reference frame, whose physical parameters,the origin and the scale factor, are beyond the scope of a uniquetechnique such as the GPS. Additional practical but nonetheless importantissues are associated with the installation of GPS antennas, such asensuring that there is no unknown differential vertical motion with thetide gauge.",2016,,Rev.

Exploring the impacts of flood insurance reform on vulnerable communities,"Nance, Earthea","This paper identifies geographic areas whose real estate markets werepotentially impacted by US flood insurance reform, and it exploresconcurrent vulnerabilitiesâby income and raceâin the most impacted areas.Because of the geographic and demographic significance of the Gulf Coastin terms of flood risk, flood insurance, and vulnerability, theHouston-Galveston region was selected for analysis. Flood insurance reformunder the BiggertâWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 occurredunabated over a 21-month period from July 2012 to March 2014. This periodrepresents a unique real-world intervention that can be analyzed using aquasi-experimental design. The period was characterized by numerousanecdotal reports of spiking flood insurance rates and market uncertainty.Market data were gathered for two years before and two years afterBiggertâWaters in Harris and Galveston Counties. Paired z-tests wereperformed to examine before and after market differences. Findings showed17 zip codes that experienced significant impacts (p\textless0.01 in 14zip codes, p\textless0.05 in 3 zip codes). Among the significantlyimpacted zip codes, low-income households were overrepresented by 11% inHarris County and by 32% in Galveston County; and minorities wereoverrepresented by 43% in Galveston. These results support the hypothesisthat flood insurance reform can have disproportionate impacts.

Direct and indirect controls on organic matter decomposition in fourcoastal wetland communities along a landscape salinity gradient,"Stagg, Camille L; Baustian, Melissa M; Perry, Carey L; Carruthers, Tim J B; Hall, Courtney T","Coastal wetlands store more carbon than most ecosystems globally. As sealevel rises, changes in flooding and salinity will potentially impactecological functions, such as organic matter decomposition, that influencecarbon storage. However, little is known about the mechanisms that controlorganic matter loss in coastal wetlands at the landscape scale. As sealevel rises, how will the shift from fresh to salt-tolerant plantcommunities impact organic matter decomposition? Do long-term,plant-mediated, effects of sea-level rise differ from direct effects ofelevated salinity and flooding? We identified internal and externalfactors that regulated indirect and direct pathways of sea-level riseimpacts, respectively, along a landscape-scale salinity gradient thatincorporated changes in wetland type (fresh, oligohaline, mesohaline andpolyhaline marshes). We found that indirect and direct impacts ofsea-level rise had opposing effects on organic matter decomposition.Salinity had an indirect effect on litter decomposition that was mediatedthrough litter quality. Despite significant variation in environmentalconditions along the landscape gradient, the best predictors of above- andbelow-ground litter decomposition were internal drivers, initial litternitrogen content and initial litter lignin content respectively. Litterdecay constants were greatest in the oligohaline marsh and declined withincreasing salinity, and the fraction of litter remaining (asymptote) wasgreatest in the mesohaline marsh. In contrast, direct effects of salinityand flooding were positive. External drivers, salinity and flooding,stimulated cellulytic activity, which was highest in the polyhaline marsh.Synthesis. Our results indicate that as sea level rises, initial directeffects of salinity will stimulate decay of labile carbon, but over timeas plant communities shift from fresh to polyhaline marsh, litter decaywill decline, yielding greater potential for long-term carbon storage.These findings highlight the importance of quantifying carbon loss atmultiple temporal scales, not only in coastal wetlands but also in otherecosystems where plant-mediated responses to climate change will havesignificant impacts on carbon cycling.",2018,,J.

Saltwater and nutrient legacies reduce net ecosystem carbon storagedespite freshwater restoration: insights from experimental wetlands,"Lee, Dong Yoon; Kominoski, John S; Kline, Michael; Robinson, Michelle; Roebling, Suzy","Net ecosystem carbon balance is a comprehensive assessment of ecosystemfunction that can test restoration effectiveness.

It is uncertain how wetland carbon stocks and fluxeschange during freshwater restoration following exposure to saltwater andelevated nutrients. We restored freshwater to sawgrass (Cladiumjamaicense) peat monoliths from freshwater marshes of the Everglades(Florida, U.S.A.) that had previously been exposed to elevated salinity(approximately9 ppt) and phosphorus (P) loading (1 g P m?2 year?1) inwetland mesocosms.

Potential biochemical indicators of salinity tolerance in plants,"Ashraf, M; Harris, P J C","Despite a wealth of published research on salinity tolerance of plants,neither the metabolic sites at which salt stress damages plants nor theadaptive mechanisms utilized by plants to survive under saline conditionsare well understood. As a result, there are no well-defined indicators forsalinity tolerance available to assist plant breeders in the improvementof salinity tolerance of important agricultural crops. Although plantbreeders have successfully improved salinity tolerance of some crops inrecent decades, using plant vigor or seed yield as the main selectioncriteria, selection may be more convenient and practicable if the croppossesses distinctive indicators of salt tolerance at the whole plant,tissue or cellular level. Thus, there is a need to determine theunderlying biochemical mechanisms of salinity tolerance so as to provideplant breeders with appropriate indicators. In this review, thepossibility of using these biochemical characteristics as selectioncriteria for salt tolerance is discussed. It is concluded that althoughthere are a number of promising selection criteria, the complex physiologyof salt tolerance and the variation between species make it difficult toidentify single criteria. Progress is more likely if biochemicalindicators for individual species rather than generic indicators can bedetermined. \textcopyright 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As opposed tonostalgia--the melancholia or homesickness experienced by individuals whenseparated from a loved home--solastalgia is the distress that is producedby environmental change impacting on people while they are directlyconnected to their home environment. The paper will focus on two contextswhere collaborative research teams have found solastalgia to be evident:the experiences of persistent drought in rural NSW and the impact oflarge-scale open-cut coal mining on individuals in the Upper Hunter Valleyof NSW. In both cases, people exposed to environmental change experiencednegative affect that is exacerbated by a sense of powerlessness or lack ofcontrol over the unfolding change process. METHODS: Qualitative(interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (community-based surveys)research has been conducted on the lived experience of drought and mining,and the findings relevant to solastalgia are presented. RESULTS: Theauthors are exploring the potential uses and applications of the conceptof solastalgia for understanding the psychological impact of theincreasing incidence of environmental change worldwide.

Although recent research has investigated thedrivers and rates of coastal forest decline, the associated changes incarbon storage across large extents have not been quantified. We mappedghost forest spread across coastal North Carolina, USA, using repeat LightDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys, multi-temporal satellite imagery,and field measurements of aboveground biomass to quantify changes inaboveground carbon. Between 2001 and 2014, 15% (167 km2) of unmanagedpublic land in the region changed from coastal forest to transition-ghostforest characterized by salt-tolerant shrubs and herbaceous plants.Salinity and proximity to the estuarine shoreline were significant driversof these changes. This conversion resulted in a net aboveground carbondecline of 0.13 Â± 0.01 TgC. Because saltwater intrusion precedesinundation and influences vegetation condition in advance of mature treemortality, we suggest that aboveground carbon declines can be used todetect the leading edge of sea level rise. Aboveground carbon declinesalong the shoreline were offset by inland aboveground carbon gainsassociated with natural succession and forestry activities like planting(2.46 Â± 0.25 TgC net aboveground carbon across study area). Our studyhighlights the combined effects of saltwater intrusion and land use onaboveground carbon dynamics of temperate coastal forests in North America.By quantifying the effects of multiple interacting disturbances, ourmeasurement and mapping methods should be applicable to other coastallandscapes experiencing saltwater intrusion.

Global-scale projections suggest that between20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios,respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, whichwill in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valuedecosystem services1-3. These projections do not necessarily take intoaccount all essential geomorphological4-7 and socio-economic systemfeedbacks8. Here we present an integrated global modelling approach thatconsiders both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically bysediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical andlateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonizedby wetland vegetation. We use this approach to assess global-scale changesin coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise andanthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century. On thebasis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses,wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, ifmore than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space)of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sedimentsupply remains at present levels. In contrast to previous studies1-3, weproject that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area willrange between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation spacein addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilienceof global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability ofaccommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building ofanthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructureis expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being aninevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicatethat large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, ifsufficient additional accommodation space can be created through carefulnature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management.",2018,,Nature,561,7722,231-234,,10.1038/s41586-018-0476-5,,#228,Schuerch 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0476-5,,,,,

Saltwater Intrusion Modifies Microbial Community Structure and DecreasesDenitrification in Tidal Freshwater Marshes,"Neubauer, Scott C; Piehler, Michael F; Smyth, Ashley R; Franklin, Rima B","Environmental changes can alter the interactions between biotic andabiotic ecosystem components in tidal wetlands and therefore impactimportant ecosystem functions. The objective of this study was todetermine how saltwater intrusion affects wetland nutrientbiogeochemistry, with a specific focus on the soil microbial communitiesand physicochemical parameters that control nitrate removal. Our work tookplace in a tidal freshwater marsh in South Carolina, USA, where a 3.5-yearsaltwater intrusion experiment increased porewater salinities fromfreshwater to oligohaline levels. We measured rates of denitrification,soil oxygen demand, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)and used molecular genetic techniques to assess the abundance andcommunity structure of soil microbes. In soils exposed to elevatedsalinities, rates of denitrification were reduced by about 70% due tochanges in the soil physicochemical environment (higher salinity, highercarbon:nitrogen ratio) and shifts in the community composition ofdenitrifiers. Saltwater intrusion also affected the microbial communityresponsible for DNRA, increasing the abundance of genes associated withthis process and shifting microbial community composition. Though rates ofDNRA were below detection, the microbial community response may be aprecursor to increased rates of DNRA with continued saltwater intrusion.Overall, saltwater intrusion reduces the ability of tidal freshwatermarshes to convert reactive nitrogen to dinitrogen gas and thereforenegatively affects their water quality functions.

Bothrocks exhibited a logarithmic loss of sorption efficiency in mixturescontaining more than approximately 3 mM Clâ concentration (100 mg Clâ/L;about <1% saltwater). We infer that aquifer solids immersed in freshwaterwould undergo phosphorus desorption in response to the introduction ofthis minor amount of seawater. This Clâ concentration is within the rangedesignated as fresh water. Thus we conclude that increased solublereactive phosphorus availability from saltwater-induced desorption mayoccur at the ion exchange front, which is actually landward of thesaltwater intrusion front as it is commonly defined. Sorption efficiencyin our experiments continued to decline as salinity increased, until Clâconcentration reached a second threshold of 50 or 200 mM (1700 or 7700 mgClâ/L), depending on the rock composition, particularly iron content.Further increase in salinity would produce little increase in groundwatersoluble reactive phosphorus concentration.

Identifying Sources and Oxidation of Methane in Standing Dead Trees inFreshwater Forested Wetlands,"Martinez, Melinda; ArdÃ³n, Marcelo; Carmichael, Mary Jane","Wetlands are large sources of methane (CH4), therefore it is vital tounderstand the pathways, mechanisms, and sources to anticipate futurepositive feedbacks to climate change. Plant mediated transport of CH4 fromsediment-borne gases is thought to be a major contributor in wetlandecosystems, though few studies have measured standing dead trees (snags).Snags are expected to become more common across the southeastern coast asmarshes migrate into freshwater forested wetlands. In this study, our goalwas to distinguish the main sources of CH4 being emitted from snags, thatis, from soil or in situ origin. The Î´2H and Î´13C stable isotopiccomposition from various sources was sampled for source determination. Wemeasured CH4 in various components: emissions from snag stem sides and thesoil-atmosphere interface; and concentrations from snag trunk airspace atvarious heights from ground level (30, 60, and 120 cm), and soilporewater. Potential CH4 production and oxidation in tree cores from twoheights (60 and 120 cm) was also measured to examine the potential for CH4generation or oxidation in stems. We found that CH4 concentrations insidesnags (â¼10â200 ppm) were 2â50 times higher than atmospheric levels, andgenerally decreased with increasing stem height. The stable isotopes Î´13Cand Î´2H showed an enrichment from porewater to soils and snag stems. Î´13Cenrichment of CH4 in snag stems suggests that CH4 is being oxidized as itmoves through snags. The tree core vial incubations showed that very fewcores produced small amounts of CH4 under anaerobic conditions (n = 5 outof 50), and very few cores oxidized CH4 under more aerobic conditions (n =5 out of 50). It is possible that a small amount of CH4 is producedin-situ within the heartwood, but it is likely this depends on thedensity, porosity, and aeration of snags (degree of decay). Our resultshighlight that high concentrations of CH4 can persist within the heartwoodof snags long after initial decay, and that CH4 emitted from snags islargely derived from deep wetland soils and oxidized during transport (viadiffusion) throughout the stem of snags.",2022,,Front.

Applications of network analysis for adaptive management of artificialdrainage systems in landscapes vulnerable to sea level rise,"Poulter, Benjamin; Goodall, Jonathan L; Halpin, Patrick N","Summary The vulnerability of coastal landscapes to sea level rise iscompounded by the existence of extensive artificial drainage networksinitially built to lower water tables for agriculture, forestry, and humansettlements. These drainage networks are found in landscapes with littletopographic relief where channel flow is characterized by bi-directionalmovement across multiple time-scales and related to precipitation, wind,and tidal patterns. The current configuration of many artificial drainagenetworks exacerbates impacts associated with sea level rise such assalt-intrusion and increased flooding. This suggests that in theshort-term, drainage networks might be managed to mitigate sea level riserelated impacts. The challenge, however, is that hydrologic processes inregions where channel flow direction is weakly related to slope andtopography require extensive parameterization for numerical models whichis limited where network size is on the order of a hundred or morekilometers in total length. Here we present an application of graphtheoretic algorithms to efficiently investigate network propertiesrelevant to the management of a large artificial drainage system incoastal North Carolina, USA. We created a digital network modelrepresenting the observation network topology and four types of drainagefeatures (canal, collector and field ditches, and streams). We appliedbetweenness-centrality concepts (using Dijkstraâs shortest path algorithm)to determine major hydrologic flowpaths based off of hydraulic resistance.Following this, we identified sub-networks that could be managedindependently using a community structure and modularity approach. Lastly,a betweenness-centrality algorithm was applied to identify major shorelineentry points to the network that disproportionately control water movementin and out of the network. We demonstrate that graph theory can be appliedto solving management and monitoring problems associated with sea levelrise for poorly understood drainage networks in advance of numericalmethods.",2008,,J.

Salinity effects on greenhouse gas emissions from wetland soils arecontingent upon hydrologic setting: a microcosm experiment,"ArdÃ³n, Marcelo; Helton, Ashley M; Bernhardt, Emily S","Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services such ascarbon sequestration, nutrient retention, and flood protection, but theyare also important sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Humanappropriation of surface water and extensive ditching and draining ofcoastal plain landscapes are interacting with rising sea levels toincrease the frequency and magnitude of saltwater incursion into formerlyfreshwater coastal wetlands. Both hydrologic change and saltwaterincursion are expected to alter carbon and nutrient cycling in coastalforested wetlands. We performed a full factorial experiment in which weexposed intact soil cores from a coastal forested wetland to experimentalmarine salt treatments and two hydrologic treatments. We measured theresulting treatment effects on the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over 112 days. Salinity effectswere compared across four treatments to isolate the effects of increasesin ionic strength from the impact of adding a terminal electron acceptor(SO42â). We compared control treatments (DI addition), to artificialsaltwater (ASW, target salinity of 5 parts per thousand) and to twotreatments that added sulfate alone (SO42â, at the concentration found in5 ppt saltwater) and saltwater with the sulfate removed (ASW-SO42â, withthe 5 ppt target salinity maintained by adding additional NaCl). We foundthat all salt treatments suppressed CO2 production, in both drought andflooded treatments. Contrary to our expectations, CH4 fluxes from ourflooded cores increased between 300 and 1200% relative to controls in theASW and ASW-SO42â treatments respectively. In the drought treatments, wesaw virtually no CH4 release from any core, while artificial seawater withsulfate increased N2O fluxes by 160% above DI control. In contrast, saltand sulfate decreased N2O fluxes by 72% in our flooded treatments.

The impact of sea-level rise on saltwater intrusion for barrier-island aquifers in North Carolina,"Fiori, N.; Anderson Jr, W.P.","Saltwater intrusion is an increasing problem for coastal aquifers due to rising sea levels, especially in areas of low hydraulic gradient, such as barrier-island aquifer systems. Large-scale studies are particularly useful for identifying trends in the effects of sea-level rise, especially for relatively understudied barrier-island aquifers. The barrier islands of coastal North Carolina, U.S.A., lie in a hot spot of sea level rise, where rates are projected to exceed global means throughout this century. Herein, we present a study of the effects of sea-level rise using four primary study sites, each with varying hydraulic properties, island width, and rates of sea-level rise. We use these sites to understand the viability of barrier-island aquifers in North Carolina, but also to understand in general the factors that are most important to the future viability of all barrier-island aquifers. We utilize a one-dimensional steady-state analytical model that allows the calculation of the position of the toe of the saltwater wedge at the base of the aquifer while limiting a rise in the water table. We determine the position of the toe for various sea-level projections up to the year 2100 and utilize this parameter as an assessment of the viability of the aquifer. Our findings suggest that higher island width and lower hydraulic conductivity are the most sensitive parameters and help to limit the effects of sea-level rise on aquifer viability. Aquifer risk maps calculated for the entire North Carolina coast, which equate risk with the position of the toe relative to island width, demonstrate that sea-level rise is projected to have increasing impact on aquifer viability over time, but that areas with narrower width and higher sea-level rise rates are the most vulnerable.

"Groundwater pumping causes salinization of coastal streams due to baseflow depletion: Analytical framework and application to Savannah River, GA","Peters, C.N.; Kimsal, C.; Frederiks, R.S.; Paldor, A.; McQuiggan, R.; Michael, H.A.","Groundwater-surface water interactions and associated water management issues are complicated by the risk of salinization along coastlines. Groundwater pumping can be a driving factor of streamflow depletion and allow for increased stream saltwater intrusion. In this study, we develop an analytical framework combining two analytical approaches to calculate the length of saltwater intrusion at high slack water and the stream depletion rate due to groundwater pumping. We test this framework using data from the Savannah River in southeastern U.S and use it to explore saltwater intrusion in the surface water system. The analytical approach produces an accurate estimate of the position of the salt front at approximately 56 km inland. Current pumping rates decrease streamflow by less than 1%, resulting in an increase in the saltwater intrusion length of 100 m. Increased groundwater pumping scenarios, however, show a risk of extending the saltwater intrusion length up to 4 km inland. In these cases, effects from pumping-induced saltwater intrusion would equal or exceed the impacts of sea-level rise or geomorphic change. Salinity is a critical factor in the ecological balance of this estuarine ecosystem and this analytical approach allows for investigation of hypothetical groundwater development in the region. We show, for the first time, the direct link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinity that should be an important management consideration all along developed coastlines.

Year-around survey and manipulation experiments reveal differential sensitivities of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities to saltwater intrusion in Florida Everglades wetlands,"Zhao, J.; Chakrabarti, S.; Chambers, R.; Weisenhorn, P.; Travieso, R.; Stumpf, S.; Standen, E.; Briceno, H.; Troxler, T.; Gaiser, E.; Kominoski, J.; Dhillon, B.; Martens-Habbena, W.","Global sea-level rise is transforming coastal ecosystems, especially freshwater wetlands, in part due to increased episodic or chronic saltwater exposure, leading to shifts in biogeochemistry, plant- and microbial communities, as well as ecological services. Yet, it is still difficult to predict how soil microbial communities respond to the saltwater exposure because of poorly understood microbial sensitivity within complex wetland soil microbial communities, as well as the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of wetland soils and saltwater exposure. To address this, we first conducted a two-year survey of microbial community structure and bottom water chemistry in submerged surface soils from 14 wetland sites across the Florida Everglades. We identified ecosystem-specific microbial biomarker taxa primarily associated with variation in salinity. Bacterial, archaeal and fungal community composition differed between freshwater, mangrove, and marine seagrass meadow sites, irrespective of soil type or season. Especially, methanogens, putative denitrifying methanotrophs and sulfate reducers shifted in relative abundance and/or composition between wetland types. Methanogens and putative denitrifying methanotrophs declined in relative abundance from freshwater to marine wetlands, whereas sulfate reducers showed the opposite trend. A four-year experimental simulation of saltwater intrusion in a pristine freshwater site and a previously saltwater-impacted site corroborated the highest sensitivity and relative increase of sulfate reducers, as well as taxon-specific sensitivity of methanogens, in response to continuously pulsing of saltwater treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that besides increased salinity, saltwater-mediated increased sulfate availability leads to displacement of methanogens by sulfate reducers even at low or temporal salt exposure. These changes of microbial composition could affect organic matter degradation pathways in coastal freshwater wetlands exposed to sea-level rise, with potential consequences, such as loss of stored soil organic carbon.

Density slopes in variable density flow modeling,"Guo, W.","Variable density flow (VDF) modeling is a valuable tool for assessing the potential impacts of global climate change and sea level rise on coastal aquifers. When using any of these modeling tools, a quantitative relationship is needed to compute the fluid density from salt concentration. A full understanding of the relationship between fluid density and solute concentration and the correct implementation of the equation of state are critical for variable density modeling. The works of Baxter and his colleagues in the early 20th century showed that fluid density could be linearly correlated to salt concentrations. A constant density slope of 0.7 is often assumed and applied. The assumption is reasonable when the salinity is less than 100â°. The density slope can also be defined from chloride concentration data with the assumption of a constant ratio (55%) between chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS). Field data from central Florida indicate that the chloride/TDS ratio can be as low as 5%. Therefore, TDS is the preferred water quality data for fluid density determination in variable density modeling. Other issues with density slope are also discussed, and some commonly used values of density slope are provided in this technical note. Â© 2021 by the author.

Saltwater Intrusion Intensifies Coastal Permafrost Thaw,"Guimond, J.A.; Mohammed, A.A.; Walvoord, M.A.; Bense, V.F.; Kurylyk, B.L.","Surface effects of sea-level rise (SLR) in permafrost regions are obvious where increasingly iceless seas erode and inundate coastlines. SLR also drives saltwater intrusion, but subsurface impacts on permafrost-bound coastlines are unseen and unclear due to limited field data and the absence of models that include salinity-dependent groundwater flow with solute exclusion and freeze-thaw dynamics. Here, we develop a numerical model with the aforementioned processes to investigate climate change impacts on coastal permafrost. We find that SLR drives lateral permafrost thaw due to depressed freezing temperatures from saltwater intrusion, whereas warming drives top-down thaw. Under high SLR and low warming scenarios, thaw driven by SLR exceeds warming-driven thaw when normalized to the influenced surface area. Results highlight an overlooked feedback mechanism between SLR and permafrost thaw with potential implications for coastal infrastructure, ocean-aquifer interactions, and carbon mobilization.

Sustainable management of two-directional lateral and upconing saltwater intrusion in coastline aquifers to alleviate water scarcity,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Kuriqi, A.; Bhat, S.A.; Zelenakova, M.","Lateral saltwater intrusion (LSWI) and vertical saltwater intrusion (VSWI) are the major problems in coastal aquifers. Coastal aquifers are subjected to natural and artificial changes, including sea-level rise, decreasing inland recharge, and overexploitation of production wells' water resources. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of changing the coastal aquifers boundary conditions considering climate changes' effect. Parameters describing the upward saline well parameters based on the abstraction conditions, also, the top layer properties were studied based on the erosion and sediments, irrigation, and drainage conditions. For this purpose, the SEAWAT model was employed to simulate lateral SWI based on Henry's problem principle. The sensitivity analysis of the mentioned parameters was accomplished considering as a case study the Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA, where the LSWI and VSWI were also investigated. The results indicate that the boundary conditions, abstraction well parameters, and top layer cost significantly impact aquifer LSWI and water upconing. The simulation results of the Biscayne aquifer for a saline water head of 84.86 cm for 2060 indicate a decrease in freshwater recharge by 30% and increasing the saltwater concentration by 14.30%. At the same time, the LSWI increased by 3.30%, 22.80%, and 8.70%, while the relative upconing heights reached 0.63, 0.60, and 0.47 compared with 0.42 for the current situation. Increasing the upward saline abstraction well discharge rates by 50% increases the LSWI by 9.40%. In contrast, increasing the depth by 10%; decreases the distance by 30%, the screen length by 30%, the LSWI decreased by 1.80%, 25.10%, and 1.30%, respectively. At the same time, the relative VSWI height reached 0.60, 0.39, 0.48, and 0.40, respectively. Moreover, decreasing the top layer hydraulic conductivity by 25% and increasing the aquitards layer depths by 200% decreased the LSWI by 4.90% and 7.80%, respectively. At the same time, the relative VSWI height reached 0.34 and 0.30, respectively. In addition, the saline water heads, a freshwater recharge should be controlled to manage SWI; the upward well should be utilized at a low abstraction rate, far from the seaside, and with minimum screen length. The agriculture activity for decreasing the soil permeability for the top layer must be extended for better management of the SWI. The solution-oriented findings resulting from this study might be useful for decision-makers and engineers to develop effective management measures to tackle the SWI issue in coastal aquifers.

Detecting Coastal Wetland Degradation by Combining Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Modeling,"He, K.; Zhang, Y.; Li, W.; Sun, G.; McNulty, S.","Sea-level rise and climate change stresses pose increasing threats to coastal wetlands that are vital to wildlife habitats, carbon sequestration, water supply, and other ecosystem services with global significance. However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensingâhydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Effects of saltwater intrusion and sea level rise on aging and corrosion rates of iron pipes in water distribution and wastewater collection systems in coastal areas,"Tansel, B.; Zhang, K.","Failure of water distribution and wastewater collection pipes can impact human health and environment due to potential contamination of water and soil in the surrounding areas, as well as service interruptions and road closures. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of projected shifts in failure rates of iron pipes due to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise in coastal areas. Probability of pipe failure depends on pipe characteristics, environmental parameters, and systems conditions. Analyses showed that saltwater intrusion and sea level rise can significantly affect the integrity of water and wastewater collection pipes due to potential changes in soil and groundwater characteristics that increase corrosion rates. Corrosion rate is intensified by increased conductivity of groundwater due to salinity. Coastal areas with subtropical climate have higher corrosion rates. The estimated lifetimes of ductile iron pipes are between 80 and 100 years. However, the actual service lifetimes can be significantly shorter. Pipes in subtropical areas corrode significantly faster than those in temperate climates. Presence of dissolved oxygen and chloride ion can significantly intensify the corrosion rates, shortening service times of iron pipes. Projections for pipe corrosion can help development of effective asset management strategies and for infrastructure maintenance planning in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise.

Historical urban development was accompanied by impacts on shallow groundwater, and in the future subsurface environments, including underground infrastructure, will face additional pressure. This article reviews processes of the coastal groundwater zone and simulation tools used to evaluate possible impacts of sea-level rise. The benefits and limitations of the two main methods to assess coastal groundwater rise and contribution to flooding are discussed using studies and investigations up to 2021. The review addresses challenges associated with the simulation tools to evaluate changes in urban hydrogeology due to sea-level rise. The models reviewed do not specifically estimate groundwater contribution to land-surface flooding. We highlight a critical need for methodology comparisons between spatial interpolation and numerical tools that will guide future work. An adequate validation of assessment methods is required and will be supported by improved coastal groundwater monitoring networks focused on water quality, saltwater intrusion, and continuous groundwater levels records. From current monitoring practices, evidence for groundwater rise with rising sea level is not widely observed at present.

Diversity analyses using 18S rRNA gene metabarcodes identified salinity as a factor impacting soil metazoan composition. Nematoda and Mollusca were equally distributed across salinity zones. Gastrotricha, Bryozoa, Rotifera, and Platyhelminthes were more prevalent in low salinity while Kinorhyncha were not detected in low salinity. Annelida and insects were equally common in low and high salinity but less in mid salinity. Five nematodes (Eumonhystera filiformis, two Prismatolaimus spp., Anoplostoma sp., and Prodorylaimus sp.), two annelids (Marionina southerni and Dendronereis aestuarina), two platyhelminthes (Rhynchoscolex simplex and Olisthanella truncula), the gastrotrich Chaetonotus novenarius and four collembola and ostracods appear to be low salinity bioindicators and are expected to expand range with freshwater diversions. No frequently detected organisms were unique to mid or high salinity zones, but four Nematoda (Meleidogyne spartinae, Prochaetosoma sp., Halalaimus sp., and Dichromadora sp.), two Annelida (Alitta succinea and Namalycastis jaya), two Platyhelminthes (Macrostomum kepneri and Mesorhynchus terminostylis), and one Kinorhyncha (Echinoderes sp.) were never detected in low salinity zones. None of the frequently detected taxa were unique for a particular distance from the marsh edge or bay. This dataset will be useful as baseline for assessing how soil communities will change in response to salinity changes caused by freshwater diversions and saltwater intrusion as well as measuring the environmental impact of pollution and other stressors.

Impact of Coastal Marsh Eco-Geomorphologic Change on Saltwater Intrusion Under Future Sea Level Rise,"Zhang, Y.; Svyatsky, D.; Rowland, J.C.; Moulton, J.D.; Cao, Z.; Wolfram, P.J.; Xu, C.; Pasqualini, D.","Coastal saltwater intrusion (SWI) is one key factor that affects the hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of coastal ecosystems. Future climate change, especially intensified sea level rise (SLR), is expected to trigger SWI to encroach on coastal freshwater aquifers more intensively. Numerous studies have investigated decadal/century scale SWI under SLR by assuming a static coastal landscape topography. However, coastal landscapes are highly dynamic in response to SLR, and the impact of coastal landscape evolution on SWI has received very little attention. Thus, this study used a coastal marsh landscape as an example and investigated how coastal marsh evolution affects future SWI with a physically-based coastal hydro-eco-geomorphologic model, Advanced Terrestrial Simulator. Our numerical experiments showed that it is very likely that the marsh elevation increases with future SLR due to sediment deposition, and a depression zone is formed due to different marsh accretion rates between the ocean boundary and the inland. We found that marsh accretion may significantly reduce the surface saltwater inflow at the ocean boundary, and the evolved topographic depression zone may prolong the residence time of surface ponded saltwater, affecting subsurface salinity distribution differently. We also predicted that marshlands may become more sensitive to upland freshwater supply under future SLR, compared with previous predictions without marsh evolution. This study demonstrates the importance of coastal evolution to coastal freshwater-saltwater interaction. The eco-geomorphologic effect may not be ignored when evaluating coastal SWI under SLR at decadal or century scales. Â© 2022 The Authors.",2022,,Water Resour.

Resilience-Oriented Practices in Sea-LevelRise-Induced Human Migration in Coastal Bangladesh and Louisiana,"Ahsan, M.M.; Ãzbek, N.","Sea-Level Rise (SLR) combines slow- and rapid-onset climatic events and produces both environmental-induced migration and forced displacement. The coastal areas of Bangladesh and of the U.S. state of Louisiana are vulnerable to coastal or tidal flooding, saltwater intrusion, and other climatic events, which might worsen because of SLR. These coasts are facing adversity with persistent resolve due to the displacement of people from the coast due to SLR. On the basis of a systematic literature review of secondary sources, this study found that national, federal, or local governments are implementing several structural and non-structural resilience-oriented practices to keep people in their existing place. The study emphasizes that flood insurance is a resilience tool to protect residents and to help them in their existing location, but it requires adequate implementation. The study found that both structural and non-structural resilience practices with the necessary policy measures; political will; maintenance of the status quo with proper implementation of policies, plans, and programs; integration of resilience-oriented practices with relevant plans, policies, and programs; local people participation in the policymaking and implementation processes can avert people from migrating from sea-level-rise-induced impacts in both studied areas. Restoring both delta regions and giving importance to socioeconomic, ecological, and cultural aspects will be a win-win approach. Â© 2022.

Physiological and life history responses in a mayfly (Callibaetis floridanus) inhabiting ponds with saltwater intrusion,"Cochran, J.K.; Funk, D.H.; Buchwalter, D.B.","Freshwater salinity varies in natural systems and plays a role in species distribution. Anthropogenic alterations to freshwater salinity regimes include sea level rise and subsequent intrusion of saline waters to inland habitats. While mayflies are generalized to be sensitive to increasing salinity, we still know remarkably little about the physiological processes (and their plasticity) that determine the performance of species in a changing world. Here, we explored life-history outcomes and physiological plasticity in a population of Callibaetis floridanus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) from a coastal pond that routinely experiences saltwater intrusion. We reared naiads from egg hatch to adulthood across a gradient of increasing salinities (113, 5,020, 9,921 Î¼S/cm). Radiotracer flux studies (22Na, 35SO4, and 45Ca) were conducted in naiads reared at each salinity, revealing a positive association between ionic concentration and uptake rates. However, the influence of rearing history on ionic influx rates was apparent when naiads were transferred from their respective rearing water to the other experimental conditions. For example, we observed that naiads reared in the low salinity treatment (113 Î¼S/cm) had 10.8-fold higher Na uptake rates than naiads reared at 9,921 Î¼S/cm and transferred to 113 Î¼S/cm. Additionally, naiads acclimated to the higher salinity water exhibited reduced uptake in ion-rich water relative to those reared in more dilute conditions (e.g., in 9,921 Î¼S/cm water, 113 and 5,020 Î¼S/cm acclimated naiads had 1.5- and 1.1-fold higher Na uptake rates than 9,921 Î¼S/cm acclimated naiads, respectively). We found no significant changes in survival (80 Â± 4.4%, mean Â± s.e.m.) or naiad development time (24 Â± 0.3 days, mean Â± s.e.m.) across these treatments but did observe a 27% decrease in subimago female body weight in the most dilute condition. This reduction in female weight was associated with higher oxygen consumption rates in naiads relative to the other rearing conditions. Collectively, these data suggests that saline adapted C. floridanus may be more energetically challenged in dilute conditions, which differs from previous observations in other mayfly species.

Sustainable saltwater intrusion management in coastal aquifers under climatic changes for humid and hyper-arid regions,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Straface, S.; Kuriqi, A.","Saltwater Intrusion (SWI) in many coastal areas is accelerated by freshwater boundary changes due to over-pumping and decreasing aquifer recharge and sea-level rise. This study aims to control SWI due to the rise in sea levels in three climate regions: (i) humid and wet regions using storage dams at different heads and recharge ponds, (ii) hyper-arid and arid regions using physical barriers and wastewater treatment aquifer, brackish water abstraction, and desalination (TRAD) method, and (iii) semi-arid and semi-humid regions using a combination of flooding water recharge well-field and cut-off wall. The study was developed using the world benchmark problem of Henry's problem and Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA. The finite-difference code SEAWAT was used in numerical simulations. The numerical results indicated that increasing the artificial recharge lake capacity minimizes the SWI in humid and wet regions with a high level of flooding. Moreover, the intrusion is mitigated using physical barriers and the TRAD method for hyper-arid and arid regions. Combining physical barriers during dry seasons and recharge wells for wet seasons resulted in suitable measures to managed the SWI in semi-arid and semi-humid regions. Finally, the best strategy to mitigate the SWI and minimize the desalination costs depends on the precipitation rates. Therefore, the methodology applied to this study represents a valuable tool in order to select the best method based on the climate conditions and particularly the precipitation intensity to increase the water budget in freshwater aquifers.

"Saltwater intrusion ecophysiological effects on Pseudophoenix sargentii, Roystonea regia, Sabal palmetto âLisa,â and Thrinax radiata in South Florida","Khoddamzadeh, A.A.; Flores, J.; Griffith, M.P.; Souza Costa, B.N.","Climate change will alter natural areas on a global scale within the next century, especially in low-lying coastal areas where sea-level rise is predicted to severely degrade or destroy many ecosystems. As sea-level rise continues, it is expected that salinity due to saltwater intrusion will impact soil health and agricultural production, this is of even greater importance in areas such as South Florida where the surface and groundwater resources are hydrologically connected due to the shallow and highly permeable limestone soils. The chlorophyll concentrations in leaf tissue were chosen as the primary health indicator to assess whether this is a valuable factor to consider for plant health risk assessment and whether optical sensor technology such as the SPAD and NDVI, are valuable tools when understanding the impact seawater encroachment has on plant nitrogen uptake. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of salt concentrations on plant growth and health of four palm species. The treatments were from pure reverse osmosis water, Fresh water, brackish water, seawater and hypersaline water (0, 0.5, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 ppt). Control treatment that received reverse osmosis filtrated water with a salinity concentration of 0 ppt had the highest health-indicator averages compared to treatment 50 ppt. As the salinity increased, all health indicators gradually declined or remained rather constant and declined as they approached the greater salinity concentrations. The growth parameters and chlorophyll content were reduced over time, particularly at higher salt concentrations for all palm species studied. The chlorophyll content by SPAD and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used as health indicators of the palm species studied, as it was observed in this study a decline in the chlorophyll content as there was an increase in salt concentrations. It is important to emphasize that leaf chlorosis and subsequent decline of palm species were observed in the treatment with higher salt concentration, thus highlighting the importance of chlorophyll content as an indicator of plant health. The species Roystonea regia was very susceptible to salinity, and the palm Sabal palmetto is more susceptible to salinity than the Thrinax radiata and Pseudophoenix sargentii palms.

Understanding Peat Soil Deformation and Mechanisms of Peat Collapse Across a Salinity Gradient in the Southwestern Everglades,"Sirianni, M.J.; Comas, X.; Mount, G.J.; Pierce, S.; Coronado-Molina, C.; Rudnick, D.","Saltwater intrusion is a significant threat to the structure and ecology of inland and coastal freshwater wetlands, altering biogeochemical cycling and disrupting important ecosystem services. As sea level rises along the Florida coast, the saltwater interface progressively moves further inland reaching freshwater soils previously unexposed to saltwater. One result of this soil salinization is a phenomenon called peat collapse which is currently observable along the South Florida coastline. While previous studies have proposed conceptual models to explain peat collapse many uncertainties still exist regarding the physical mechanisms that trigger this phenomenon. In this study we use a unique combination of laboratory and field-based measurements using geophysical methods, deformation rods, gas traps, time-lapse photography, and hydraulic conductivity measurements to investigate the effects of salinization on the physical properties of peat soils across a salinity gradient in the southwestern Everglades. Our results show that freshwater peat soils have about three times greater degree of pore dilation when compared to peat soils previously exposed to saltwater conditions. Differences in soil surface deformation were also observed and related to differences in the soil matrix physical integrity across the salinity gradient. This work also uses electrical resistivity imaging surveys to image areas of peat collapse and demonstrates: (a) the role of salinity in the development of collapse features; and (b) the apparent lack of evidence to suggest subsurface lithological controls on the development of collapse features. A simplified conceptual framework for better understanding peat collapse and pock formation is presented. Â© 2023. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",2023,,Water Resour.

Effects of Storm Surge Barrier Closures on Estuary Saltwater Intrusion and Stratification,"Chen, Z.; Orton, P.M.","Gated storm surge barriers have been constructed or proposed in many estuaries worldwide for coastal flood risk reduction. Past studies have shown that, even when open, a barrier system's fixed infrastructure can increase estuary stratification and salt intrusion, potentially affecting water quality and ecological processes. However, surge barrier closures could have a much stronger influence on estuary conditions by temporarily blocking the tidal exchange. In this project, we use an existing regional three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, with modifications to simulate surge barrier closure and reopening, to study the effects on estuarine salt intrusion and stratification of the Hudson River. Across a range of modeled scenarios of gate closure frequencies, durations and river streamflows, we evaluate the changes caused by gate closures, as well as the recovery time to normal conditions. Our results for the Hudson show long-duration gate closures (three or more days) with low streamflows temporarily lead to salt intrusion and stratification beyond recent historical extremes. Moreover, monthly frequency closures, which could occur as soon as 2070 under realistic scenarios of sea-level rise and barrier management, do not allow for recovery under low streamflow conditions and could lead to durable changes to estuary physical conditions. As a result, long duration closures and high-frequency closures both constitute a threat to municipal water supplies. This study demonstrates a framework for understanding the potential impacts of any proposed surge barrier system and can help improve our understanding of corresponding ecological impacts. Â© 2023.

A phenology- and trend-based approach for accurate mapping of sea-level driven coastal forest retreat,"Chen, Y.; Kirwan, M.L.","The rapid replacement of upland forest by encroaching marshland is a striking manifestation of global sea-level rise (SLR). Timely and high-resolution information on the location and extent of transition forest (the ecotone between upland forest and marsh where tree mortality due to seawater intrusion begins) is fundamental to understanding the processes and patterns of SLR-driven landscape reorganization. Despite its significance, accurate characterization of salt-impacted transition forest remains challenging due to the complexity of coastal environments, scarcity of ground-truth data, and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. Here we use the full archive of Landsat images between 1984 and 2021 to investigate the spectral, temporal, and phenological characteristics of transition forest, and develop a robust framework for monitoring coastal vegetation shifts in the mid-Atlantic U.S., a global SLR hotspot. We found that transition forest exhibits strong negative NDVI trends and a deviation of land surface phenology from marsh and upland forest that distinguishes itself from surrounding vegetation. By integrating temporal trends and land surface phenology, our results demonstrate superior discrimination between marsh and coastal forests to existing map products (e.g. NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, National Land Cover Database) that allows a reliable identification of the coastal treeline. We applied the approach to map regional land cover in 1985, 2000 and 2020 (overall classification accuracy >92%) and found that the area of coastal forest decreased by 22.0% from 1985 to 2020, the majority of which transitioned to marshland (92.3%, 5.3 Ã 103 ha). Based upon fine-scale patterns of coastal transgression, we created a practical workflow for spatially explicit quantification of forest retreat rates. Concurrent with rising sea level, coastal forests migrated upslope from 0.63 (Â± 0.27) m above sea level in 1985 to 0.78 (Â± 0.32) m above sea level in 2020, and horizontal forest retreat rates accelerated from 3.1 (range of 0â36) m yrâ1 during 1985â2000 to 4.7 (0â55) m yrâ1 during 2001â2020. As SLR continues to accelerate, our study may serve as a scalable solution for consistent tracking of coastal landscape evolution that is urgently needed for sustainable forest and wetland management.

Modeling impacts of drought-induced salinity intrusion on carbon dynamics in tidal freshwater forested wetlands,"Wang, H.; Dai, Z.; Trettin, C.C.; Krauss, K.W.; Noe, G.B.; Burton, A.J.; Stagg, C.L.; Ward, E.J.","Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide critical ecosystem services including an essential habitat for a variety of wildlife species and significant carbon sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration.

Associations between climate variables and water quality in low- and middle-income countries: A scoping review,"Nijhawan, A.; Howard, G.","Understanding how climate change will affect water quality and therefore, health, is critical for building resilient water services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the effect of climate change will be felt most acutely. Evidence of the effect of climate variables such as temperate and rainfall on water quality can generate insights into the likely impact of future climate change. While the seasonal effects on water quality are known, and there is strong qualitative evidence that climate change will impact water quality, there are no reviews that synthesise quantitative evidence from LMICs on links between climate variables and water quality. We mapped the available evidence on a range of climate exposures and water quality outcomes and identified 98 peer-reviewed studies. This included observational studies on the impact of temperature and rainfall events (which may cause short-term changes in contaminant concentrations), and modelling studies on the long-term impacts of sea level rise. Evidence on links between antecedent rainfall and microbiological contamination of water supplies is strong and relatively evenly distributed geographically, but largely focused on faecal indicator bacteria and on untreated shallow groundwater sources of drinking water. The literature on climate effects on geogenic contaminants was sparse. There is substantial research on the links between water temperature and cyanobacteria blooms in surface waters, although most studies were from two countries and did not examine potential effects on water treatment. Similarly, studies modelling the impact of sea level rise on groundwater salinity, mostly from south-Asia and the Middle East, did not discuss challenges for drinking water supplies. We identified key future research priorities based on this review. These include: more studies on specific pathogens (including opportunistic pathogens) in water supplies and their relationships with climate variables; more studies that assess likely relationships between climate variables and water treatment processes; studies into the relationships between climate variables and geogenic contaminants, including risks from heavy metals released as glacier retreat; and, research into the impacts of wildfires on water quality in LMICs given the current dearth of studies but recognised importance.

"Connecting Future Environmental Trends and Assessments of Fish and Wildlife Resources of Concern: A Case Study of Big Pine Key, Florida","Miller, L.A.; Harwell, M.C.","Changes in hydrologic and climatic trends will influence the ecology of Florida, and climate scenarios agree that many areas of Florida are susceptible to sea-level rise impacts. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceâs Climate Change Action Program focuses on a framework to examine climate change effects on fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats of all three. To follow the program, this study examines how to incorporate current scientific knowledge about regional climate projections in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyses. It provides climate change and sea-level rise projections based on 2017 projections, information on changes in tropical cyclones, temperatures, and precipitation. This study also examines future effects of sea-level rise on existing habitat from saltwater intrusion of the freshwater lens below Big Pine Key. Projections of future sea-water elevations will periodically be reached or exceeded well before 2040 from short-term, stochastic, and extreme events (e.g., king tides and storm surge), and will increasingly inundate the root zone before complete saltwater intrusion. Future trends were connected to 2017 stakeholder-driven conversations about adaptation strategies to develop a suite of actions for creating temporary or permanent freshwater resources. However, beyond 3 ft (0.9 m) of sea-level rise, there are few adaptation options available for the Florida Key deer beyond relocations outside of the Florida Keys. Overall, the approach of connecting future environmental trends to assessments of fish and wildlife resources of concern can be transferred to other situations. Additionally, this approach can be used to update these analyses, such as with the recent 2022 sea-level rise updates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, released after this work was conducted.

"Future changes in habitat availability for two specialist snake species in the imperiled rocklands of South Florida, USA","Subedi, S.C.; Walls, S.C.; Barichivich, W.J.; Boyles, R.; Ross, M.S.; Hogan, J.A.; Tupy, J.A.","Rockland habitat in South Florida, USA, is a threatened ecosystem that has been lost, fragmented, or degraded because of urbanization or other anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore, low-lying islands and coastal areas are experiencing sea level rise (SLR) and an increased frequency and intensity of tidal flooding, putting rockland habitats there at increasing risk of ecological change. We evaluated changes in the extent of rockland habitat under various scenarios of future SLR, tidal flooding, and human development for two endemic state-listed threatened species of snakes, the Rim Rock Crowned Snake (Tantilla oolitica) and the Key Ring-necked Snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus). Both snakes are restricted to South Florida. We used recent and historical species' records to determine each species' habitat range. We then estimated the extent of future habitat loss due to SLR and continued human development, as well as degradation of the remaining habitat. We also asked whether the future potential drivers of habitat loss and degradation differ between the two species and across their habitat ranges. We predicted that saltwater intrusion could negatively affect rocklands by 2050, resulting in degradation of 80% of the existing habitat because of an anticipated 42 cm of SLR. Moreover, our model suggests short-term stochastic events such as storm surge and high tides may increasingly saturate the root zone of rockland vegetation before complete inundation. Under the extreme scenario, we predict most of the rockland habitat used by these two species of snakes may be inundated by 2080. Under the extreme SLR scenario, current rocklands are likely to convert to more halophytic habitat (mangrove or salt marsh wetland) within 50â60 years. Under the low scenario, 31% of rockland habitat may be lost due to human development by 2030. Therefore, mitigation actions may help to conserve specialist species within rockland habitat threatened by human activities and climate change. Â© 2022 The Authors.

Saltwater and phosphorus drive unique soil biogeochemical processes in freshwater and brackish wetland mesocosms,"Servais, S.; Kominoski, J.S.; Fernandez, M.; Morales, K.","Coastal ecosystems are exposed to saltwater intrusion but differential effects on biogeochemical cycling are uncertain. We tested how elevated salinity and phosphorus (P) individually and interactively affect microbial activities and biogeochemical cycling in freshwater and brackish wetland soils. In experimental mesocosms, we added crossed gradients of elevated concentrations of soluble reactive PÂ (SRP) (0,Â 20, 40, 60, 80Â Î¼g/L) and salinity (0, 4, 7, 12, 16 ppt) to freshwater and brackish peat soils (10, 14, 17, 22, 26 ppt) for 35 d. We quantified changes in water chemistry [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium ((Formula presented.)), nitrate + nitrite (NÂ +Â N), SRP concentrations], soil microbial extracellular enzyme activities, respiration rates, microbial biomass C, and soil chemistry (%C, %N, %P, C:N, C:P, N:P). DOC, (Formula presented.), and SRP increased in freshwater but decreased in brackish mesocosms with elevated salinity. DOC similarly decreased in brackish mesocosms with added P, and NÂ +Â N decreased with elevated salinity in both freshwater and brackish mesocosms. In freshwater soils, water column P uptake occurred only in the absence of elevated salinity and when P was above 40Â Âµg/L. Freshwater microbial EEAs, respiration rates, and microbial biomass C were consistently higher compared to those from brackish soils, and soil phosphatase activities and microbial respiration rates in freshwater soils decreased with elevated salinity. Elevated salinity increased arylsulfatase activities and microbial biomass C in brackish soils, and elevated P increased microbial respiration rates in brackish soils. Freshwater soil %C, %N, %P decreased and C:P and N:P increased with elevated salinity. Elevated P increased %C and C:N in freshwater soils and increased %P but decreased C:P and N:P in brackish soils. Freshwater soils released more C and nutrients than brackish soils when exposed to elevated salinity, and both soils were less responsive to elevated P than expected. Freshwater soils became more nutrient-depleted with elevated salinity, whereas brackish soils were unaffected by salinity but increased P uptake. Microbial activities in freshwater soils were inhibited by elevated salinity and unaffected by added P, but brackish soil microbial activities slightly increased with elevated salinity and P.

Water Column Microbial Communities Vary along Salinity Gradients in the Florida Coastal Everglades Wetlands,"Laas, P.; Ugarelli, K.; Travieso, R.; Stumpf, S.; Gaiser, E.E.; Kominoski, J.S.; Stingl, U.","Planktonic microbial communities mediate many vital biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems, yet compared to other aquatic ecosystems, like oceans, lakes, rivers or estuaries, they remain relatively underexplored. Our study site, the Florida Everglades (USA)âa vast iconic wetland consisting of a slow-moving system of shallow rivers connecting freshwater marshes with coastal mangrove forests and seagrass meadowsâis a highly threatened model ecosystem for studying salinity and nutrient gradients, as well as the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. This study provides the first high-resolution phylogenetic profiles of planktonic bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities (using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) together with nutrient concentrations and environmental parameters at 14 sites along two transects covering two distinctly different drainages: the peat-based Shark River Slough (SRS) and marl-based Taylor Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph). Both bacterial as well as eukaryotic community structures varied significantly along the salinity gradient. Although freshwater communities were relatively similar in both transects, bac-terioplankton community composition at the ecotone (where freshwater and marine water mix) differed significantly. The most abundant taxa in the freshwater marshes include heterotrophic Polynucleobacter sp. and potentially phagotrophic cryptomonads of the genus Chilomonas, both of which could be key players in the transfer of detritus-based biomass to higher trophic levels.

Environmental Limits on the Spread of Invasive Phragmites australis into Upland Forests with Marine Transgression,"Shaw, P.; Jobe, J.; Gedan, K.B.","Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan grass that has transformed tidal wetlands in regions where it is invasive. The position of P. australis at the upland margin of tidal wetlands makes it likely to be among the earliest species to colonize uplands in marshes responding to sea-level rise; P. australis has been spreading in step with transgressive forest retreat. Considered a high light demanding species, the forest shade has been thought to keep this prolific species in check. In this study, we surveyed the distribution of P. australis across the marsh-forest ecotone, with particular attention to low-light areas in the forest understory, an environmental setting that has been largely overlooked in investigations of this well-studied species. We found P. australis to be present and well-established in forest canopy cover of up to 87.4%. However, canopy cover was significantly and negatively related to P. australis density in a multivariate model describing the speciesâ distribution in the ecotone. To test the speciesâ growth in shade conditions corresponding to the forest understory, we performed a greenhouse shading experiment. While photosynthetic parameters and growth rates were reduced in shade treatments, shade-grown individuals exhibited relatively high rates of photosynthesis in light-response tests, and there was no difference between the speciesâ performance in partial and deep shade treatments. We conclude that, while P. australis prefers high light conditions, it is able to colonize and survive low-light conditions in closed forest. By colonizing forest understory areas prior to other salt-tolerant species, P. australis is prepositioned to be the dominant species during saltwater intrusion and forest retreat.

Experimental and Numerical Study to Investigate the Impact of Changing the Boundary Water Levels on Saltwater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Abdel-Aal, G.M.; Fahmy, M.; Sherif, M.; ZeleÅÃ¡kovÃ¡, M.; Abd-Elaty, I.","Experimental and numerical models can be used to investigate saltwater intrusion (SWI) in coastal aquifers. Sea level rise (SLR) and decline of freshwater heads due to climate change are the two key variables that may affect saltwater intrusion. This study aims to give a better understanding of the impact of increasing seawater levels and decreasing freshwater heads due to climate change and increasing abstraction rates due to overpopulation using experimental and numerical models on SWI. The experimental model was conducted using a flow tank and the SEAWAT code was used for the numerical simulation. Different scenarios were examined to assess the effect of seawater rise and landside groundwater level decline. The experimental and numerical studies were conducted on three scenarios: increasing seawater head by 25%, 50% and 75% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, decreasing freshwater head by 75%, 50% and 25% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, and a combination of these two scenarios. Good agreement was attained between experimental and numerical results. The results showed that increasing the seawater level and decreasing freshwater head increased saltwater intrusion, but the combination of these two scenarios had a severe effect on saltwater intrusion. The numerical model was then applied to a real case study, the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. The results indicated that the Biscayne aquifer is highly vulnerable to SWI under the possible consequences of climate change. A 25 cm seawater rise and 28% reduction in the freshwater flux would cause a loss of 0.833 million m3 of freshwater storage per each kilometer width of the Biscayne aquifer. This study provides a better understanding and a quantitative assessment for the impacts of changing water levelsâ boundaries on intrusion of seawater in coastal aquifers. Â© 2022 by the authors.

"Coastal squeeze on temperate reefs: Long-term shifts in salinity, water quality, and oyster-associated communities","Tice-Lewis, M.; Zhang, Y.S.; Redding, S.G.; Lindquist, N.L.; Rodriguez, A.B.; Fieseler, C.M.; Walker, Q.A.; Fodrie, F.J.","Foundation species, such as mangroves, saltmarshes, kelps, seagrasses, and oysters, thrive within suitable environmental envelopes as narrow ribbons along the landâsea margin. Therefore, these habitat-forming species and resident fauna are sensitive to modified environmental gradients. For oysters, many estuaries impacted by sea-level rise, channelization, and municipal infrastructure are experiencing saltwater intrusion and water-quality degradation that may alter reef distributions, functions, and services. To explore decadal-scale oysterâreef community patterns across a temperate estuary in response to environmental change, we resampled reefs in the Newport RiverÂ Estuary (NRE) during 2013â2015 that had previously been studied during 1955â1956. We also coalesced historical NRE reef distribution (1880sâ2015), salinity (1913â2015), and water-quality-driven shellfish closure boundary (1970sâ2015) data to document environmental trends that could influence reef ecology and service delivery. Over the last 60â120 years, the entire NRE has shifted toward higher salinities. Consequently, oysterâreef communities have become less distinct across the estuary, manifest by 20%â27% lower species turnover and decreased faunal richness among NRE reefs in the 2010s relative to the 1950s. During the 2010s, NRE oysterâreef communities tended to cluster around a euhaline, intertidal-reef type more so than during the 1950s. This followed faunal expansions farther up estuary and biological degradation of subtidal reefs as NRE conditions became more marine and favorable for aggressive, reef-destroying taxa. In addition to these biological shifts, the area of suitable bottom on which subtidal reefs persist (contracting due to up-estuary intrusion of marine waters) and support human harvest (driven by water quality, eroding from up-estuary) has decreased by >75% since the natural history of NRE reefs was first explored. This âcoastal squeezeâ on harvestable subtidal oysters (reduced from a 4.5-km to a 0.75-km envelope along the NRE's main axis) will likely have consequences regarding the economic incentives for future oyster conservation, as well as the suite of services delivered by remaining shellfish reefs (e.g., biodiversity maintenance, seafood supply). More broadly, these findings exemplify how âsqueezeâ may be a pervasive concern for biogenic habitats along terrestrial or marine ecotones during an era of intense global change.

Potential management practices of saltwater intrusion impacts on soil health and water quality: A review,"Bayabil, H.K.; Li, Y.; Tong, Z.; Gao, B.","Several studies have documented the multifaceted impacts of climate change and variability on agricultural and environmental sustainability, and social and economic development. Climate change and variability contribute to increased warmer conditions, increased frequency of heavy rain that accounts for an increasing proportion of total rainfall, extreme weather characterized by spatially variable cycles of drought and wetness, increased frequency of tropical storms/hurricanes, increased frequency of storm surges, and accelerated rate of sea-level rise (SLR). As SLR continues, it is expected that salinity due to saltwater intrusion (SWI) will impact soil health and agricultural production. As such, the significant threats of salinity necessitate more work to be done to better understand its impact on soil health and associated functional ecosystem processes. This is of even greater importance in areas such as South Florida where the surface and groundwater resources are hydrologically connected due to the shallow and highly permeable limestone soils. A better understanding of the impacts of salinity due to SWI on soil health is critical to design effective mitigation strategies. Healthy soil has multifaceted benefits to enhance agricultural productivity, i.e. regulates the flow of water; serves as a source and sink of nutrients; minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and provides optimal biological and chemical conditions for the transformation of nutrients into plant-available forms. Improved understanding of the processes and impacts of SWI on soil health will assist in guiding management decisions and policies to mitigate the impacts of SWI and salinity on agricultural soils. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the impacts of SWI and soil salinity on agricultural soil health and water quality. Â© 2021 The Authors.",2021,,J. Water Clim.

"Methods for In-Silico Environmental Resilience, 2018 to 2100","Spiegelhalter, T.; Werner, L.C.","The research focuses on Genetic Water-Energy-Food Nexus Design Research Scenarios for Miami's Greater Islands. The Paris Agreement - 21st international Conference of Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) supports professional and municipal architecture and urban design practice emphasizing greenhouse gas reductions and carbon-neutral city planning and operations. In this respect, Miami benefits through multiple large-scale grants focusing on strategic solutions to combat and adapt to the effects of global warming, sea-level rise, flooding, hurricane impacts, and saltwater intrusion [1]. This paper presents research findings funded by a four-year transdisciplinary research project CRUNCH by EU agencies and the US-National Science Foundation in partnership with nineteen partners from six countries. It illuminates two transdisciplinary methods to produce bio-inspired infrastructural, architectural, and urban scale scenarios from 2018 to 2100. The silico-oriented research location is in Miami, proposing a trans-locational application envisaged in Berlin. The first method is based on parametric-algorithmic, generative design research workflows. The second utilizes synthetic biology through bio-scripting in collaboration with Autodesk. Both methods merge through the integration of cloud-based artificial intelligence and machine learning simulation engines. The research goals are to support international governments regarding sustainability master plans, and secondly, to raise and increase awareness towards urgent and societal relevant resilience topics for the future of human habitats. Scenario simulations are generated by the Florida International University (FIU) Miami research team at the Urban Living Lab (ULL), the GIS department, and two coastal cities in Miami Dade with low-lying areas.

Coastal Forest Dieback in the Northeast USA: Potential Mechanisms and Management Responses,"Sacatelli, R.; Kaplan, M.; Carleton, G.; Lathrop, R.G.","A number of studies have documented coastal forest dieback as a historical and ongoing process across the Northeast US region. To further develop a current understanding of the state of knowledge, review adaptation and response measures available to land managers, and to identify research and management needs, we conducted a literature review, interviewed experts, and convened a workshop bringing together scientists and land managers. A synthesis of the above suggests that the most important proximate mechanisms driving coastal forest dieback in the Northeast US are sea level rise-induced changes in the groundwater table in concert with increased saltwater inundation related to storm surges. What sets our conceptual model apart from prior work is the greater emphasis placed on the role of rising fresh groundwater levels in increasingly stressing the forest vegetation and decreasing regeneration potential. Episodic storm surges often exceed the salinity or saturation tolerances of existing trees leading to a wave of mortality that leaves the site inhospitable to subsequent regeneration. Maintaining functioning coastal forests across the Northeast US will require that the marsh and forest ecosystems be considered as an integrated unit when determining an appropriate adaptation response. With a better understanding of each of the sea level rise-induced mechanisms at work in these ecosystems, managers may be better prepared for the changes ahead and facilitate proactive adaptation strategies. Easements or buyouts are vital to ensure that there is ample space for the marsh and upland systems to migrate landward together. Forward thinking land use planning is needed to promote the âno net lossâ of both marsh and coastal forest ecosystems to ensure the continued provision of their vital services to society.

Effects of constant and fluctuating saltwater addition on CH4 fluxes and methanogens of a tidal freshwater wetland: A mesocosm study,"He, L.; She, C.; Huang, J.; Yang, P.; Yu, H.; Tong, C.","The importance of salinity in regulating CH4 emissions from coastal tidal wetlands has been widely recognized. However, the different effects of constant versus fluctuating salinity increases on CH4 emission and methanogens in both tidal freshwater marsh and floodplains are not yet well understood. We constructed mesocosm experiments on both a Cyperus malaccensis marsh and an adjacent non-vegetation-covered tidal floodplain over one year. We examined the effects of constant freshwater (CF), constant salinity (CS), and fluctuating salinity (FS) on porewater geochemistry, CH4 flux, methanogen abundance, diversity, and community structure in the tidal marsh and floodplain. Compared with CF treatment, methanogen abundance and Chao1 index were significantly lower in the marsh mesocosms under FS and CS treatment, but only in the floodplain mesocosms under CS treatment. CS treatment significantly reduced the proportion of Methanosarcinales but significantly increased the proportion of Methanobacteriales. Porewater SO42â and Clâ concentrations and pH were important factors affecting methanogen abundance and diversity. Both the CS and FS treatments considerably reduced CH4 fluxes in marsh and floodplain mesocosms; the main factor impacting CH4 flux was porewater dissolved CH4 concentration, and both methanogen abundance and Chao1 index were positively correlated with CH4 flux. Our results suggest that both continuous saltwater intrusion caused by sea-level rise and pulse saltwater intrusion perhaps caused by typhoons could reduce CH4 flux from subtropical estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands.

Impact of Channel Dredging and Straightening in an Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides L. (B.S.P.)) Freshwater Tidal Wetland,"Stotts, S.; Callahan, J.; Gulledge, O.","Stotts, S.; Callahan, J., and Gulledge, O., 2021. Impact of channel dredging and straightening in an Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides L. (B.S.P.)) freshwater tidal wetland. Journal of Coastal Research, 37(5), 973-986. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Once prominent up the eastern coast of the United States, freshwater wetlands with Atlantic white cedar (AWC; Chamaecyparis thyoides L. (B.S.P.)) are now vanishing due to saltwater intrusion and anthropogenic landscape alterations. This study utilizes a historic, anthropogenic disturbance to provide insight into the AWC response to salinization. A major straightening and dredging project in the 1920s, including 16 oxbow cuts, allowed brackish water to move upstream in the St. Jones River in Dover, Delaware, leading to the die-off of an AWC swamp. The sampled AWC experienced climate change, storms, hydrologic alterations, and sea-level rise. Annual ring width and suppression event chronologies were developed from dead AWC and were compared to groupings of climate variables in the predisturbance (1895-1920) and postdisturbance (1928-1958) periods. Results of the dendrochronological analysis indicate that the AWC in this study died at an average age of 49.3 years, earlier than typically expected for such species. After the straightening and dredging, the AWC experienced changes in growth response to temperature while suppression events became positively correlated with elevated temperature (p = 0.024) and high precipitation (p = 0.019). The system also showed signs of becoming more sensitive to storm events in the postdisturbance period. Â© 2021 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.",2021,,J. Coast.

Effects of waterlogging and salinity increase on CO2 efflux in soil from coastal marshes,"Li, Y.-L.; Ge, Z.-M.; Xie, L.-N.; Li, S.-H.; Tan, L.-S.","Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.

Review of Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures of Coastal Aquifers Vulnerable to Saline Water Intrusion,"Basack, S.; Loganathan, M.K.; Goswami, G.; Baruah, P.; Alam, R.","The extent of risk is the key measure of sustainable performance of engineering and natural systems and coastal aquifers are no exceptions. Aquifers in the coastal regions are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion (SWI) that attributes to the degradation of freshwater quality in the aquifers. The major factors that influence saline water intrusion are sea level rise due to climate change and the impact of human activities. The water quality erodes rapidly when these factors act simultaneously. Abstraction Desalinization Recharge (ADR) and Qanat-well structure methods are found to be effective methods to mitigate the risk in terms of cost and abstraction of groundwater in specific regions without intensifying saltwater intrusion.

Wetlands Under Global Change,"Ward, E.J.","Wetlands are among the ecosystem types most threatened by global change, including both climate change and other anthropogenic factors such as sea level rise, urban development, deforestation, agricultural land use, drainage, levees, tidal flow restrictions, pollution, eutrophication, and fires. Wetlands not only store disproportionate amounts of carbon compared to other terrestrial ecosystems, but they lie at the terrestrial-aquatic interface crucial to understanding landscape and global scale biogeochemical cycles. In this chapter, we focus on the major global change factors affecting wetlands and the responses of different wetland types to those global change factors. Special attention is given to direct responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Because of their hydrological connections and placement at the terrestrial-aquatic interface, the conservation of wetlands involves accounting for uncertainties related to interacting stressors. While the past decades have seen many important experimental and observational studies of wetland responses to global change factors, large uncertainties remain, especially within tropical regions where even the basic extent of wetland ecosystems is not well documented.

"Speculation on the role of sea-level rise in the tragic collapse of the Surfside condominium (Miami Beach, Florida U.S.A.) was a bellwether moment for coastal zone management practitioners","Parkinson, R.W.","The tragic collapse of the Surfside condominium was a bellwether moment in coastal zone management because it forever changed the way we think about risk and vulnerability of the built and human environment. Shortly afterwards, questions emerged regarding whether the structural integrity of the building was compromised by a rise in sea level caused by climate change. Historical trends in the elevation of sea-level, King Tides, and hurricane storm surge quantified between 1994 and 2020 reveal the number of times sea level rose to elevations above the building's basement floor increased from an average of 244 per year between 1994 and 2006 to 636 from 2007 to 2020. This is attributed to a 3-fold increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise that occurred after 2006. Conditions of increasing soil saturation caused by rising seas is likely on most other barrier islands. It follows the context in which we think about managing climate change in the coastal zone must be expanded to consider existing and future below-ground conditions, which to date has largely been overlooked by coastal zone management practitioners.

Future inundation of coastal on-site wastewater treatment systems in a region with pronounced sea-level rise,"Threndyle, R.E.; Jamieson, R.C.; Kennedy, G.; Lake, C.B.; Kurylyk, B.L.","An often-overlooked impact of rising sea levels is the concurrent rise in coastal groundwater tables, which can result in subsurface inundation of below-ground infrastructure. This is an important consideration for rural coastal communities, many of which rely on on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). Subsurface inundation and flooding of OWTS leads to treatment performance issues, potentially resulting in enhanced contaminant transport to coastal groundwater resources and the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge. We use SEAWAT to develop a variable-density groundwater flow model for the groundwater system underlying a densely populated rural community on the north shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. We then impose various climate change scenarios (sea-level rise, changes in recharge) to evaluate the risk of OWTS inundation from rising groundwater. We find that under current conditions as many as 9 % of OWTS in this small but densely populated watershed are either inundated or completely flooded. This number that could grow to 27 % of OWTS for the climate change scenario with the highest recharge and sea-level rise. As a secondary objective, we track the location of the modeled saltwater-freshwater interface, and investigate the potential salinization of groundwater resources used for drinking water supply. The modeled interface moved landward by â¤ 20 m and proved to be less of a concern than OWTS inundation, except for shoreline dwellings. We also use the modelling results to develop adaptation recommendations for OWTS installation regulations. This research contributes to an increasing number of groundwater modelling studies focusing on the impacts of sea-level rise on coastal subsurface infrastructure and provides important insight for rural coastal communities.

Deltas in arid environments,"Day, J.; Goodman, R.; Chen, Z.; Hunter, R.; Giosan, L.; Wang, Y.","Due to increasing water use, diversion and salinization, along with subsidence and sea-level rise, deltas in arid regions are shrinking worldwide. Some of the most ecologically important arid deltas include the Colorado, Indus, Nile, and Tigris-Euphrates. The primary stressors vary globally, but these deltas are threatened by increased salinization, water storage and diversion, eutrophication, and wetland loss. In order to make these deltas sustainable over time, some water flow, including seasonal flooding, needs to be re-established. Positive impacts have been seen in the Colorado River delta after flows to the delta were increased. In addition to increasing freshwater flow, collaboration among stakeholders and active management are necessary. For the Nile River, cooperation among different nations in the Nile drainage basin is important. River flow into the Tigris-Euphrates River delta has been affected by politics and civil strife in the Middle East, but some flow has been re-allocated to the delta. Studies commissioned for the Indus River delta recommended re-establishment of some monthly water flow to maintain the river channel and to fight saltwater intrusion. However, accelerating climate impacts, socio-political conflicts, and growing populations suggest a dire future for arid deltas. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Shrub expansion in maritime forest responding to sea level rise,"Sward, R.; Philbrick, A.; Morreale, J.; Baird, C.J.; Gedan, K.","Expansion of shrubs has been observed in a number of biomes and in response to diverse global change drivers. Noting shrub expansion in coastal forests affected by sea level rise, we began to monitor shrub populations in a transgressing loblolly pine forest in coastal Virginia. Forest study plots spanned a gradient of salinity and progression toward a ghost forest state, from high forest with a relatively closed canopy, to mid and low forest, where there were few remaining live canopy trees. Shrubs of the species Morella cerifera were censused for 3 years from 2019 to 2021. Shrub distributions were compared to distributions of the invasive grass Phragmites australis to test if competition with this invasive species played a role in the observed shrub distribution. Shrubs were most abundant in the mid forest, whereas P. australis was most abundant in the low forest, but we did not detect a negative correlation between changes in occupancy of P. australis and shrubs. Rapid growth of shrubs in the mid and high forest radically changed the forest understory structure during the study period. Basal area of shrubs in the mid and high forest tripled, and shrub occupancy increased from 45 to 66% in the high forest, with high patchiness between plots. A flooding event salinized the site in late 2019, during the study. Following the flood, soil porewater salinities in the low forest remained above levels known to cause mortality in M. cerifera for several months. We postulate that high salinity, rather than competition with P. australis, filters M. cerifera from the low forest, whereas moderate salinity in the mid and high forest favors M. cerifera growth and expansion. The increase in shrubs appears to be a hallmark of salt-affected maritime forest, with the shrub front occurring in advance of other indicators of transgression such as P. australis invasion.

Impacts of Saltwater Intrusion on Wetland Prey Production and Composition in a Historically Freshwater Marsh,"RomaÃ±ach, S.S.; Beerens, J.M.; Patton, B.A.; Chapman, J.P.; Hanson, M.R.","Sea level rise is a fundamental driver of ecosystem change and has the potential to shift the spatial distributions of habitats more rapidly than species can adapt. Rapid sea level rise and associated saltwater intrusion have negative impacts on coastal environments, including loss of habitat for species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. In Floridaâs largest wetland, the Everglades, the availability of small fishes that are prey for wading birds serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. In the southwestern part of the ecosystem, sea level rise and a reduction in freshwater flow have converted formerly freshwater marsh into an estuarine mangrove-dominated landscape. In this study, we sampled fish communities in this southwest portion of the Everglades exposed to a range of saline conditions. Biomass of native fishes was highest at a salinity value of approximately 25 parts per thousand, while non-native biomass decreased with increasing salinity. Applying salinity change scenarios, we determined that a 10% reduction from the salinity levels recorded in this study would be optimal for biomass of native fishes. The baseline data we collected on non-native fishes at the site will be useful for monitoring as restoration progresses and for managers working on invasive species control. This region has been actively undergoing ecosystem restoration for the last decade, but restored freshwater flow closer to historical conditions is still years away. Without increased freshwater inflow from hydrologic restoration, rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion may provide conservation challenges for wading birds and their prey-base fishes.

Laboratory and Numerical Investigation of Saltwater Intrusion Processes in a Circular Island Aquifer,"Memari, S.S.; Bedekar, V.S.; Clement, T.P.","A novel radial flow experimental system to study saltwater intrusion processes in an island aquifer is presented. The study investigated steady state and transient scenarios involving advancing and receding saltwater wedges in a circular island. The experimental results were simulated using the density-coupled version of the MODFLOW-USG code. The experimental data along with the model simulation results are employed to develop a new radial benchmark problem for testing density-coupled models used for simulating saltwater intrusion processes. The experimental data for transient changes in toe position and freshwater storage level indicated an asymmetric pattern where the intrusion time scale is greater than the recession time scale. Numerical experiments were completed to further investigate this asymmetric effect and to intercompare the associated transient transport processes in circular and linear strip islands. We also analyzed the sensitivity of island geometry in controlling the freshwater storage levels under different recharge conditions. Modeling results show that for similar-sized systems, circular islands are more efficient in storing freshwater than linear strip islands. Â© 2019. American Geophysical Union.

"Modeling Sea Level Rise Impact on Coot Bay Hammock, Florida Everglades","Kh'ng, X.Y.; Teh, S.Y.; Koh, H.L.","The low-lying Florida Everglades ecosystem maintains a delicate dynamic balance between freshwater and seawater. Hence, the Everglades is vulnerable to sharp salinity alterations induced by climate variations. The associated increase in surface seawater inundation and subsurface saltwater intrusion will reduce the availability of fresh groundwater. This would pose a risk to the Floridan surficial aquifer that provides potable water supply for millions of inhabitants in Florida. The increased salinity and decreased freshwater inputs will also alter coastal ecosystems by facilitating the establishment and encroachment of plants with higher salinity and flooding tolerance.

Saltwater intrusion affects nutrient concentrations in soil porewater and surface waters of coastal habitats,"Weissman, D.S.; Tully, K.L.","Coastal ecosystems are undergoing major biogeochemical shifts due to climate change and sea level rise. At the same time, agricultural fertilizer applications are increasing coastal nutrient inputs. In this study, we examine the potential impact of saltwater intrusion (SWI) on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in soil porewater and surface water of different habitats within the Chesapeake Bay estuary. Study sites are located along Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore and were monitored over three summers from 2016 to 2018. These sites encompass various habitats on the landâsea interface, consisting of healthy forests, intruded forests, abandoned fields, intruded fields, agricultural ditches, tidal creeks, and tidal salt marshes. Intruded fields were being actively farmed at the time of the study. Soil porewater and surface water grab samples were collected from the habitats and analyzed for electrical conductivity, pH, dissolved organic P (DOP), dissolved inorganic P in the form of soluble reactive P (SRP), dissolved inorganic N as ammonium-N (NH4-N), and total dissolved iron (TDFe). Electrical conductivity was greatest in the marshes (16.58Â mS/cm averaged across all years) and did not significantly differ among intruded forests, intruded fields, and agricultural ditches. As a legacy of heavy fertilizer use, DOP concentrations exceeded 0.45Â mgÂ P/L in all habitats. Concentrations of inorganic N and P differed significantly by habitat. Concentrations of NH4-N were significantly higher in salt marsh soil porewater than in any other habitat measured. Overall, SRP concentrations were the highest in the soil porewater of intruded fields and marshes and in the surface water of agricultural ditches (0.30, 0.29, and 0.33Â mgÂ P/L averaged across all years, respectively). These concentrations greatly exceeded recommended U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nutrient pollution thresholds for the region. In its oxidized state, dissolved iron can bind to SRP and prevent it from becoming bioavailable. However, TDFe concentrations in the ditches, tidal creeks, and marshes were too low to adequately buffer against SRP loss to downstream areas. As SWI moves salts inland and increases hydrologic connectivity across coastal landscapes, it is important to consider the mechanisms through which nutrients may be released from coastal soils and their potential to impact downstream water quality.

Novel microbial community composition and carbon biogeochemistry emerge over time following saltwater intrusion in wetlands,"Dang, C.; Morrissey, E.M.; Neubauer, S.C.; Franklin, R.B.","Sea level rise and changes in precipitation can cause saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater wetlands, leading to shifts in microbial metabolism that alter greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Saltwater intrusion modifies soil physicochemistry and can immediately affect microbial metabolism, but further alterations to biogeochemical processing can occur over time as microbial communities adapt to the changed environmental conditions. To assess temporal changes in microbial community composition and biogeochemical activity due to saltwater intrusion, soil cores were transplanted from a tidal freshwater marsh to a downstream mesohaline marsh and periodically sampled over 1Â year. This experimental saltwater intrusion produced immediate changes in carbon mineralization rates, whereas shifts in the community composition developed more gradually. Salinity affected the composition of the prokaryotic community but did not exert a strong influence on the community composition of fungi. After only 1Â week of saltwater exposure, carbon dioxide production doubled and methane production decreased by three orders of magnitude. By 1Â month, carbon dioxide production in the transplant was comparable to the saltwater controls. Over time, we observed a partial recovery in methane production which strongly correlated with an increase in the relative abundance of three orders of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Taken together, our results suggest that ecosystem responses to saltwater intrusion are dynamic over time as complex interactions develop between microbial communities and the soil organic carbon pool. The gradual changes in microbial community structure we observed suggest that previously freshwater wetlands may not experience an equilibration of ecosystem function until long after initial saltwater intrusion. Our results suggest that during this transitional period, likely lasting years to decades, these ecosystems may exhibit enhanced greenhouse gas production through greater soil respiration and continued methanogenesis.

Landscape-Level Consequences of Rising Sea-Level on Coastal Wetlands: Saltwater Intrusion Drives Displacement and Mortality in the Twenty-First Century,"Yu, M.; Rivera-Ocasio, E.; Heartsill-Scalley, T.; Davila-Casanova, D.; Rios-LÃ³pez, N.; Gao, Q.","Coastal wetlands are shrinking rapidly due to land-use activities. Accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) associated to the warming climate is also affecting coastal wetlands, particularly in islands with limited coastal plains. We analyzed coastal wetland changes in Puerto Rico by applying the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model under two scenarios by 2100. We also analyzed mortality and recruitment in a freshwater swamp dominated by the tree Pterocarpus officinalis Jacq. in the context of landscape saltwater-intrusion and drought. Our results indicate mangroves and estuarine water would replace the areas currently covered by other saltwater and freshwater wetlands, and saltmarsh would encounter the most relative loss among wetland types. A moderate SLR of 1Â m by 2100 allows expansion of mangroves but would decrease saltmarsh and freshwater wetlands. A 2-m SLR would decrease the distributions of all vegetated wetlands, mostly replaced by estuarine water. In the P. officinalis forest, saltwater-intrusion and drought increased tree mortality during 2003â2015 compared to 1994â2003. Saltwater intrusion had a more significant negative effect on tree recruitment than on mortality in this Pterocarpus forest. Coastal wetlands are facing challenges to their persistence at current locations due to accelerated SLR, limited coastal lands, and a modified hydrological regime.

Soil Salinity Impacts Future Community Composition of Coastal Forests,"Woods, N.N.; Swall, J.L.; Zinnert, J.C.","With projected increase in storms, sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion in low-lying terrestrial areas, compositional changes that favor more salt tolerant species are likely to occur. Wetland species are expanding into declining forested communities, primarily dominated by trees. Higher salinities for germination may preclude establishment of tree species. We examined the capacity for coastal tree species (Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua, Pinus taeda, Celtis occidentalis, Persea borbonia) and a wetland shrub (Morella cerifera) to germinate at salinity concentrations of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20Â ppt. A growth chamber experiment was established examining the effect of salinity on germination of common species found in mixed forests throughout the mid-Atlantic coastal plain and Gulf of Mexico, USA. The study revealed that regeneration from seed will be difficult for most of the selected species at salinities >5Â ppt with implications for community composition with continued saltwater intrusion. Germination of A. rubrum was not impacted at higher salinities, with Pinus taeda not as affected other species. Morella cerifera did not have an advantage at the germination stage over selected tree species.

Simulation-based assessment of adaptive planning in coastal water supply infrastructure systems,"Rasoulkhani, K.; Mostafavi, A.; Reyes, M.P.; Batouli, M.","Coastal water supply infrastructure systems (CWSIS) are exposed to saltwater intrusion (SWI) exacerbated by sea-level rise (SLR). While different factors contributing to the physical damage of SWI on CWSIS are well studied, little is known about the adaptive decision-making of institutional agencies in response to SWI impacts. This study developed a novel multi-agent simulation model that captures the coupled impacts of sea-level rise stressors and adaptation decision-making processes of utility agencies on the long-term resilience of CWSIS. The model was implemented using data collected from South Miami-Dade service area and then was used to design and test different scenarios pertaining to SLR and SWI projections as well as to adaptation decision-making factors. Accordingly, the long-term resilience of the system was assessed under various scenarios.

Assessing the âsuperposedâ effects of storm surge from a Category 3 hurricane and continuous sea-level rise on saltwater intrusion into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida (USA),"Xiao, H.; Tang, Y.","Saltwater intrusion into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida (USA) due to the effects of storm surges from tropical cyclones and continuous sea-level rise is a detrimental issue resulting in groundwater quality deterioration and bio-diverse ecosystem degradation. In this study, groundwater flow and salinity transport models using SEAWAT are developed for quantifying the âsuperposedâ effects of storm surge (SS) from a Category 3 hurricane (Hurricane Jeanne which hit the Florida Atlantic coast on September 24â27, 2004) and continuous sea-level rise (SLR) on saltwater intrusion (SWI) into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida from the year of 2004 to 2024, and the simulated time-variant extent of SS- and SLR-induced landward migration of saline groundwater is compared for determination of whether the effects of SS from a Category 3 hurricane or continuous SLR on SWI are more significant. Results indicate that (1) the effects of SS are more significant than the effects of SLR within the first 12, 10, or 9Â years after its occurrence date if sea level rises in low, mid, or high rate; (2) the effects of SS are more significant than the effects of SLR if SS occurs at least once within its return period (8â12Â years); and (3) the maximum effects of SS are âequivalentâ to the effects of the 95-year SLR, 45-year SLR, or 28-year SLR if sea level rises to 0.3Â m in low, mid, or high rate.

"Modeling Floodplain Inundation, Circulation, and Residence Time Under Changing Tide and Sea Levels","Sullivan, J.C.; Wan, Y.; Willis, R.A.","Sea-level rise will have unknown effects on the structure and function of valuable tidal freshwater floodplains. One reason for this knowledge gap is our poor constraint on the physical controls on complex floodplain inundation and circulation processes. Here, a high-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) digital elevation model (DEM) is applied to fine-scale numerical simulations of flow and tracer exchange in a 0.43Â km2 river floodplain in Southeast Florida, USA. The sequence of inundation and associated circulation patterns is assessed at 1-h intervals of the rising and falling tide in the context of floodplain geomorphic structure. The depth averaged velocity vectors show concomitant flow divergence and convergence over small spatial scales, and this complexity arises from the submergence and emergence of subtle floodplain topography over the tidal cycle. Tracer exchange and associated residence times highlight the controls of floodplain topography on water storage at the end of the ebb cycle, or during low river stages. The effects of a 0.2Â m and 0.5Â m increase in mean sea level on inundation extent and water retention times were also assessed. Percent change in inundated area and associated e-folding times reveal greater lateral inundation extent and a 20% increase in water retention times with up to a 0.5Â m increase in mean sea level. This work reveals the topographic influence on how, when, and where sea level rise will impact the freshwater floodplain through increased hydro period and saltwater intrusion, and the importance of evaluating floodplain restoration benefits in the context of fine-scale surface flow processes and sea-level rise.

Rapid Land Cover Change in a Submerging Coastal County,"Gedan, K.B.; Epanchin-Niell, R.; Qi, M.","Sea level rise is reshaping the coasts, allowing coastal habitats such as tidal marshes to migrate inland. To predict where changes will occur, it is critical to understand the factors that influence land cover transition. Here, we test the influence of land cover type on land cover transition. We hypothesized that marsh migration may vary by upland land cover type, due to dominant plant speciesâ differences in salinity and inundation tolerance. Additionally, the response of people may make specific land cover types more likely to be protected from transition. We measured land cover change in high resolution aerial imagery over the relatively short period of 2009 to 2017 in coastal Somerset County, Maryland. In logistic models of land cover transition, we found that âagricultural landâ and âscrub shrub wetland / forested wetlandâ cover classes were more likely to transition to âemergent wetlandâ than âforest/scrub shrubâ or âurban or built-up landâ cover classes, after controlling for elevation and distance to shore, two well-known predictors of marsh migration. Over only 8Â years, loss of upland area in the county totaled 6.1Â km2, of which 5.7Â km2 was agricultural land.

Biophysical controls of marsh soil shear strength along an estuarine salinity gradient,"Gillen, M.N.; Messerschmidt, T.C.; Kirwan, M.L.","Sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and wave erosion threaten coastal marshes, but the influence of salinity on marsh erodibility remains poorly understood. We measured the shear strength of marsh soils along a salinity and biodiversity gradient in the York River estuary in Virginia to assess the direct and indirect impacts of salinity on potential marsh erodibility. We found that soil shear strength was higher in monospecific salt marshes (5-36 kPa) than in biodiverse freshwater marshes (4-8 kPa), likely driven by differences in belowground biomass. However, we also found that shear strength at the marsh edge was controlled by sediment characteristics, rather than vegetation or salinity, suggesting that inherent relationships may be obscured in more dynamic environments. Our results indicate that York River freshwater marsh soils are weaker than salt marsh soils, and suggest that salinization of these freshwater marshes may lead to simultaneous losses in biodiversity and erodibility.

Here we model a range of sea-level rise scenarios to assess the responses of water tables across the diverse topography and climates of the California coast. With 1 m of sea-level rise, areas flooded from below are predicted to expand ~50â130 m inland, and low-lying coastal communities such as those around San Francisco Bay are most at risk. Coastal topography is a controlling factor; long-term rising water tables will intercept low-elevation drainage features, allowing for groundwater discharge that damps the extent of shoaling in ~70% (68.9â82.2%) of Californiaâs coastal water tables. Ignoring these topography-limited responses increases flooded-area forecasts by ~20% and substantially underestimates saltwater intrusion. All scenarios estimate that areas with shallow coastal water tables will shrink as they are inundated by overland flooding or are topographically limited from rising inland.

Mitigation of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using coastal earth fill considering future sea level rise,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Abd-Elaty, I.; Hussain, M.S.","Saltwater intrusion (SWI) is a physical problem that threatens many coastal aquifers all over the world. Saltwater intrusion is increasing with abstraction and rise in sea level. Coastal aquifer protection is essential to protect groundwater resources in these areas. A number of methods have been developed to protect coastal aquifers from SWI. This paper presents the impact of sea level rise on SWI in coastal aquifers and application of coastal earth fill as a new technique to control SWI. Different future sea level rise scenarios were studied and different coastal earth fill with an appropriate soil to extend the coastline towards the sea in order to control SWI was studied using SEAWAT model. The proposed control measure is numerically assessed by Henryâs problem and then applied to a real case study of Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. For each aquifer, the corresponding relation was developed between the intrusion length of saltwater wedge and the width of fill. The results showed that increasing the fill width resulted in decreasing the intrusion length. In the case of Biscayne aquifer, increasing the fill width by 10, 20, 30, and 40% of the aquifer length resulted in retarding the intrusion to 329, 192, 42, and â 48Â m respectively. Using 150- and 300-m fill widths retards the intrusion length by 32.3% and 60.5%. In addition, increasing the fill width to 465Â m can retard SWI by 91.3%. This approach is capable to control the future risks of SWI and sea level rise. Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Environ. Sci. Pollut.

Chronic but not acute saltwater intrusion leads to large release of inorganic N in a tidal freshwater marsh,"Widney, S.E.; Smith, D.; Herbert, E.R.; Schubauer-Berigan, J.P.; Li, F.; Pennings, S.C.; Craft, C.B.","Sea level rise is expected to increase inundation and saltwater intrusion into many tidal freshwater marshes and forests. Saltwater intrusion may be long-term, as with rising seas, or episodic, as with low river flow or storm surge. We applied continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments of dilute seawater to replicate 2.5 Ã 2.5 m field plots for three years and measured soil attributes, including soil porewater, oxidation-reduction potential, soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) to investigate the effects of continuous and episodic saltwater intrusion and increased inundation on tidal freshwater marsh elemental cycling and soil processes. Continuous additions of dilute seawater resulted in increased porewater chloride, sulfate, sulfide, ammonium, and nitrate concentrations. Plots that received press additions also had lower soil oxidation-reduction potentials beginning in the second year. Episodic additions of dilute seawater during typical low flow conditions (Sept.-Oct.) resulted in transient increases in porewater chloride and sulfate that returned to baseline conditions once dosing ceased. Freshwater additions did not affect porewater inorganic N or soil C or N. Persistent saltwater intrusion in freshwater marshes alters the N cycle by releasing ammonium-N from sorption sites, increasing nitrification and severely reducing N storage in macrophyte biomass. Chronic saltwater intrusion, as is expected with rising seas, is likely to shift tidal freshwater marshes from a sink to a source of N whereas intermittent intrusion from drought may have no long term effect on N cycling.

Blue Crab Abundance and Survival in a Fragmenting Coastal Marsh System,"Shakeri, L.M.; Darnell, K.M.; Carruthers, T.J.B.; Darnell, M.Z.","Louisianaâs coastal marshes are becoming increasingly fragmented due to sea level rise, subsidence, reduced sediment inflow from the Mississippi River, and saltwater intrusion. Many commercially and recreationally fished species rely on the marsh system as nursery habitat, and the resilience of species to further marsh loss and marsh fragmentation is uncertain. We examined the impacts of marsh fragmentation on the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, a species supporting one of the largest fisheries in coastal LouisianaÂ and which uses marsh edge as nursery habitat. Juvenile and adult abundances were quantified in multiple habitats (bare sediment, marsh edge, and submerged aquatic vegetation [SAV]) within an actively fragmenting coastal marsh. Adult blue crabs were sampled using crab pots, while juveniles were sampled using a throw trap. In general, blue crab density was unrelated to marsh fragmentation, but was instead related to local-scale patterns of habitat availability, including presence and type of vegetation. In tethering experiments to examine predation rates on juvenile blue crabs across habitats, predation rates were lowest in SAV compared with marsh edge or bare sediment. While direct effects of marsh fragmentation on local-scale patterns of blue crab abundance were not observed, marsh fragmentation will likely have indirect effects on blue crab populations through changes in habitat availability. Unless SAV expands into newly created open water areas, providing an alternative nursery habitat for blue crabs, continued marsh fragmentation and loss are expected to have negative impacts on blue crab populations and fisheries through a decrease in available nursery habitat.

Addressing Sea Level Rise from the Ground Up: Understanding the Implications for Coastal Geotechnics,"Burke-Flask, A.; Stark, N.; Rodriguez-Marek, A.","One of the most critical climate change processes affecting coastal areas is sea level rise. In addition to inundating low-lying areas near the coast and increasing the frequency of flooding, sea level rise may raise the groundwater table, drive saltwater intrusion, and increase the risk for erosion and scour. These impacts represent key equilibrium shifts that will affect geotechnical site conditions and design parameters. Frequent inundation will likely increase the demand for floodable, elevated, and floating foundation systems; frequent flooding of roads may reduce the service life of pavements and erode unbound subgrade material. Groundwater rise will increase hydrostatic pressures on earth retaining structures and foundations and may complicate construction projects requiring excavation. The threat of saltwater intrusion will encourage innovative strategies for developing hydraulic barriers. Increased erosion may reduce the longevity of beach nourishment projects and increase the rate of scour around infrastructure. This paper expands on the implications of sea level rise listed above and provides an outlook on how sea level rise might impact future projects and drive trends in coastal geotechnical practice.

Gross nitrogen transformation rates in semiarid tropical soils under different salinity and vegetation conditions,"Sharma, N.; Kumar, S.","Exacerbated inundations and saltwater intrusions due to sea-level rise can significantly alter the ecology of low-lying coastal drylands by affecting their nutrient cycling and productivity. During the present study, controls on production and consumption of nitrogen in soils of semiarid tropical climate with different levels of vegetationâsalinityâmoisture condition were investigated using 15N isotope dilution experiments. For this purpose, soils were collected from five land types including two in salt flat and one each in grassland (GL), wetland (WL), and an agricultural field. Soils with no vegetation, high salinity, and high moisture (salt flats) showed significant decline in gross production of nitrogen (mineralization rate: 0.21Â Â±Â 0.10Â mg NÂ·kgâ1Â·dâ1; nitrification rate: 0.27Â Â±Â 0.17Â mg NÂ·kgâ1Â·dâ1) compared to soils with vegetation, low salinity, and low moisture (GL, WL, and agricultural) (mineralization rate: 2.47Â Â±Â 1.74Â mg NÂ·kgâ1Â·dâ1; nitrification rate: 1.43Â Â±Â 1.30Â mg NÂ·kgâ1Â·dâ1). Backward stepwise regression analysis of the results indicated salinity to be the most important factor controlling nitrogen transformation rates. It is likely that soils undergoing frequent seawater exposure or excessive evaporation may experience slowdown in nitrogen cycling due to salinization leading to reduced nutrient production and consumption. Due to climate change, the areal extent of coastal drylands undergoing such decline in nutrient production is likely to increase, eventually leading to loss of productivity and desertification.

Public priorities on locally-driven sea level rise planning on the East Coast of the United States,"Carpenter, A.T.","Sea level rise poses a substantial concern to communities worldwide. Increased inundation, storm surge, saltwater intrusion, and other impacts create challenges which will require considerable planning to address. Recognizing the broad and differing scope of sea level rise issues and the variability of policy options to address them, local planning frameworks are necessary in addition to tools and resources available from state and federal governments. To help assess priorities and preferences on sea level rise planning, a survey of 503 persons affiliated with coastal communities on the East Coast of the United States was conducted in December 2017. This survey studied key aspects locally-driven sea level rise plans, including planning priorities, funding options, methods to resolve conflict, and potential responses. Six key findings address these and other concerns to provide the foundation of a locally driven framework for public officials.

Impact of sea level rise on saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Estuary,"Huang, G.-W.; Kuang, C.-P.; Gu, J.; Huang, H.-C.","A two-dimensional hydrodynamic and salinity transport mathematical model of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) is established based on MIKE21. The mathematical model, which is verified well by the measured tidal level, velocity and salinity data, is used to simulate the change of salinity distribution in the dry season of PRE when sea level rise (SLR) by 0.5 m, 1m and 2 m, and to explore the response of saltwater intrusion to sea level rise. The numerical results show that the salinity of the PRE during the spring tide in the dry season generally increases with the SLR, but the salinity change distributions in different branches of the estuary are different. The isohalines are relative dense, i.e., the salinity gradient is larger, in Modaomen at the flood slack and in Modaomen and Hongqimen at the ebb slack. With 0.5 m, 1m and 2m SLR, the maximum salinity increases in Modaomen are 1.8 ppt, 3.6 ppt and 7.2 ppt respectively at the flood slack, and 2.2 ppt, 4.8 ppt and 9.6 ppt respectively at the ebb slack, i.e., the higher of SLR is, the larger of salinity increase is.

"Effects of Marsh Migration on Flooding, Saltwater Intrusion, and Crop Yield in Coastal Agricultural Land Subject to Storm Surge Inundation","Guimond, J.A.; Michael, H.A.","Low-lying coastlines are vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surge salinization, threatening the sustainability of coastal farmland. Most crops are intolerant of salinity, and minimization of saltwater intrusion is critical to crop preservation. Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including attenuation of storm surges. However, most research studying coastal protection by marshes neglects consideration of subsurface salinization. Here, we use two-dimensional, variable-density, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological models to explore how coastal wetlands affect surface and subsurface salinization due to storm surges. We evaluate how marsh width, surge height, and upland slope impact the magnitude of saltwater intrusion and the effect of marsh migration into farmland on crop yield. Results suggest that along topographically low coastlines subject to storm surges, marsh migration into agricultural fields prolongs the use of fields landward of the marsh while also protecting groundwater quality. Under a storm surge height of 3.0Â m above mean sea level or higher and terrestrial slope of 0.1%, marsh migration of 200 and 400Â m protects agricultural yield landward of the marsh-farmland interface compared to scenarios without migration, despite the loss of arable land. Economic calculations show that the maintained yields with 200Â m of marsh migration may benefit farmers financially. However, yields are not maintained with migration widths over 400Â m or surge height under 3.0Â m above mean sea level. Results highlight the environmental and economic benefits of marsh migration and the need for more robust compensation programs for landowners incorporating coastal wetland development as a management strategy.

A markov decision process model for socio-economic systems impacted by climate change,"Shuvo, S.S.; Yilmaz, Y.; Bush, A.; Hafen, M.","Coastal communities are at high risk of natural hazards due to unremitting global warming and sea level rise. Both the catastrophic impacts, e.g., tidal flooding and storm surges, and the long-term impacts, e.g., beach erosion, inundation of low lying areas, and saltwater intrusion into aquifers, cause economic, social, and ecological losses. Creating policies through appropriate modeling of the responses of stakeholders, such as government, businesses, and residents, to climate change and sea level rise scenarios can help to reduce these losses. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for an agent (government) which interacts with the environment (nature and residents) to deal with the impacts of climate change, in particular sea level rise. Through theoretical analysis we show that a reasonable government's policy on infrastructure development ought to be proactive and based on detected sea levels in order to minimize the expected total cost, as opposed to a straightforward government that reacts to observed costs from nature. We also provide a deep reinforcement learning-based scenario planning tool considering different government and resident types in terms of cooperation, and different sea level rise projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Impact Assessment and Management Challenges of Key Rural Human Health Infrastructure Under Sea Level Rise,"Mitchell, M.; Isdell, R.E.; Herman, J.; Tombleson, C.","Accelerating sea level rise in Virginia, United States, will significantly increase the flooding threat to low-lying roads, residences, and critical infrastructure as well as raise the water table, allowing saltwater intrusion into well water and threatening the function of septic fields. Although most of the adaptation work in Virginia has focused on urban economic centers, the majority of the coastline is rural and faces different threats and opportunities to address them compared to urban areas due to their reduced economic assets and their reliance on private infrastructure. In this case study, we assess the potential for geospatially quantifying impact to septic systems and adjacent water ways due to sea level rise. The case study found that the data necessary to reliably quantify these impacts on a state-wide scale are lacking and collection of that information needs to be prioritized given the potential for extensive sea level impacts.

Modeling Soil Porewater Salinity Response to Drought in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands,"Wang, H.; Krauss, K.W.; Noe, G.B.; Stagg, C.L.; Swarzenski, C.M.; Duberstein, J.A.; Conner, W.H.; DeAngelis, D.L.","There is a growing concern about the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion via tidal rivers, streams, and creeks into tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) due to sea level rise (SLR) and intense and extended drought events. However, the magnitude and duration of porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 practical salinity units, psu) and the controlling factors remain unclear. In this study, we developed a TFFW soil porewater salinity model, in which the feedback mechanisms between soil salinity and evapotranspiration and hydraulic conductivity were incorporated. We selected sites (upper, middle, lower tidal freshwater forest sites, and oligohaline marsh site) along the coastal floodplains of two rivers, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA), that represent landscape salinity gradients from tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold.

Seeds of change: Characterizing the soil seed bank of a migrating salt marsh,"Kottler, E.J.; Gedan, K.","â¢ Background and Aims The capacity for dispersal to promote or hinder speciesâ responses to global change remains a major question in ecology. One ecosystem experiencing rapid change is the tidal marsh, which is migrating inland in response to accelerated sea level rise. Few studies to date have investigated the ecological dynamics that impact this large-scale migration. Seed dispersal and persistence in the soil seed bank is a component that can be strongly indicative of community trajectories. With this in mind, the aim of our study was to characterize the germinable seed bank across a marshâforest ecotone in the Chesapeake Bay. â¢ Methods Soil samples were collected across transects that ran from the high marsh to the coastal loblolly pine forest in a brackish marsh in Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, MD, USA. Samples were grown in a greenhouse and watered with either freshwater or 3 ppt seawater solution. We compared community composition across transects and between salinity treatments. Additionally, we compared the seed bank with standing vegetation and used seed trait data from the TRY Database to investigate changes in functional traits along this ecotone. â¢ Key Results We found halophytic species dispersing up to 15 m into the forest and a general lack of obligate upland species, including near absence of Pinus taeda, the dominant species in the forest canopy. A majority of species detected in the seed bank were wetland species of various types, with species with wide salinity tolerance arising most frequently. Salinity addition had a significant negative influence on seed bank diversity. â¢ Conclusion Overall, our seed bank results suggest that dispersal and germination under the conditions of saltwater intrusion will limit forest regeneration and favour marsh plant dispersal. This indicates that the ecological processes that determine the soil seed bank community will support continued migration of marsh species into uplands. Â© The Author(s) 2019.

Towards a correlation between long-term seawater intrusion response and water level fluctuations,"Abdoulhalik, A.; Ahmed, A.A.; Abdelgawad, A.M.; Hamill, G.A.","Laboratory and numerical experiments were conducted to provide a quantitative steadystate analysis of the effect of incremental variations of water level on saltwater intrusion. The purpose was to seek mathematical correlations relating both the wedge toe length and the height along the coastline to the boundary head difference. The laboratory experiments were completed in a 2D sand tank where both freshwater and seawater levels were varied. The experiments were conducted for two bead sizes having different hydraulic conductivities. The numerical model SEAWAT was used to validate the results and then to perform sensitivity analysis. The experimental results show that at steady-state conditions, the logarithmic toe length could be expressed as a linear function of the boundary head difference. The linear relationship was recorded in both advancing and receding wedge phases. The linearity of the correlation was also well demonstrated with analytical solutions. Similar relationships were also derived in the scenarios where the sea level fluctuated while the freshwater boundary head was constant. The height of the saltwater wedge along the coastline was also found to be a linear function of the boundary head difference. The sensitivity analysis shows that the regression coefficients were sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity, the dispersivity, and the saltwater density, while the porosity and the rate of boundary head change induced negligible effects. The existence of a linear relationship between the logarithmic toe length and the boundary head difference was also well evidenced in a field-scale aquifer model for all the different hydrogeological aquifer conditions tested. This study is the first attempt in identifying the underlying correlation between the boundary water level variations and the main seawater intrusion (SWI) external metrics under controlled laboratory conditions, which is of great relevance from a water resources management perspective.

Changes in Physical Properties of Everglades Peat Soils Induced by Increased Salinity at the Laboratory Scale: Implications for Changes in Biogenic Gas Dynamics,"Sirianni, M.J.; Comas, X.","Saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise is a major concern for the Florida Everglades because it may induce shifts in ecosystem productivity and physical soil properties. However, the effects of saline water intrusion into the current carbon gas dynamics of the Everglades (particularly in terms of biogenic gas production and emissions, i.e., CH4 and CO2) are still uncertain. In this work, we present a laboratory-based study to simulate how sea level rise may alter the physical properties (i.e., hydraulic conductivity) of peat soils from the Everglades and consequently affect the accumulation and release of biogenic gases within the peat matrix. Peat monoliths collected from the Everglades were subjected to progressive increases in salinity from a NaCl solution, and changes to the biogenic gas dynamics regime were simultaneously monitored using a combination of time-lapse ground-penetrating radar measurements, manometers, time-lapse photography, and gas traps. Physical changes to the peat matrix at each salinity interval were assessed using constant head permeameter tests. Consistent with previous research, results show that a progressive increase in salinity (from fresh to saltwater) results in (1) a progressive increase in hydraulic conductivity and (2) a progressive decrease in gas content within the peat matrix (i.e., production) and gas releases. This work has implications for better understanding the potential effects of saltwater intrusion into freshwater peatland systems in the Everglades, particularly in terms of carbon gas dynamics.

Identifying the effects of chronic saltwater intrusion in coastal floodplain swamps using remote sensing,"White, E.; Kaplan, D.","Coastal floodplain swamps (CFS) are an important part of the coastal wetland mosaic, however they are threatened due to accelerated rates of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion (SWI). While remote sensing-based detection of wholesale coastal ecosystem shifts (i.e., from forest to marsh) are relatively straightforward, assessments of chronic, low-level SWI into CFS using remote sensing have yet to be developed and can provide a critical early-warning signal of ecosystem deterioration. In this study, we developed nine ecologically-based hypotheses to test whether remote sensing data could be used to reliably detect the presence of CFS experiencing SWI. Hypotheses were motivated by field- and literature-based understanding of the phenological and vegetative dynamics of CFS experiencing SWI relative to unimpacted, control systems. Hypotheses were organized into two primary groups: those that analyzed differences in summary measures (e.g., median and distribution) between SWI-impacted and unimpacted control sites and those that examined timeseries trends (e.g., sign and magnitude of slope). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a proxy for production/biomass and was generated using MODIS surface reflectance data spanning 2000 to 2018. Experimental sites (n = 8) were selected from an existing network of long-term monitoring sites and included 4 pairs of impacted/non-impacted CFS across the northern Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The four best-supported hypotheses (81% across all sties) all used summary statistics, indicating that there were significant differences in the EVI of CFS experiencing chronic, low-level SWI compared to controls. These hypotheses were tested using data across a large and diverse region, supporting their implementation by researchers and managers seeking to identify CFS undergoing the first phases of SWI. In contrast, hypotheses that assessed CFS change over time were poorly supported, likely due to the slow and variable pace of ecological change, relatively short remote sensing data record, and/or specific site histories. Overall, these results show that remote sensing data can be used to identify differences in CFS vegetation associated with long-term, low-level SWI, but further methodological advancements are needed to reliably detect the temporal transition process.

Physical modelling approach for assessing the effect of climate change on groundwater at coastal area,"Raksmey, M.; Hamid, S.A.S.","Seawater intrusion has brought a great deal of attention globally with the worsening effect of rising sea level and changing of climates. Global climate change which has caused the unevenness increased in extreme events such as droughts and floods has anticipated water resources to become impaired. In this study, under the influence of climate change, a shallow unconfined groundwater was laid out orderly to investigate the saltwater intrusion phenomena in coastal aquifers. Experiments were conducted using laboratory rectangular model tank filled with fresh water, well-sorted sand and salt water into three separate chambers. In spite of the fact that numerous experimental procedures have been acquired to investigate the transient development of the saltwater interface in unconfined aquifers, none of them has tackled the possibilities of applying the climate change effect. The main focus of this particular investigation is to compare the relation of recharge and rising of sea level on the behaviour of the saltwater interface in the unconfined aquifer from laboratory experiment with the normal cases of flood and the sea level rise as well as the drought and sea level rise. Simulation on the projected rising of sea level due to the climate change leads to significant intrusion outcomes of 52.4% with a toe of the saltwater wedge (TOE) distance of 0.54 m; however, an increase in the magnitude of precipitation rates and freshwater head can ultimately recharge the groundwater. This mitigates the changes of 49% in the saltwater-freshwater interface (SFI) with a receding distance of 0.22 m. Â© 2021, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

A system-of-systems framework for exploratory analysis of climate change impacts on civil infrastructure resilience,"Mostafavi, A.","Climate change has various chronic and acute impacts on civil infrastructure systems (CIS). A long-term assessment of resilience in CIS requires understanding the transformation of CIS caused by climate change stressors and adaptation decision-making behaviors of institutional agencies. In addition, resilience assessment for CIS includes significant uncertainty regarding future climate change scenarios and subsequent impacts. Thus, resilience analysis in CIS under climate change impacts need to capture complex adaptive behaviors and uncertainty in order to enable robust planning and decision-making. This paper presents a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for abstraction and integrated modeling of climate change stressors, physical infrastructure performance, and institutional actorsâ decision-making processes. The application of the proposed SoS framework is shown in an illustrative example related to the impacts of sea level rise and subsequent saltwater intrusion on a water system. Through the use of the proposed SoS framework, various attributes, processes, and interactions related to physical infrastructure and actorâs decision-making were abstracted and used in the creation of a computational simulation model. Then, the computational model was used to simulate various scenarios composed of sea level rise and adaptation approaches. Through an exploratory analysis approach, the simulated scenario landscape was used to identify robust adaptation pathways that lead to a greater system resilience under future uncertain sea level rise. The results of the illustrative example highlight the various novel capabilities of the SoS framework: (i) abstraction of various attributes and processes that affect the long-term resilience of infrastructure under climate change; (ii) integrated modeling of CIS transformation based on simulating the adaptive decision-making processes, physical infrastructure performance, and climate change impacts; and (iii) exploratory analysis and identification of robust pathways for adaptation to climate change impacts.

Impacts of increasing salinity and inundation on rates and pathways of organic carbon mineralization in tidal wetlands: a review,"Luo, M.; Huang, J.-F.; Zhu, W.-F.; Tong, C.","To improve our understanding of the carbon cycling response to imminent sea-level rise and saltwater intrusions, we review the existing literature on the likely effects of the increasing salinity and inundation on organic carbon mineralization in tidal wetlands. Enhanced salinity and inundation will reduce the pool of the organic carbon substrate, but may expand that of microbes with strong capacities for carbon metabolism. Sulfate availability increases with the increasing salinity, while availability of other electron acceptors, e.g., oxygen, nitrate, ferric oxides, and carbon dioxide, could transiently increase but would ultimately fall with the increasing salinity and inundation. The changing electron acceptor pattern may result in microbial sulfate reduction predominating over other carbon mineralization pathways. Data derived from natural salinity and inundation gradients suggest clear negative effects of salinity and inundation on production rates or emission fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane. However, results for brackish wetlands are conflicting, probably due to their unique geographic location. Salinity and inundation exert their influence on organic carbon mineralization through sulfate enrichment, elevating ionic and osmotic stress and decreasing oxygen concentrations and redox conditions, among other biogeochemical changes. Future studies should address the combined effects of salinity and inundation on carbon biogeochemistry in low-level salinity tidal wetlands.

Declines in Plant Productivity Drive Carbon Loss from Brackish Coastal Wetland Mesocosms Exposed to Saltwater Intrusion,"Wilson, B.J.; Servais, S.; Charles, S.P.; Davis, S.E.; Gaiser, E.E.; Kominoski, J.S.; Richards, J.H.; Troxler, T.G.","Coastal wetlands, among the most productive ecosystems, are important global reservoirs of carbon (C). Accelerated sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands increase salinity and inundation depth, causing uncertain effects on plant and soil processes that drive C storage. We exposed peat-soil monoliths with sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) plants from a brackish marsh to continuous treatments of salinity (elevated (~ 20Â ppt) vs. ambient (~ 10Â ppt)) and inundation levels (submerged (water above soil surface) vs. exposed (water level 4Â cm below soil surface)) for 18Â months. We quantified changes in soil biogeochemistry, plant productivity, and whole-ecosystem C flux (gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; ecosystem respiration, ER). Elevated salinity had no effect on soil CO2 and CH4 efflux, but it reduced ER and GEP by 42 and 72%, respectively. Control monoliths exposed to ambient salinity had greater net ecosystem productivity (NEP), storing up to nine times more C than plants and soils exposed to elevated salinity. Submersion suppressed soil CO2 efflux but had no effect on NEP. Decreased plant productivity and soil organic C inputs with saltwater intrusion are likely mechanisms of net declines in soil C storage, which may affect the ability of coastal peat marshes to adapt to rising seas.

"Forest composition and growth in a freshwater forested wetland community across a salinity gradient in South Carolina, USA","Liu, X.; Conner, W.H.; Song, B.; Jayakaran, A.D.","Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) of the southeastern United States are experiencing increased saltwater intrusion mainly due to sea-level rise. Inter-annual and intra-annual variability in forest productivity along a salinity gradient was studied on established sites. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of trees was monitored from 2013 to 2015 on three sites within a baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) swamp forest ecosystem in Strawberry Swamp on Hobcaw Barony, Georgetown County, South Carolina. Paired plots (20 Ã 25-m) were established along a water salinity gradient (0.8, 2.6, 4.6 PSU). Salinity was continuously monitored, litterfall was measured monthly, and growth of overstory trees â©¾10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) was monitored on an annual basis. Annual litterfall and stem wood growth were summed to estimate ANPP. The DBH of live and dead individuals of understory shrubs were measured to calculate density, basal area (BA), and important values (IV). Freshwater forest communities clearly differed in composition, structure, tree size, BA, and productivity across the salinity gradient. The higher salinity plots had decreased numbers of tree species, density, and BA. Higher salinity reduced average ANPP. The dominant tree species and their relative densities did not change along the salinity gradient, but the dominance of the primary tree species differed with increasing salinity. Baldcypress was the predominant tree species with highest density, DBH, BA, IV, and contribution to total ANPP on all sites. Mean growth rate of baldcypress trees decreased with increasing salinity, but exhibited the greatest growth among all tree species. While the overall number of shrub species decreased with increasing salinity, wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) density, DBH, BA, and IV increased with salinity. With rising sea level and increasing salinity levels, low regeneration of baldcypress, and the invasion of wax myrtle, typical successional patterns in TFFW and forest health are likely to change in the future.

Salinity pulses interact with seasonal dry-down to increase ecosystem carbon loss in marshes of the Florida Everglades,"Wilson, B.J.; Servais, S.; Mazzei, V.; Kominoski, J.S.; Hu, M.; Davis, S.E.; Gaiser, E.; Sklar, F.; Bauman, L.; Kelly, S.; Madden, C.; Richards, J.; Rudnick, D.; Stachelek, J.; Troxler, T.G.","Coastal wetlands are globally important sinks of organic carbon (C). However, to what extent wetland C cycling will be affected by accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion is unknown, especially in coastal peat marshes where water flow is highly managed. Our objective was to determine how the ecosystem C balance in coastal peat marshes is influenced by elevated salinity. For two years, we made monthly inÂ situ manipulations of elevated salinity in freshwater (FW) and brackish water (BW) sites within Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. Salinity pulses interacted with marsh-specific variability in seasonal hydroperiods whereby effects of elevated pulsed salinity on gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were dependent on marsh inundation level. We found little effect of elevated salinity on C cycling when both marsh sites were inundated, but when water levels receded below the soil surface, the BW marsh shifted from a C sink to a C source. During these exposed periods, we observed an approximately threefold increase in CO2 efflux from the marsh as a result of elevated salinity. Initially, elevated salinity pulses did not affect Cladium jamaicense biomass, but aboveground biomass began to be significantly decreased in the saltwater amended plots after two years of exposure at the BW site. We found a 65% (FW) and 72% (BW) reduction in live root biomass in the soil after two years of exposure to elevated salinity pulses. Regardless of salinity treatment, the FW site was C neutral while the BW site was a strong C source (â334 to â454Â g CÂ·mâ2Â·yrâ1), particularly during dry-down events. A loss of live roots coupled with annual net CO2 losses as marshes transition from FW to BW likely contributes to the collapse of peat soils observed in the coastal Everglades. As SLR increases the rate of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands globally, understanding how water management influences C gains and losses from these systems is crucial. Under current Evergladesâ water management, drought lengthens marsh dry-down periods, which, coupled with saltwater intrusion, accelerates CO2 loss from the marsh.

"A Review of Water Quality Responses to Air Temperature and Precipitation Changes 1: Flow, Water Temperature, Saltwater Intrusion","Paul, M.J.; Coffey, R.; Stamp, J.; Johnson, T.","Anticipated future increases in air temperature and regionally variable changes in precipitation will have direct and cascading effects on United States (U.S.) water quality. In this paper, and a companion paper by Coffey etÂ al., we review technical literature addressing the responses of different water quality attributes to historical and potential future changes in air temperature and precipitation. The goal is to document how different attributes of water quality are sensitive to these drivers, to characterize future risk to inform management responses, and to identify research needs to fill gaps in our understanding. Here we focus on potential changes in streamflow, water temperature, and salt water intrusion (SWI). Projected changes in the volume and timing of streamflow vary regionally, with general increases in northern and eastern regions of the U.S., and decreases in the southern Plains, interior Southwest, and parts of the Southeast. Water temperatures have increased throughout the U.S. and are expected to continue to increase in the future, with the greatest changes in locations where high summer air temperatures occur together with low streamflow volumes. In coastal areas, especially the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts, SWI to rivers and aquifers could be exacerbated by sea level rise, storm surges, and altered freshwater runoff.

"The role of economic, policy, and ecological factors in estimating the value of carbon stocks in Everglades mangrove forests, South Florida, USA","Jerath, M.; Bhat, M.; Rivera-Monroy, V.H.; CastaÃ±eda-Moya, E.; Simard, M.; Twilley, R.R.","Old growth mangroves in existing protected areas store more carbon than restored forests or plantations. Carbon storage in such forests has economic value independent of additionality, offering opportunities for policy makers to ensure their maintenance, and inclusion in climate change mitigation strategies. Mangrove forests of the Everglades National Park (ENP), South Florida, though protected, face external stressors such as hydrological alterations because of flooding control structures and agriculture impacts and saltwater intrusion as a result of increasing sea level rise. Moreover, decreased funding of Evergladesâ restoration activities following the recent economic crisis (beginning 2008) threatens the restoration of the Greater Everglades including mangrove dominated coastal regions. We evaluate several economic and ecological challenges confronting the economic valuation of total (vegetation plus soil) organic carbon (TOC) storage in the ENP mangroves. Estimated TOC storage for this forested wetland ranges from 70 to 537 Mg C/ha and is higher than values reported for tropical, boreal, and temperate forests. We calculate the average abatement cost of C specific for ENP mangroves to value the TOC from $2â$3.4 billion; estimated unit area values are $13,859/haâ$23,728/ha. The valuation of the stored/legacy carbon is based on the: 1) ecogeomorphic attributes, 2) regional socio-economic milieu, and 3) status of the ENP mangroves as a protected area. The assessment of C storage estimates and its economic value can change public perception about how this regulating ecosystem service of ENP mangrove wetlands (144,447 ha) supports human well-being and numerous economic activities. This perception, in turn, can contribute to future policy changes such that the ENP mangroves, the largest mangrove area in the continental USA, can be included as a potential alternative in climate change mitigation strategies.

"Investigating effects of climate change, urbanization, and sea level changes on groundwater resources in a coastal aquifer: an integrated assessment","Akbarpour, S.; Niksokhan, M.H.","Urbanization and climate change are causing numerous side effects on groundwater resources. In this study, an integrated modeling approach by linking soil and water application tool (SWAT), modular finite difference groundwater flow (MODFLOW), and three-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow coupled with multi-species solute and heat transport (SEAWAT) models were used to exhibit responses of groundwater systems, in terms of flow and salt concentrations to current and future climatic and anthropogenic changes. Future climate scenarios for periods of 2010â2040 were generated from the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM) for scenarios A1B, B1, and A2 which was downscaled by the Long Ashton Research Station weather generator (LARS-WG) providing precipitation and temperature patterns for the period 2018â2040. The GCMâs outputs were applied to SWAT model to estimate recharge rate for the ten scenarios designed to assess the sensitivity of the aquifer to urbanization and climate change. The estimated recharge rate from SWAT was utilized as an input in numerical groundwater model to evaluate saltwater intrusion (SWI), changes in freshwater storage within the aquifer system, and changes in groundwater level. Based on the results of each scenarioâs simulation, increase of pumping rate yield by future population growth will have more adverse effects on the unconfined aquifer. The derived information from this study can be used to improve future works by developing a better understanding of the managed and unmanaged response of freshwater storage and unconfined groundwater systems to climate change and anthropogenic activities.

Increasing Methane Emissions From Natural Land Ecosystems due to Sea-Level Rise,"Lu, X.; Zhou, Y.; Zhuang, Q.; Prigent, C.; Liu, Y.; Teuling, A.","Atmospheric methane (CH4) is one of the most important greenhouse gases. However, there is still a large uncertainty in simulating CH4 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. Different from modeling studies focusing on response of CH4 emissions to various environmental changes in land ecosystems, this study analyzed the response of CH4 emissions to sea-level rise (SLR). To do so, a large-scale surface water routing module was incorporated into an existing CH4 model. This allowed the model to simulate the effect of SLR on river flows and inland water levels. This study focused on these freshwater systems and did not address saltwater intrusion or coastal wetland impacts. Both the annual maximum inundation extent and CH4 emissions at the global level showed a steadily growing trend, with an increase of 1.21Â ÃÂ 105Â km2 in extent and an increase of 3.13Â Tg CH4/year in CH4 emissions, in a 22-year SLR experiment from 1993 to 2014. Most of new inundation and methane source areas were located near rivers' deltas and along downstream reaches of rivers. The increase in the inundation extent is primarily influenced by precipitation, channel geomorphic characteristics, and topography of riverside area. The increase of CH4 emissions due to the SLR is largely determined by the inundation extent, but other factors such as air temperature and carbon storage also play roles. Although the current SLR-induced increases in the inundation extent and CH4 emissions only accounted for 1.0% and 1.3% of their global totals, these increases contributed 7.0% and 17.3% of the mean annual variability in both, respectively, during the study period. Considering that SLR has a long-term increasing trend, future SLR under a changing climate could play a more important role in global CH4 emissions. Â©2018. American Geophysical Union.

"âLiving on the edgeâ: Estimating the economic cost of sea level rise on coastal real estate in the Tampa Bay region, Florida","Fu, X.; Song, J.; Sun, B.; Peng, Z.-R.","Climate change and especially sea level rise are posing unprecedented pressure on coastal communities through enhanced coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion. Thus, adapting to its impacts has drawn global attention. Since the cost-efficiency of adaptation alternatives is crucial in decision making, accurately estimating the economic cost of sea level rise is an imperative task for coastal planners and managers. This study employed a spatial hedonic approach to estimate the economic cost due to inundation by future sea level rise. The applied methodology provides better estimates of the economic losses due to sea level rise by accounting for lost coastal amenities, and the results generated can also be utilized for cost-benefit analysis. In 2050, it is estimated that the inundation of 3-foot sea level rise could cost Hillsborough and Pinellas County over 300 and 900 million dollars respectively for the real estate marketÂ alone. Local coastal planners and managers may find this methodology useful in estimating the potential economic cost due to sea level rise and support making adaptation decisions. We also stressed the importance of such studies to support local decision making and enhance adaptation planning for the climate change and sea level rise in the coastal communities.

"Coastal adaptation, government-subsidized insurance, and perverse incentives to stay","Craig, R.K.","The law should be a critical tool in promoting and directing climate change adaptation in the USA. This should be particularly true in the nationâs extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion. However, significant coastal infrastructure hampers many coastal adaptation strategies by making retreat both expensive and politically unpalatable. This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes and is close to bankruptcy; Floridaâs decision to provide state-financed insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004â2005 hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation, including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.

Spatiotemporal distributions of sr and ba along an estuarine river with a large salinity gradient to the Gulf of Mexico,"He, S.; Xu, Y.J.","Strontium and barium to calcium ratios are often used as proxies for tracking animal movement across salinity gradients. Many estuarine rivers face saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise, potentially causing changes in mobility and distribution of these metals upstream. From May 2013 to August 2015, monthly water samples were collected and in-situ measurements were performed at six sites along an estuary strongly affected by saltwater intrusion, the Calcasieu River, with salinity ranging from 0.02 to 29.50 Parts Per Thousand (ppt). Results showed that the total Sr concentration and the Sr/Ca ratio both increased significantly with increasing salinity. The average Sr concentration at the site closest to the Gulf of Mexico (Site 6) was 46.21 Î¼mol/L, about 130 times higher than that of the site furthest upstream (Site 1, 0.35). The average Sr/Ca ratio at Site 6 (8.41 mmol/mol) was about three times the average Sr/Ca ratio at Site 1 (2.89). However, the spatial variation in total Ba concentration was marginal, varying from 0.36 to 0.47 Î¼mol/L. The average Ba/Ca ratio at Site 1 (4.82 mmol/mol) was about 54 times the ratio at Site 6 (0.09), showing a negative relation between the Ba/Ca ratio and salinity. All elemental concentrations and ratios had considerable seasonal variations, with significant differences among sampling months for the Sr and Ba concentrations and the Ba/Ca ratio (p < 0.01). The results suggest that for low-gradient estuarine rivers such as the Calcasieu River, water chemistry upstream would experience substantial Sr and Ca enrichment, potentially affecting aquatic environments and biological communities.

Changes in abundance and community structure of nitrate-reducing bacteria along a salinity gradient in tidal wetlands,"Franklin, R.B.; Morrissey, E.M.; Morina, J.C.","Primarily because of their high levels of microbiological activity, wetland soils play a key role in ameliorating nitrogen pollution and reducing nutrient loadings to coastal zones. Saltwater intrusion associated with climate change is expected to dramatically affect the biogeochemistry of these soils and induce changes in the composition of the soil microbial community that may alter their ability to process nitrogen. In this study, the abundance and community structure of microorganisms associated with two key nitrate removal pathways â denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) â were assessed for eight tidal wetlands along a naturally-occurring salinity gradient (0â2Â ppt) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (USA). Molecular analyses targeted functional genes specific for each pathway (denitrification: nirS and nosZ; DNRA: nrfA). Shifts in abundance and community structure of both groups of nitrate reducers were strongly coupled to changes in salinity, and correlation analyses suggested that the effect of salinity on these organisms may have been mediated, at least in part, by changes in soil organic matter availability. Considering the growing body of evidence that microbial community composition may help regulate ecosystem process rates, an increased understanding of how salinity affects nitrogen cycling microbial communities may help us better predict how wetland soil function will be affected by global change and issues such as sea level rise.

In situ simulation of sea-level rise impacts on coastal wetlands using a flow-through mesocosm approach,"Stachelek, J.; Kelly, S.P.; Sklar, F.H.; Coronado-Molina, C.; Troxler, T.; Bauman, L.","The impact of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal wetlands is dependent on the net effects of increased inundation and saltwater intrusion. The need for accurate projections of SLR impacts has motivated several experimental mesocosm studies aimed at detailed investigations on wetland biogeochemical cycling. However, the degree with which they accurately reproduce field conditions remains unknown because they have primarily been laboratory based using relatively small sediment volumes (10â200Â L) treated over short time periods. As a first step towards addressing these issues, we present a novel mesocosm device and portable methodology for long-term SLR simulation via in situ saltwater additions to relatively large sediment volumes (approximately 1,000Â L). The device (chamber) consists of two interlocking polycarbonate cylinders with an internal diameter of 1.4Â m. Each cylinder has holes drilled in the side to facilitate water exchange. The outer cylinder (collar) can be rotated to one of two possible positions. The first position produces alignment of the inner cylinder holes with the collar holes, whereas the second position offsets the holes to eliminate water exchange and contain salt additions (doses). Our device design and dosing scheme produced higher porewater salinities in the sediments of treatment mesocosms relative to control mesocosm sediments. In addition, we observed low incidence of elevated porewater salinity outside of the chamber walls and no measurable salt contamination of control plots. Widespread SLR simulations in a variety of geographical settings, whether with our proposed design or some other design, would likely help reduce some of the general uncertainties regarding the sensitivity of coastal wetlands to SLR and saltwater intrusion.

Vulnerability of forests of the Midwest and Northeast United States to climate change,"Swanston, C.; Brandt, L.A.; Janowiak, M.K.; Handler, S.D.; Butler-Leopold, P.; Iverson, L.; Thompson, F.R.; Ontl, T.A.; Shannon, P.D.","Forests of the Midwest and Northeast significantly define the character, culture, and economy of this large region but face an uncertain future as the climate continues to change. Forests vary widely across the region, and vulnerabilities are strongly influenced by regional differences in climate impacts and adaptive capacity. Not all forests are vulnerable; longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures will increase suitable habitat and biomass for many temperate species. Upland systems dominated by oak species generally have low vulnerability due to greater tolerance of hot and dry conditions, and some oak, hickory, and pine species are expected to become more competitive under hotter and physiologically drier conditions. However, changes in precipitation patterns, disturbance regimes, soil moisture, pest and disease outbreaks, and nonnative invasive species are expected to contribute forest vulnerability across the region. Northern, boreal, and montane forests have the greatest assessed vulnerability as many of their dominant tree species are projected to decline under warmer conditions. Coastal forests have high vulnerability, as sea level rise along the Atlantic coast increases damage from inundation, greater coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Considering these potential forest vulnerabilities and opportunities is a critical step in making climate-informed decisions in long-term conservation planning.

Rapid coastal forest decline in Florida's Big Bend,"McCarthy, M.J.; Dimmitt, B.; Muller-Karger, F.E.","Coastal ecosystems throughout the world are increasingly vulnerable to degradation as a result of accelerating sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion, more frequent and powerful extreme weather events, and anthropogenic impacts. Hardwood swamp forests in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast (USA) are largely devoid of the latter, but have degraded rapidly since the turn of the 21st Century. Photographs of the forest, collected on the ground since 2009, were used to guide an analysis of a 60 km2 study area using satellite images. The images confirm that the coastal forest area declined 0.60% from 1982 to 2003, but degraded rapidly, by 7.44%, from 2010 to 2017. The forest declined most rapidly along waterways and at the coastal marsh-forest boundary. Additional time series of aerial-photographs corroborated the onset of degradation in 2010. Degradation continued through 2017 with no apparent recovery. Previous research from the area has concluded that increased tidal flooding and saltwater intrusion, of the coastal plain, represent a chronic stress driving coastal forest decline in this region, but these drivers do not explain the abrupt acceleration in forest die-off. Local tide gage data indicate that sea-level rise is 2 mm yr-1 and accelerating, while meteorological data reveal at least two short-term cold snap events, with extreme temperatures exceeding the reported temperature threshold of local vegetation (-10 Â°C) between January 2010 and January 2011, followed by more extremes in 2016. The Big Bend hardwood forest experienced acute cold snap stress during the 2010-2017 period, of a magnitude not experienced in the previous 20 years, that compounded the chronic stress associated with sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. This and other coastal forests can be expected to suffer further widespread and lasting degradation as these stresses are likely to be sustained.

Salinity tolerances and use of saline environments by freshwater turtles: implications of sea level rise,"Agha, M.; Ennen, J.R.; Bower, D.S.; Nowakowski, A.J.; Sweat, S.C.; Todd, B.D.","The projected rise in global mean sea levels places many freshwater turtle species at risk of saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats. Freshwater turtles are disproportionately more threatened than other taxa; thus, understanding the role of salinity in determining their contemporary distribution and evolution should be a research priority. Freshwater turtles are a slowly evolving lineage; however, they can adapt physiologically or behaviourally to various levels of salinity and, therefore, temporarily occur in marine or brackish environments. Here, we provide the first comprehensive global review on freshwater turtle use and tolerance of brackish water ecosystems. We link together current knowledge of geographic occurrence, salinity tolerance, phylogenetic relationships, and physiological and behavioural mechanisms to generate a baseline understanding of the response of freshwater turtles to changing saline environments. We also review the potential origins of salinity tolerance in freshwater turtles. Finally, we integrate 2100 sea level rise (SLR) projections, species distribution maps, literature gathered on brackish water use, and a phylogeny to predict the exposure of freshwater turtles to projected SLR globally. From our synthesis of published literature and available data, we build a framework for spatial and phylogenetic conservation prioritization of coastal freshwater turtles. Based on our literature review, 70 species (â¼30% of coastal freshwater turtle species) from 10 of the 11 freshwater turtle families have been reported in brackish water ecosystems. Most anecdotal records, observations, and descriptions do not imply long-term salinity tolerance among freshwater turtles. Rather, experiments show that some species exhibit potential for adaptation and plasticity in physiological, behavioural, and life-history traits that enable them to endure varying periods (e.g. days or months) and levels of saltwater exposure. Species that specialize on brackish water habitats are likely to be vulnerable to SLR because of their exclusive coastal distributions and adaptations to a narrow range of salinities. Most species, however, have not been documented in brackish water habitats but may also be highly vulnerable to projected SLR. Our analysis suggests that approximately 90% of coastal freshwater turtle species assessed in our study will be affected by a 1-m increase in global mean SLR by 2100. Most at risk are freshwater turtles found in New Guinea, Southeast Asia, Australia, and North and South America that may lose more than 10% of their present geographic range. In addition, turtle species in the families Chelidae, Emydidae, and Trionychidae may experience the greatest exposure to projected SLR in their present geographic ranges. Better understanding of survival, growth, reproductive and population-level responses to SLR will improve region-specific population viability predictions of freshwater turtles that are increasingly exposed to SLR. Integrating phylogenetic, physiological, and spatial frameworks to assess the effects of projected SLR may improve identification of vulnerable species, guilds, and geographic regions in need of conservation prioritization. We conclude that the use of brackish and marine environments by freshwater turtles provides clues about the evolutionary processes that have prolonged their existence, shaped their unique coastal distributions, and may prove useful in predicting their response to a changing world.

The developed model is referred to as the âreferenceâ model and calibrated against field-measured groundwater levels and a map of land use and land cover. Then, five prediction/projection models are developed based on modification of the boundary conditions of the calibrated âreferenceâ model to quantify climate change impacts under various scenarios of sea-level rise and precipitation change projected to 2050. Model results indicate that west Merritt Island will encounter lowland inundation and saltwater intrusion due to its low elevation and flat topography, while climate change impacts on Cape Canaveral Island and east Merritt Island are not significant.

Can beaches survive climate change?,"Vitousek, S.; Barnard, P.L.; Limber, P.","Anthropogenic climate change is driving sea level rise, leading to numerous impacts on the coastal zone, such as increased coastal flooding, beach erosion, cliff failure, saltwater intrusion in aquifers, and groundwater inundation. Many beaches around the world are currently experiencing chronic erosion as a result of gradual, present-day rates of sea level rise (about 3Â mm/year) and human-driven restrictions in sand supply (e.g., harbor dredging and river damming). Accelerated sea level rise threatens to worsen coastal erosion and challenge the very existence of natural beaches throughout the world. Understanding and predicting the rates of sea level rise and coastal erosion depends on integrating data on natural systems with computer simulations. Although many computer modeling approaches are available to simulate shoreline change, few are capable of making reliable long-term predictions needed for full adaption or to enhance resilience. Recent advancements have allowed convincing decadal to centennial-scale predictions of shoreline evolution. For example, along 500Â km of the Southern California coast, a new model featuring data assimilation predicts that up to 67% of beaches may completely erode by 2100 without large-scale human interventions. In spite of recent advancements, coastal evolution models must continue to improve in their theoretical framework, quantification of accuracy and uncertainty, computational efficiency, predictive capability, and integration with observed data, in order to meet the scientific and engineering challenges produced by a changing climate.

Economic impacts of urban flooding in South Florida: Potential consequences of managing groundwater to prevent salt water intrusion,"Czajkowski, J.; Engel, V.; Martinez, C.; Mirchi, A.; Watkins, D.; Sukop, M.C.; Hughes, J.D.","High-value urban zones in coastal South Florida are considered particularly vulnerable to salt water intrusion into the groundwater-based, public water supplies caused by sea level rise (SLR) in combination with the low topography, existing high water table, and permeable karst substrate. Managers in the region closely regulate water depths in the extensive South Florida canal network to control closely coupled groundwater levels and thereby reduce the risk of saltwater intrusion into the karst aquifer. Potential SLR adaptation strategies developed by local managers suggest canal and groundwater levels may have to be increased over time to prevent the increased salt water intrusion risk to groundwater resources. However, higher canal and groundwater levels cause the loss of unsaturated zone storage and lead to an increased risk of inland flooding when the recharge from rainfall exceeds the capacity of the unsaturated zone to absorb it and the water table reaches the surface. Consequently, higher canal and groundwater levels are also associated with increased risk of economic losses, especially during the annual wet seasons. To help water managers and urban planners in this region better understand this trade-off, this study models the relationships between flood insurance claims and groundwater levels in Miami-Dade County. Via regression analyses, we relate the incurred number of monthly flood claims in 16 Miami-Dade County watersheds to monthly groundwater levels over the period from 1996 to 2010. We utilize these estimated statistical relationships to further illustrate various monthly flood loss scenarios that could plausibly result, thereby providing an economic quantification of a âtoo much waterâ trade-off. Importantly, this understanding is the first of its kind in South Florida and is exceedingly useful for regional-scale hydro-economic optimization models analyzing trade-offs associated with high water levels.

Visioning the Future: Scenarios Modeling of the Florida Coastal Everglades,"Flower, H.; Rains, M.; Fitz, C.","In this paper, we provide screening-level analysis of plausible Everglades ecosystem response by 2060 to sea level rise (0.50 m) interacting with macroclimate change (1.5 Â°C warming, 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and rainfall that either increases or decreases by 10%). We used these climate scenarios as input to the Ecological Landscape Model to simulate changes to seven interactive hydro-ecological metrics. Mangrove forest and other marine influences migrated up to 15 km inland in both scenarios, delineated by the saltwater front. Freshwater habitat area decreased by 25â30% under our two climate change scenarios and was largely replaced by mangroves and, in the increased rainfall scenario, open water as well. Significant mangroves drowned along northern Florida Bay in both climate change scenarios due to sea level rise. Increased rainfall of 10% provided significant benefits to the spatial and temporal salinity regime within the marine-influenced zone, providing a more gradual and natural adjustment for at-risk flora and fauna. However, increased rainfall also increased the risk of open water, due to water depths that inhibited mangrove establishment and reduced peat accumulation rates. We infer that ecological effects related to sea level rise may occur in the extreme front-edge of saltwater intrusion, that topography will control the incursion of this zone as sea level rises, and that differences in freshwater availability will have ecologically significant effects on ecosystem resilience through the temporal and spatial pattern of salinity changes.

Localized relative sea levels have been rising at elevated rates compared to global sea levels, and this trend will impact coastal plant communities, particularly wetlands. The Laguna Madre, a hypersaline lagoon, is home to nearly 80% of North America's redheads (Aythya americana) during winter. The large, shallow lagoon provides optimal growing conditions for seagrasses, including shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii), the redhead's primary winter food. Adjacent to the Laguna Madre are coastal ponds, on which redheads rely for fresh water. The close proximity of these freshwater sources to the coast makes them vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise. Using Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), we modeled the impacts of sea level rise on coastal ponds and foraging areas along the lower Texas coast through the year 2100. We also determined which coastal habitat types would be most affected by rising sea levels. The SLAMM model indicated that 9 land cover types had a â¥50% change in occurrence from the initial 1999 time period to 2100. The model also predicted that 93 of the known 156 coastal ponds would become inundated with salt water. The predicted loss of foraging habitat and its typical proximity to coastal ponds creates a need to identify where conservation and enhancement of wintering redhead habitat should be placed to mitigate the effects of sea level rise.

Quantification of Swell Energy and Its Impact on Wetlands in a Deltaic Estuary,"Everett, T.; Chen, Q.; Karimpour, A.; Twilley, R.","The extensive coastal wetlands in Mississippi River Delta represent the seventh largest deltaic floodplain in the world, contributing to many services that sustain the economies of the region. Subsidence, sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, wave action from storms, and sediment depletion have contributed to chronic wetland losses, converting vegetated lands into open waters and increasing wind fetch. Among these factors listed, wave energy plays the largest role in marsh edge erosion in an open bay environment. Degrading barrier islands along the shoreline of this delta allow swell energy to enter protected bay areas, contributing to marsh edge erosion. Locally generated wind waves within enlarged bays also contribute to wetland loss. Quantifying the roles of swell and wind waves in marsh edge erosion is essential to any ecosystem restoration design. In this study, a numerical model is implemented to describe the wave climate of combined swell and wind waves in a deltaic estuary. Terrebonne Bay was chosen as the study area because it has experienced one of the largest reductions in barrier islands and wetland loss rates among Louisiana estuaries. A continuous wave measurement in upper Terrebonne Bay was obtained over the course of a year. A spectral wave model is used to hindcast the wave climate in the estuary. The model results are compared against the in situ wave measurement. The wave power is partitioned into swell and wind sea at different locations in Terrebonne Bay using the model results. An extensive analysis on a valid effective wave power range that directly impacts the marsh edge is performed and presented. Insight into the temporal and spatial variability of wave power is gained. Through differentiating swell and wind sea energies around the bay, improvements of long-term wave power computation for shoreline retreat prediction are made. It is found that the swell energy becomes the primary driver of marsh edge retreat in the southwest part of Terrebonne Bay as the barrier islands are degrading. Â© 2018, The Author(s).",2019,,Estuar.

Assessing sea-level rise impact on saltwater intrusion into the root zone of a geo-typical area in coastal east-central Florida,"Xiao, H.; Wang, D.; Medeiros, S.C.; Hagen, S.C.; Hall, C.R.","Saltwater intrusion (SWI) into root zone in low-lying coastal areas can affect the survival and spatial distribution of various vegetation species by altering plant communities and the wildlife habitats they support. In this study, a baseline model was developed based on FEMWATER to simulate the monthly variation of root zone salinity of a geo-typical area located at the Cape Canaveral Barrier Island Complex (CCBIC) of coastal east-central Florida (USA) in 2010. Based on the developed and calibrated baseline model, three diagnostic FEMWATER models were developed to predict the extent of SWI into root zone by modifying the boundary values representing the rising sea level based on various sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios projected for 2080. The simulation results indicated that the extent of SWI would be insignificant if SLR is either low (23.4 cm) or intermediate (59.0 cm), but would be significant if SLR is high (119.5 cm) in that infiltration/diffusion of overtopping seawater in coastal low-lying areas can greatly increase root zone salinity level, since the sand dunes may fail to prevent the landward migration of seawater because the waves of the rising sea level can reach and pass over the crest under high (119.5 cm) SLR scenario.

Rapid and Intense Phosphate Desorption Kinetics When Saltwater Intrudes into Carbonate Rock,"Flower, H.; Rains, M.; Lewis, D.; Zhang, J.-Z.","It is important to understand how phosphate sorption dynamics of coastal carbonate aquifers are affected by seawater intrusion, because many coastal aquifers are composed of carbonate rocks and subject to an increase in saltwater intrusion during relative sea-level rise. Twelve carbonate rock and unconsolidated sediment specimens were acquired from a test corehole spanning the full thickness of the Biscayne aquifer in southeastern Florida. All 12 samples exhibit low phosphorus content but variable contents of iron. Column leaching experiments were conducted with two carbonate aquifer samples, alternating between freshwater and saltwater flow. With the first influx of saltwater, phosphate concentration in leachate increased rapidly from a freshwater value of approximately 0.2Â Î¼M to peaks of between 0.8 and 1.6Â Î¼M. The phosphate concentration began to diminish as saltwater continued to flow, but sustained desorption continued for over 2Â h. Overall, seawater drove sorption behavior much more than chemical composition for the aquifer rocks and sediment from the seven rock samples for which we did isotherm sorption experiments. Our results indicate that an immediate and intense pulse of phosphate desorption from carbonate rock and sediment with low phosphorus content occurs in response to an influx of seawater and that the duration of desorption will vary by layer within a single aquifer.

Halocarbon Emissions from a Degraded Forested Wetland in Coastal South Carolina Impacted by Sea Level Rise,"Jiao, Y.; Ruecker, A.; Deventer, M.J.; Chow, A.T.; Rhew, R.C.","Tropical- and subtropical-storm surges combined with sea level rise cause saltwater intrusions into low-lying coastal ecosystems along the southeastern coast of the United States, gradually converting freshwater forested wetland into saltmarsh. The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems becomes a degraded forested wetland, where the combination of high levels of soil organic matter and elevated concentrations of halide ions creates a dynamic biogeochemical environment that may be a potential hotspot for halocarbon formation such as chloroform, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide. This study conducted field measurements at a transition zone in coastal South Carolina to quantify halocarbon exchange rates and laboratory soil incubations to determine the contributions of biotic versus abiotic processes. The degraded forested wetland showed significant chloroform emission rates (146 Â± 129 nmol m-2 d-1). The degraded forested wetland remained a net sink for methyl chloride and a negligible source/sink for methyl bromide, unlike the saltmarsh which was a significant source for both. The laboratory incubations strongly suggest that methyl halide consumption in soils at the field site was biotic and that production of methyl halides and chloroform was largely abiotic and temperature-dependent, although additional experiments are required to rule out possible biotic production involving heat-resistant microbes. The results suggest that sea level rise and more frequent storm surges derived from global climate change, in the long term, may increase emissions of chloroform from coastal degraded forested wetlands and of methyl halides if salt marshes expand, with potential impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion.

Land subsidence mitigation aquifer recharge using treated wastewater injection,"Spellman, F.R.","This book examines the process of injecting treated wastewater into wells to replenish aquifers, and thereby slow the process of land subsidence, and help to mitigate coastal flooding. It explains how up to fifty percent of sea-level rise may be due to land subsidence, and up to fifty percent of land subsidence may be due to aquifer compaction. The concepts covered discuss replenishing aquifers with clean water to reduce nutrient discharges into out-falled waterways; providing a sustainable supply of groundwater; reducing the rate of land subsidence; and protecting the groundwater from saltwater intrusion.

Litter Decomposition of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus: Implications of Climate Change in Salt Marshes,"Wu, W.; Huang, H.; Biber, P.; Bethel, M.","Decomposition of plant litter in salt marshes plays an important role in coastal trophodynamics, nutrient cycling, sediment trapping, and short-term carbon storage, all of which are likely to be affected by climate change and accelerated sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, longer and more frequent inundation, and saltwater intrusion will all interact to affect decomposition of plant litter in a complex way. A combination of field experiments and model selection techniques was applied to study how these environmental factors affected litter decomposition of two dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results from summer field experiments conducted between June and August of 2013 showed that S. alterniflora in the low marsh had higher litter losses (0.286 Â± 0.0883 g d-1, mean Â± standard deviation) and decomposition coefficients (0.0115 Â± 0.00416 d-1) than J. roemerianus in the midmarsh locations (0.0963 Â± 0.0480 g d-1, 0.00416 Â± 0.00223 d-1). Modeling results showed that the interaction between temperature and salinity significantly affected decomposition coefficients of both species positively during this experiment. This study suggests that accelerated leaf litter decomposition due to rising temperature and increased salinity will occur under climate change and sea-level rise, and this will potentially lead to important ecological consequences for salt marshes.

Design and Construction of an Automated Irrigation System for Simulating Saltwater Intrusion in a Tidal Freshwater Wetland,"Lee, D.Y.; De Meo, O.A.; Thomas, R.B.; Tillett, A.L.; Neubauer, S.C.","Sea-level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. To simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. The system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. During low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. This system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. Porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation. This porewater manipulation led to changes in the plant community and in exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane between the marsh and atmosphere. The system has proven to be a reliable way of manipulating wetland salinity for studying changes in the physicochemical environment. With modifications, it could be used to manipulate nutrient loads, hydrology, and sediment supply in other wetland systems.

"Increased Total Dissolved Solids, Chloride, and Bromide Concentrations Due to Sea-Level Rise in a Coastal Aquifer","Motz, L.H.; Kurki-Fox, J.; Ged, E.C.; Boyer, T.H.","Rising sea levels can increase saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers, affecting well fields by contaminating groundwater with increased total dissolved solids (TDS) and chloride concentrations. A groundwater model was created for Broward County in southeastern Florida, U.S.A., to simulate the increased TDS and chloride concentrations in a coastal well field due to sea-level rise (SLR)-induced saltwater intrusion. The objectives of the modeling were to simulate the increase in TDS and chloride concentrations in a well field for a range of SLR scenarios and quantify the results with respect to secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) for TDS and chloride. Bromide concentrations were also simulated because bromide can form toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. SLR projections for the model were based on projections that follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology in its Fourth Assessment Report, but they also include the effects of ice sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica. These projections provide for three scenarios of SLR from 1990 to 2100, corresponding to 5%, 50%, and 95% confidence levels. These estimates were extrapolated as part of this investigation to obtain projections of 0.11 m, 0.49 m, and 0.91 m SLR for three 100-year simulations from 2015 to 2115. A three-dimensional numerical groundwater model was constructed using the variable-density groundwater flow and transport code SEAWAT, and simulations were run for three 100-year transient simulations with maximum sea-level rise values at the coastal boundaries corresponding to the 5%, 50%, and 95% confidence-level sea-level rise projections. Average TDS concentrations in 10 production wells were obtained from the SEAWAT results, and chloride and bromide concentrations were calculated using standard seawater ratios for chloride and bromide relative to TDS. The bromide concentrations were used to model the concentrations of four trihalomethane species (THM4) that represent DPBs that could be formed following chlorine addition during drinking water treatment. The results from the simulations indicate that the SMCLs for TDS and chloride, which are based on cosmetic and aesthetic effects, will be exceeded in approximately 65 years from the start of the SLR simulations at the 95% confidence level for SLR. Of even greater significance, the results also indicate that the primary maximum contaminant level for THM4, which is based on health effects, will be exceeded in approximately 30 years from the start of the SLR simulations at the 95% confidence level for SLR.

"Impact of sea level rise on the fresh-saltwater interface in the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer, California","Tyagi, A.K.; Dyer, W.L.; Ali, A.K.; Hamilton, M.","This paper evaluates the impact of sea level rise on the movement of fresh-salt water interface in coastal aquifers. The US geological survey completed a hydrogeological investigation of the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer in 2012. Based on the hydrogeological data from the USGS investigation, the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer is classified as a two-layer aquifer. The first layer has a hydraulic conductivity of 58m/day for the first 100m below the water table and the second layer has a hydraulic conductivity of 7.6m/day for another 100m below the first layer. In 2007 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the sea level rise in the coastal areas for the US. For the Oxnard area, the most plausible sea level rise was computed to be 0.6m by 2040. This paper combines the information of sea level rise from IPCC and the hydrogeological information to examine the fresh-saltwater interface inland in the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer. The U-tube model was used to determine the distribution of the fresh-saltwater interface in the aquifer. The results of this model compares closely with actual field observations of the interface using the data of salinity in the aquifer. Â© 2015 ASCE.",2015,,"World Environ. Water Resour.

Tidal marsh plant community response to sea-level rise: A mesocosm study,"Sharpe, P.J.; Baldwin, A.H.","Recent evidence from field surveys suggests that periodic saline intrusions into tidal freshwater wetlands may not reduce plant species richness and that reductions in richness may not occur until a more consistent brackish salinity regime develops. In a greenhouse experiment using tidal wetland mesocosms, we tested the hypothesis that plant species richness of coastal marshes (wetlands dominated by herbaceous plants) would be similar under oligohaline (0.5-5) and freshwater conditions (<0.5) (psu; practical salinity units), provided that propagules of salt-tolerant species were present. We also hypothesized that plant community responses would depend on inundation frequency. Species richness was highest in fresh and oligohaline treatments (<5, 11-13 species per mesocosm) and decreased with increasing salinity up to 12. Inundation frequency did not significantly influence species richness. Aboveground biomass decreased weakly as salinity increased, but the difference between salinity treatments was significant only at the 0.1 level. Flooding did not significantly alter aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass was not significantly influenced by either salinity or flooding treatments (. P<. 0.05). Biomass of individual species and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis indicated a shift toward salt-tolerant plant communities with increasing salinity, but detected little influence of inundation. These findings suggest that species composition shifts may prevent strong reductions in biomass due to loss of individual species as salinity increases, and that community composition will change more rapidly in response to increases in salinity than to inundation increases. Also, saltwater intrusions into low-salinity marshes of up to 6 will not create an immediate and significant reduction in species richness assuming propagules of salt-tolerant plants are available and given the tolerance of many Fresh/Oligohaline species observed in this study to salinity levels â¥6. However, the species composition of fresh and oligohaline wetlands can shift toward a less species-rich brackish plant community within a single growing season under prolonged salinity exposures of 12.

Effects of sea-level rise on barrier island groundwater system dynamics - ecohydrological implications,"Masterson, J.P.; Fienen, M.N.; Thieler, E.R.; Gesch, D.B.; Gutierrez, B.T.; Plant, N.G.","We used a numerical model to investigate how a barrier island groundwater system responds to increases of up to 60 cm in sea level. We found that a sea-level rise of 20 cm leads to substantial changes in the depth of the water table and the extent and depth of saltwater intrusion, which are key determinants in the establishment, distribution and succession of vegetation assemblages and habitat suitability in barrier islands ecosystems. In our simulations, increases in water-table height in areas with a shallow depth to water (or thin vadose zone) resulted in extensive groundwater inundation of land surface and a thinning of the underlying freshwater lens. We demonstrated the interdependence of the groundwater response to island morphology by evaluating changes at three sites.

Tidal freshwater marsh plant responses to low level salinity increases,"Sutter, L.A.; Perry, J.E.; Chambers, R.M.","In a tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) in lower Chesapeake Bay, salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) recently has become established where TFM vegetation previously grew. To determine the potential contribution of saltwater intrusion to the observed species transition, we conducted a mesocosm study subjecting Spartina and two TFM perennials (Peltandra virginica and Leersia oryzoides) to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 2, 4 and 6). We measured plant performance as carbon dioxide flux over the leaf stomata as a proxy for net photosynthesis (Anet), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. For Spartina, all metrics were unchanged across the range of tested salinity. The TFM species, however, had lower Anet than Spartina and decreased with added salinity. TFM biomass was reduced up to 86 % in both the aboveground and belowground compartments, and aboveground nutrient allocation was altered: N increased in Leersia and P increased in Peltandra with increasing salinity. Under this simulation of increased salt intrusion associated with climate change and sea level rise, TFM species responded with decreased biomass and decreased tissue C:N. Although other factors must contribute, the abiotic salt stressor leads to plant responses consistent with the observed replacement of TFM species by Spartina.

Sea level rise and South Florida coastal forests,"Saha, A.K.; Saha, S.; Sadle, J.; Jiang, J.; Ross, M.S.; Price, R.M.; Sternberg, L.S.L.O.; Wendelberger, K.S.","Coastal ecosystems lie at the forefront of sea level rise. We posit that before the onset of actual inundation, sea level rise will influence the species composition of coastal hardwood hammocks and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus L.) forests of the Everglades National Park based on tolerance to drought and salinity. Precipitation is the major water source in coastal hammocks and is stored in the soil vadose zone, but vadose water will diminish with the rising water table as a consequence of sea level rise, thereby subjecting plants to salt water stress. A model is used to demonstrate that the constraining effect of salinity on transpiration limits the distribution of freshwater-dependent communities. Field data collected in hardwood hammocks and coastal buttonwood forests over 11 years show that halophytes have replaced glycophytes. We establish that sea level rise threatens 21 rare coastal species in Everglades National Park and estimate the relative risk to each species using basic life history and population traits. We review salinity conditions in the estuarine region over 1999-2009 and associate wide variability in the extent of the annual seawater intrusion to variation in freshwater inflows and precipitation. We also examine species composition in coastal and inland hammocks in connection with distance from the coast, depth to water table, and groundwater salinity.

Biogeochemical effects of simulated sea level rise on carbon loss in an Everglades mangrove peat soil,"Chambers, L.G.; Davis, S.E.; Troxler, T.; Boyer, J.N.; Downey-Wall, A.; Scinto, L.J.","Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

"Changes in wetland forest structure, basal growth, and composition across a tidal gradient","Anderson, C.J.; Lockaby, B.G.; Click, N.","Because of their proximity to oceanic waters, freshwater tidal forests are susceptible to impacts from future climate change and sea level rise. These wetlands are historically understudied and we conducted our study to improve the understanding of structural changes in forested wetlands as they become tidally influenced. Using 20 forested stands across a tidal gradient on the lower Apalachicola River, Florida we examined changes in forest structure (tree density, size classes), basal growth, sapling/shrub cover and richness, understory cover/richness, and coarse woody debris. Tidal wetlands had greater tree (>2.5 cm DBH) density compared to nontidal forests (1446 Â± 159 and 962 Â± 100 stems ha-1, respectively) and more small trees (2.5 to 5.0 cm DBH) (699 and 359 stems ha-1, respectively). Over a 3 y period (2007 to 2010), basal area increment ranged from -0.07 to 0.30 m 2 ha-1 y-1 for tidal wetlands and 0.07 to 0.55 m2 ha-1 y-1 for nontidal wetlands. Both forests experienced tree mortality during the study that influenced basal area. Tidal wetland tree mortality appeared to result from saltwater intrusion while several nontidal forest plots were affected by downed trees during a winter wind storm. Mean sapling/shrub (<2.5 cm DBH) density and richness in tidal forests were more than twice that estimated for nontidal forests. Mean herbaceous cover in tidal wetlands (72 Â± 4%) was significantly higher than nontidal forests (19 Â± 4%) and dominated by perennial herbaceous plants as opposed to nontidal wetlands that were often dominated by tree seedlings. Mean, large, coarse, woody, debris biomass (>7.62 cm diameter) was significantly lower in tidal wetlands compared to nontidal wetlands. Results demonstrated that riparian forests can have large and sudden shifts in stand structure and species composition related to tidal influences where rivers approach the coast.

A density-dependant finite element model for analysis of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Javadi, A.A.","Saltwater intrusion is a serious problem in coastal regions all over the world. It is one of the processes that degrade water-quality by raising salinity to levels exceeding acceptable drinking water standards. It may occur due to human activities and/or by natural events. Over-abstraction is considered the main cause of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea level rise speed up saltwater intrusion. This paper presents the development and validation of a coupled transient finite element model for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport in saturate and unsaturated soils with application to study saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The model includes coupling of water flow, air flow, heat flow and solute transport. Furthermore, transient density-dependent flow is included in the model and the dependency of dispersion on velocity is considered. Different mechanisms that govern solute transport in porous media including, advection, diffusion, dispersion, adsorption, chemical reactions and biological degradation are included in the model. The governing equation of the solute transport is solved together with three balance equations for water flow, air flow and heat transfer. The nonlinear system of governing differential equations is solved using the finite element method in the space domain and a finite difference scheme in the time domain. The model is validated by application to a standard case study from the literature (Henry's problem) and then applied to predict saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer.

Tidal Freshwater Wetlands: Variation and Changes,"Barendregt, A.; Swarth, C.W.","Tidal freshwater wetlands (TFW) are situated in the upper estuary in a zone bordered upstream by the nontidal river and downstream by the oligohaline region. Here, discharge of freshwater from the river and the daily tidal pulse from the sea combine to create conditions where TFW develop. TFW are often located where human population density is high, which has led to wetland degradation or destruction. Globally, TFW are largely restricted to the temperate zone where the magnitude of annual river discharge prevents saline waters from penetrating too far inland. The constant input of river water delivers high loads of sediments, dissolved nutrients, and other suspended matter leading to high sedimentation rates and high nutrient levels. Prominent biogeochemical processes include the transformation of nitrogen by bacteria and immobilization of phosphate. A diverse, characteristic vegetation community develops which supports a rich fauna. Biotic diversity is highest in the high marsh areas and decreases in the lower levels where tidal inundation is greatest. Benthic fauna is rather poor in diversity but high in biomass compared to other regions of the estuary. Global climate change is a threat for this system directly by sea level rise, which will cause brackish water to intrude into the fresh system, and indirectly during droughts, which reduce river discharge. Salinity will affect the presence of flora and fauna and facilitates sulfate reduction of organic matter in the soil. Increased decomposition of organic matter following saltwater intrusion can result in a lowering of wetland surface elevation. The papers assembled in this issue focus on how these tidal freshwater wetlands have changed over recent time and how they may respond to new impacts in the future.

"Haloform formation in coastal wetlands along a salinity gradient at South Carolina, United States","Wang, J.-J.; Jiao, Y.; Rhew, R.C.; Chow, A.T.","Environmental contextNatural haloform emissions contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion but there are major unknown or underestimated sources of these gases. This study demonstrates that soil and water at tidal wetlands are important haloform sources, and emissions peak at the forest-marsh transition zone. The low-lying forested wetlands of the south-eastern United States that are facing sea-level rise and seawater intrusion may become hotspots for haloform emission. AbstractSoil haloform emissions are sources of reactive halogens that catalytically deplete ozone in the stratosphere but there are still unknown or underestimated haloform sources. The >200000ha of low-lying tidal freshwater swamps (forests and marshes) in the south-eastern United States could be haloform (CHX3, Xâ¤Cl or Br) sources because sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion bring halides inland where they mix with terrestrial humic substances. To evaluate the spatial variation along the common forest-marsh salinity gradient (freshwater wetland, oligohaline wetland and mesohaline saltmarsh), we measured chloroform emissions from in situ chambers and from laboratory incubations of soil and water samples collected from Winyah Bay, South Carolina. The in situ and soil-core haloform emissions were both highest in the oligohaline wetland, whereas the aqueous production was highest in mesohaline saltmarsh. The predominant source shifted from sediment emission to water emission from freshwater wetland to mesohaline saltmarsh. Spreading out soil samples increased soil haloform emission, suggesting that soil pores can trap high amounts of CHCl3. Soil sterilisation did not suppress CHCl3 emission, indicating the important contribution of abiotic soil CHCl3 formation. Surface wetland water samples from eight locations along a salinity gradient with different management practices (natural v. managed) were subjected to radical-based halogenation by Fenton-like reagents. Halide availability, organic matter source, temperature and light irradiation were all found to affect the radical-based abiotic haloform formation from surface water. This study clearly indicates that soil and water from the studied coastal wetlands are both haloform sources, which however appear to have different formation mechanisms.

Climate change and salinity in drinking water as a global problem: using remote-sensing methods to monitor surface water salinity,"Chong, Y.J.; Khan, A.; Scheelbeek, P.; Butler, A.; Bowers, D.; Vineis, P.","A still neglected consequence of climate change is increasing salinity levels in coastal areas. This is due to a combination of factors including sea-level rise and tropical cyclones transporting saltwater upstream. The salination of drinking water is a problem that could affect millions of people living in coastal areas globally. Excess dietary intake of salt is strongly associated with high blood pressure and gastric cancer. Saltwater intrusion can also have a detrimental effect on crops and agriculture. Measurements of salinity in coastal areas are urgently needed to estimate the extent of the problem and the correlation of saline waters with health outcomes. In situ measurements of salinity cannot capture the complicated spatial and temporal changes that take place in surface water bodies. In this article, we will discuss an effective alternative approach to mapping the salinity distribution of surface water using satellites. Â© 2014 Â© 2014 Taylor & Francis.",2014,,Int. J.

Regeneration of coastal marsh vegetation impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita,"Middleton, B.A.","The dynamics of plant regeneration via seed and vegetative spread in coastal wetlands dictate the nature of community reassembly that takes place after hurricanes or sea level rise. The objectives of my project were to evaluate the potential effects of saltwater intrusion and flooding of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on seedling regeneration in coastal wetlands of the Gulf Coast. Specifically I tested hypotheses to determine for species in fresh, brackish and salt marshes of the Gulf Coast if 1) the pattern of seed germination and seedling recruitment differed with distance from the shoreline, and 2) seed germination and seedling recruitment for various species were reduced in higher levels of water depth and salinity. Regarding Hypothesis 1, seedling densities increased with distance from the shoreline in fresh and brackish water marshes while decreasing with distance from the shoreline in salt marshes. Also to test Hypothesis 1, I used a greenhouse seed bank assay to examine seed germination from seed banks collected at distances from the shoreline in response to various water depths and salinity levels using a nested factorial design. For all marsh types, the influence of water level and salinity on seed germination shifted with distance from the shoreline (i.e., three way interaction of the main effects of distance nested within site, water depth, and salinity). Data from the seed bank assay were also used to test Hypothesis 2. The regeneration of species from fresh, brackish, and salt marshes were reduced in conditions of high salinity and/or water, so that following hurricanes or sea level rise, seedling regeneration could be reduced. Among the species of these coastal marshes, there was some flexibility of response, so that at least some species were able to germinate in either high or low salinity. Salt marshes had a few fresher marsh species in the seed bank that would not germinate without a period of fresh water input (e.g., Sagittaria lancifolia) as well as salt water species (e.g., Avicennia germinans, Salicornia bigelovii). Nevertheless, the species richness of seeds germinating from the seed bank of freshwater marshes was reduced more than in salt marshes, indicating that freshwater marsh regeneration may be more affected by hurricanes and/or sea level rise than salt marshes. From the perspective of short-term seed germination and recruitment following hurricanes, species recruitment is dependent on the post-disturbance conditions of water and salinity.

Saltwater intrusion impacts fish diversity and distribution in the Blackwater River Drainage (Chesapeake Bay watershed),"Love, J.W.; Gill, J.; Newhard, J.J.","We surveyed fish assemblages from Blackwater River drainage (Cambridge, Maryland, USA) to assess spatiotemporal patterns of fish distribution in response to salinity intrusion of freshwater wetlands. Three sites spaced along a longitudinal stream gradient were sampled from each of the Little Blackwater River and Blackwater River from December 2005 to December 2006. Salinity in upstream areas of Blackwater River ranged from 912 psu, while in the Little Blackwater River salinity ranged from 05 psu. Most of the spatial differences in assemblage structure occurred between upstream sites of Blackwater River, an area influenced by saltwater intrusion from the combined effects of sea level rise and a man-made canal, and upstream sites of Little Blackwater River. Freshwater-dependent fishes (e.g., brown bullhead and black crappie) dominated upstream sites of Little Blackwater River, whereas euryhaline species (e.g., killifish and silversides) dominated upstream sites of Blackwater River. We used the Little Blackwater River as a reference system to test the hypothesis that remnant freshwater-dependent fish populations of transitional areas in the Blackwater River may have declined as salinity levels increased. Upstream habitats of Blackwater River were brackish, while such habitats of Little Blackwater River were more persistently freshwater. As salinity increased seasonally in the Little Blackwater River, the abundance of freshwater-dependent fishes declined at two sites. Differences in species diversity and composition between Blackwater River and Little Blackwater River are likely associated with higher salinity and connectivity in upstream portions of the Blackwater River.

Can we save the California delta in the face of sea level rise?,"Roos, M.; de Vries, J.J.","Sea level rise would profoundly affect low-lying coastal and estuary regions of the world and especially the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta in California. This delta, the largest on the west coast of the US, has about 120 000ha below sea level, protected by levees, many on weak peat soil. The delta is also the hub of water transfer from north to south for two big water projects, which are vulnerable to ocean saltwater intrusion. Sea level has been rising slowly and is projected to rise more in the next 100years. This, coupled with continued subsidence, will make it more difficult to protect low-lying delta lands from inundation. The biggest threat is during high water storm events, but also a few summer dry season breaks have affected water exports. Since current rates of ocean rise are slow, a modest continuing effort in levee strengthening to handle a rise of 0.3 to 0.5cmyr-1 could maintain present levels of flood protection for decades. Eventually hard choices will have to be made on which islands to save as costs rise and with better estimates of ocean rise. More than farmland is involved; much infrastructure, such as roads and pipelines, is as well. Â© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2011,,Irrig.

Impact of sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Javadi, A.A.","Climate change, sea level rise, over-pumping and saltwater intrusion present some of the future challenges of water resources management in coastal areas. Over-abstraction is considered one of the main causes of seawater intrusion and the rise in sea levels accelerates the intrusion. With the combined impact of sea level rise and over-pumping the problem becomes exacerbated and requires urgent solutions. Previous studies have mainly focused on the study of impact of sea level rise or over-abstraction on seawater intrusion separately and their combined effects have not been studied in the literature. This paper presents application of a coupled transient density-dependent finite element model to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers and investigates the individual and combined effects of likely sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion. Three scenarios are considered: rise in sea levels due to climate change, decline in groundwater table due to overpumping and combination of sea level rise and over-pumping. The results show that, in the case study considered in this paper, the rise in the sea level moved the transition zone inland by about 5%. However, the combination of sea level rise and over-pumping resulted in further inland movement of the transition zone (about 8%). The amount of intrusion greatly depends on the depth, size and properties of the aquifer. While the intrusion is a few metres in a small aquifer, it could be several kilometres in a large aquifer.

Assessing impacts of sea level rise on seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer with sloped shoreline boundary,"Hussain, M.S.; Javadi, A.A.","This paper investigates the effect of gradual and instantaneous sea level rise (SLR) on the seawater intrusion (SWI) process in coastal aquifer systems with different levels of land-surface inundation. A set of hypothetical case studies with different shoreline slopes is used to conduct this numerical experiment. For the purpose of numerical modelling, a future rate of SLR from 2015 to 2100 is considered based on the moderate expectation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001). The gradual SLR is implemented in two different stages. First, continuous and nonlinear rising of sea level is imposed starting from year 2015 up to the end of the century. After that the final value of sea level is maintained as constant in order to assess the response time spanning to a new steady state condition. The effects of pumping resulting in lowering of groundwater level are also considered together with the dynamic variation of sea level. The results show that the rate and the amount of SWI are considerably greater in aquifers with flat shoreline slopes compared with those with steep slopes. Moreover, a shorter period of time is required to reach a new steady state condition in systems with flatter slopes. The SWI process is followed by a significant depletion in quantity of freshwater resources at the end of the century. The situation is exacerbated with combined action of SLR and over-abstraction. Finally, by considering the effect of inundation of the shoreline due to gradual SLR, the sensitivity of the system to the main aquifer parameters including molecular diffusion of solute, dispersion, hydraulic conductivity and porosity is investigated.

Sea-level rise vulnerability in the countries of the Coral Triangle,"Mcleod, E.; Hinkel, J.; Vafeidis, A.T.; Nicholls, R.J.; Harvey, N.; Salm, R.","Sea-level rise is a major threat facing the Coral Triangle countries in the twenty-first century. Assessments of vulnerability and adaptation that consider the interactions among natural and social systems are critical to identifying habitats and communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and for supporting the development of adaptation strategies. This paper presents such an assessment using the DIVA model and identifies vulnerable coastal regions and habitats in Coral Triangle countries at national and sub-national levels (administrative provinces). The following four main sea-level rise impacts are assessed in ecological, social and economic terms over the twenty-first century: (1) coastal wetland change, (2) increased coastal flooding, (3) increased coastal erosion, and (4) saltwater intrusion into estuaries and deltas. The results suggest that sea-level rise will significantly affect coastal regions and habitats in the Coral Triangle countries, but the impacts will differ across the region in terms of people flooded annually, coastal wetland change and loss, and damage and adaptation costs. Indonesia is projected to be most affected by coastal flooding, with nearly 5. 9 million people expected to experience flooding annually in 2100 assuming no adaptation. However, if adaptation is considered, this number is significantly reduced. By the end of the century, coastal wetland loss is most significant for Indonesia in terms of total area lost, but the Solomon Islands are projected to experience the greatest relative loss of coastal wetlands. Damage costs associated with sea-level rise are highest in the Philippines (US $6. 5 billion/year) and lowest in the Solomon Islands (US $70,000/year). Adaptation is estimated to reduce damage costs significantly, in particular for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia (between 68 and 99%). These results suggest that the impacts of sea-level rise are likely to be widespread in the region and adaptation measures must be broadly applied.

Life history variation along a salinity gradient in coastal marshes,"Martin, S.B.; Hitch, A.T.; Purcell, K.M.; Klerks, P.L.; Leberg, P.L.","Coastal habitats are susceptible to changes in the environment associated with alterations in salinity. A field study was conducted on natural populations of the sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna, the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and the least killifish Heterandria formosa collected from coastal marsh sites along a salinity gradient, to investigate the influence of salinity on body condition and reproductive life history traits. In brackish marsh sites male P. latipinna had the best body conditions, while females had similar body conditions across all 3 marsh types. Female P. latipinna had greater reproductive allotment and fecundity in brackish marshes, where this fish was most abundant. Specimens of G. affinis collected from fresh marsh sites had less favorable body condition, and females had lower reproductive allotment and fecundity than those collected from higher salinities. While G. affinis was more abundant in freshwater marshes than in higher salinity marshes, this higher abundance did not correspond with a better body condition or higher reproductive effort, suggesting that G. affinis may be stressed in freshwater. There was no difference in the conditions between (both male and female) H. formosa from fresh and intermediate marshes. Female H. formosa from fresh marshes had a similar reproductive allotment and lower fecundity than those from intermediate marshes. The 3 species exhibited different life history patterns along the salinity gradient, and some of these patterns conflicted with expectations based on species abundances. When assessing habitat quality along an environmental gradient, measures of abundance should be accompanied by more sensitive indicators of environmental stress. Â© Inter-Research 2009.",2009,,Aqua.

Analysis of saltwater intrusion driven by areal-recharge,"Chang, S.-W.; Clement, T.P.","Salt water intrusion is a process where saline water would naturally intrude into fresh groundwater regions of a coastal aquifer. The process is caused by the higher density of the ocean waters and is often exacerbated by the extraction of fresh ground water in overpumped catchments (Kacimov et al, 2009). A major factor that drives the intrusion process is the density difference. The salt water intrusion process has a significant role in water management in coastal region. It is because a small fraction of the intruded salt can increase the salinity level of an impacted aquifer. Therefore, the location of the interface between the freshwater and saltwater, commonly known as the saltwater wedge, should be carefully managed in coastal areas to avoid an unexpected contamination of drinking water reserves. The salt water wedge could be influenced by various climate patterns or regional rainfall characteristics. Werner and Simmons (2009) explored the changes in the location of the saltwater interface caused by sea level variations in an unconfined coastal aquifer. They illustrated how various factors such as recharge rate, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, and the rate of ground water discharge would influence the movement of a steady-state wedge. They predicted the movement of the wedge toes due to sea-level changes using an idealized steady-state analytical solution. Most realistic field-scale saltwater management problems involve the use of numerical models to make predictions. These models require benchmarks to test their validity. Henry Problem (1960) developed an analytical benchmark problem that has been widely used for validating saltwater intrusion models. Goswami and Clement (2007) conducted a laboratory-scale benchmark experiment for mapping the transport patterns of a saltwater wedge. Abarca and Clement (2009) developed the visualizing method to map a mixing zone between freshwater and salt water interface. In this study, the original Henry benchmark problem was modified to account for areal recharge boundary conditions. We used SEAWAT model to simulate a problem involving regional flux boundary condition and a problem involving recharge flux boundary condition. SEAWAT simulator combines MODFLOW and MT3DMS as a single code to solve the coupled flow and solute-transport equations (Guo and Langevin, 2002). The objectives of our study is to verify a numerical solution with laboratory experiments for a Henry-type benchmark problem involving various flux type boundary conditions and to understand the movement of toe positions due to sea level change through the verified numerical approach. For the two dimensional cross sectional experiment, a soil tank was designed with 50 cm x 28 cm x 2.2 cm dimension. The tank was relatively thin for describing two dimensional domain. The central flow chamber was filled with porous media of 1.1-mm diameter silica beads. A digital photography was used to record the wedge position. The digital data allowed us to zoom and observe small-scale variations allowing quantitative analysis of the wedge and observation of the small-scale transport processes at work. These observations will be used to calibrate a numerical model. The simulation result completed by SEAWAT was compared to the experimental data for the location of saltwater wedge. Our results indicated that the numerical model agrees well with the experimental results for three steady states of (a) regional boundary condition and (b) Areal-recharge boundary condition. The three sets of steady state experimental condition were designated as SS1, SS2 and SS3. Under relatively high incoming flux, the shape of the wedge was not significantly different. SS1 and SS3 results showed almost same length of the toe position and the same discharge boundary (point of contact of salt water wedge with the left boundary). A relatively low incoming flux made different type of wedge. The areal recharge boundary broadened the discharge zone due to greater water flow rate. We performed sensitivity test for the head difference and freshwater flux for the each experiment. Even though the head difference is very sensitive to the model feasibility, we obtained generally good agreement between numerical model simulation and experimental results. Finally we studied the effects of sea-level rise in flux-controlled groundwater problems. In this case, the experimental tests were not employed. We have made an attempt to generate similar looking salt wedges using two distinctly different boundary conditions. (Q/b of original Henry problem is 0.66 cm2/s upon a 200 cmx100 cm domain). As a next step, the salt water head was increased to model the sea-level rise. These theoretical simulation results are applicable on a coastal region where recharge flux is dominant, such as an island. Â© 2010 ASCE.",2010,,World Environ. Water Resour. Congr.: Chall.

The role of genetic structure in the adaptive divergence of populations experiencing saltwater intrusion due to relative sea-level rise,"Purcell, K.M.; Hitch, A.; Martin, S.; Klerks, P.L.; Leberg, P.L.","Saltwater intrusion into estuaries creates stressful conditions for nektonic species. Previous studies have shown that Gambusia affinis populations with exposure to saline environments develop genetic adaptations for increased survival during salinity stress. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of G. affinis populations, previously shown to have adaptations for increased salinity tolerance, and determine the impact of selection and gene flow on structure of these populations. We found that gene flow was higher between populations experiencing different salinity regimes within an estuary than between similar marsh types in different estuaries, suggesting the development of saline-tolerant phenotypes due to local adaptation. There was limited evidence of genetic structure along a salinity gradient, and only some of the genetic variation among sites was correlated with salinity. Our results suggest limited structure, combined with selection to saltwater intrusion, results in phenotypic divergence in spite of a lack of physical barriers to gene flow. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Adapting to rising sea level: A florida perspective,"Parkinson, R.W.","Global climate change and concomitant rising sea level will have a profound impact on Florida's coastal and marine systems. Sea-level rise will increase erosion of beaches, cause saltwater intrusion into water supplies, inundate coastal marshes and other important habitats, and make coastal property more vulnerable to erosion and flooding. Yet most coastal areas are currently managed under the premise that sea-level rise is not significant and the shorelines are static or can be fixed in place by engineering structures. The new reality of sea-level rise and extreme weather due to climate change requires a new style of planning and management to protect resources and reduce risk to humans. Scientists must: (1) assess existing coastal vulnerability to address short term management issues and (2) model future landscape change and develop sustainable plans to address long term planning and management issues. Furthermore, this information must be effectively transferred to planners, managers, and elected officials to ensure their decisions are based upon the best available information. While there is still some uncertainty regarding the details of rising sea level and climate change, development decisions are being made today which commit public and private investment in real estate and associated infrastructure. With a design life of 30 yrs to 75 yrs or more, many of these investments are on a collision course with rising sea level and the resulting impacts will be significant. In the near term, the utilization of engineering structures may be required, but these are not sustainable and must ultimately yield to ""managed withdrawal"" programs if higher sealevel elevations or rates of rise are forthcoming. As an initial step towards successful adaptation, coastal management and planning documents (i.e., comprehensive plans) must be revised to include reference to climate change and rising sea-level.

Dania beach pursues horizontal wells,"Bloetscher, F.; Muniz, A.","The City of Dania Beach is in need of additional water supply. Because of the potential for saltwater intrusion and the uncertainty of sea level rise, the City's current wells will likely be negatively impacted. Because the alternatives for new water supplies are limited (mostly saltwater sources), a small City like Dania Beach can be confronted by significant costs to build new water treatment facilities. As a result, the City is looking at the use of horizontal well technology to capture water that would otherwise be lost to tide. Horizontal wells have not been used in South Florida except as exfiltration trenches for drainage purposes. Downstream of salinity structures, the natural water table head diminishes. Horizontal wells could spread the cone of depression and minimize drawdowns to permit additional capture of fresh water.

Investigation of sea level rise effect on saltwater intrusion in an unconfined coastal aquifer using sharp-interface approach,"Vafaie, F.; Sadjad Mehdizadeh, S.","A numerical sharp-interface model is developed to predict saltwater intrusion (SWI) into an unconfined coastal aquifer due to sea level rise (SLR). The model is applied to a conceptual field-scale aquifer to explore the sensitivity of the intrusion mechanism to various involved parameters. In all of the simulations, appropriate SLR rate has been applied to the sharp-interface model. The 90 years unsteady results showed that changes in hydraulic conductivity, rainfall recharge and freshwater inflow have significant effect on intrusion but the model is not very sensitive to different values of porous media porosity and specific yield. Afterward, the seaside saltwater head is raised and the toe of new time dependent salt wedge is determined. The results demonstrated that the SLR leads to more SWI. This excess intrusion is not very clear when SLR rate is low (e.g., 0.2 mm/year) but saltwater intrudes significantly further when the rate gets the higher values (e.g., 8 mm/year).

Modeling Potential Shifts in Hawaiian Anchialine Pool Habitat and Introduced Fish Distribution due to Sea Level Rise,"Marrack, L.","Global mean sea levels may rise between 0.75 and 1.9Â m by 2100 changing the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems due to flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Although habitats will be inundated, ecosystems have the potential to shift inland, and endemic species may persist if conditions are favorable. Predictions of ecosystem migration due to sea level rise need to account for current stressors, which may reduce the resilience of these ecosystems. This study predicts the potential consequences of sea level rise on the groundwater-fed anchialine pool ecosystem in Hawaii. Scenarios of marine and groundwater inundation were compared with current patterns of habitat, introduced fishes, and land use. Results show that current habitats containing endemic anchialine shrimp will be increasingly inundated by marine waters. New habitats will emerge in areas that are low lying and undeveloped. Because of subsurface hydrologic connectivity, endemic shrimp are likely to populate these new habitats by moving through the coastal aquifer. In some areas, rising sea levels will provide surface connectivity between pools currently containing introduced fishes (tilapia, poeciliids) and up to 46Â % of new or existing pools that do not contain these fish. Results predicting future habitat distribution and condition due to sea level rise will support conservation planning.

Predicting the retreat and migration of tidal forests along the northern Gulf of Mexico under sea-level rise,"Doyle, T.W.; Krauss, K.W.; Conner, W.H.; From, A.S.","Tidal freshwater forests in coastal regions of the southeastern United States are undergoing dieback and retreat from increasing tidal inundation and saltwater intrusion attributed to climate variability and sea-level rise. In many areas, tidal saltwater forests (mangroves) contrastingly are expanding landward in subtropical coastal reaches succeeding freshwater marsh and forest zones. Hydrological characteristics of these low-relief coastal forests in intertidal settings are dictated by the influence of tidal and freshwater forcing. In this paper, we describe the application of the Sea Level Over Proportional Elevation (SLOPE) model to predict coastal forest retreat and migration from projected sea-level rise based on a proxy relationship of saltmarsh/mangrove area and tidal range. The SLOPE model assumes that the sum area of saltmarsh/mangrove habitat along any given coastal reach is determined by the slope of the landform and vertical tide forcing. Model results indicated that saltmarsh and mangrove migration from sea-level rise will vary by county and watershed but greater in western Gulf States than in the eastern Gulf States where millions of hectares of coastal forest will be displaced over the next century with a near meter rise in relative sea level alone. Substantial losses of coastal forests will also occur in the eastern Gulf but mangrove forests in subtropical zones of Florida are expected to replace retreating freshwater forest and affect regional biodiversity. Accelerated global eustacy from climate change will compound the degree of predicted retreat and migration of coastal forests with expected implications for ecosystem management of State and Federal lands in the absence of adaptive coastal management.",2010,,For.

Climate Change Projected Effects on Coastal Foundation Communities of the Greater Everglades Using a 2060 Scenario: Need for a New Management Paradigm,"Koch, M.S.; Coronado, C.; Miller, M.W.; Rudnick, D.T.; Stabenau, E.; Halley, R.B.; Sklar, F.H.","Rising sea levels and temperature will be dominant drivers of coastal Evergladesâ foundation communities (i.e., mangrove forests, seagrass/macroalgae, and coral reefs) by 2060 based on a climate change scenario of +1.5Â Â°C temperature, +1.5 foot (46Â cm) in sea level, Â±10Â % in precipitation and 490Â ppm CO2. Current mangrove forest soil elevation change in South Florida ranges from 0.9 to 2.5Â mmÂ yearâ1 and would have to increase twofold to fourfold in order to accommodate a 2060 sea level rise rate. No evidence is available to indicate that coastal mangroves from South Florida and the wider Caribbean can keep pace with a rapid rate of sea level rise. Thus, particles and nutrients from destabilized coastlines could be mobilized and impact benthic habitats of southern Florida. Uncertainties in regional geomorphology and coastal current changes under higher sea levels make this prediction tentative without further research. The 2060 higher temperature scenario would compromise Floridaâs coral reefs that are already degraded. We suggest that a new paradigm is needed for resource management under climate change that manages coastlines for resilience to marine transgression and promotes active ecosystem management. In the case of the Everglades, greater freshwater flows could maximize mangrove peat accumulation, stabilize coastlines, and limit saltwater intrusion, while specific coral species may require propagation. Further, weÂ suggest that regional climate drivers and oceanographic processes be incorporated into Everglades and South Florida management plans, as they are likely to impact coastal ecosystems, interior freshwater wetlands and urban coastlines over the next few decades.

Experimental and numerical investigation of saltwater intrusion dynamics in flux-controlled groundwater systems,"Chang, S.W.; Clement, T.P.","Sea level rise and reduction of groundwater fluxes due to changes in rainfall patterns are the two major climate change-induced hydrological variables that can severely affect saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. In this study we use a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to study the impacts of changes in one of these climate change-induced hydrological variables, groundwater flux, on saltwater intrusion process. We have completed experiments in a laboratory-scale model to study the changes in two types of groundwater fluxes - areal recharge flux and regional flux. The experimental results were modeled using the numerical code SEAWAT. The transient data sets reported in this study are useful benchmarks for testing numerical models that employ flux-type boundary conditions. Also, based on the experimental observations, we hypothesize that when the fluxes are perturbed, it would require relatively less time for a salt wedge to recede from an aquifer when compared to the time required to advance into the aquifer. This rather counterintuitive hypothesis implies that saltwater intrusion and receding processes are asymmetric and the timescales associated with these processes will be different. We use a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments to test this hypothesis and use the resulting data set to explain the reason for the difference in intrusion rates. Â© 2012.

Does sea-level rise have an impact on saltwater intrusion?,"Chang, S.W.; Clement, T.P.; Simpson, M.J.; Lee, K.-K.","Climate change effects are expected to substantially raise the average sea level. It is widely assumed that this raise will have a severe adverse impact on saltwater intrusion processes in coastal aquifers. In this study we hypothesize that a natural mechanism, identified here as the "" lifting process,"" has the potential to mitigate, or in some cases completely reverse, the adverse intrusion effects induced by sea-level rise. A detailed numerical study using the MODFLOW-family computer code SEAWAT was completed to test this hypothesis and to understand the effects of this lifting process in both confined and unconfined systems. Our conceptual simulation results show that if the ambient recharge remains constant, the sea-level rise will have no long-term impact (i.e., it will not affect the steady-state salt wedge) on confined aquifers. Our transient confined-flow simulations show a self-reversal mechanism where the wedge which will initially intrude into the formation due to the sea-level rise would be naturally driven back to the original position. In unconfined systems, the lifting process would have a lesser influence due to changes in the value of effective transmissivity. A detailed sensitivity analysis was also completed to understand the sensitivity of this self-reversal effect to various aquifer parameters. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,,Adv.

A salinity management model for restoration of a coastal riverine ecosystem,"Hu, G.G.","The Northwest Fork of the Loxahatchee River contains one of the last examples of a pristine subtropical riverine cypress swamp in South Florida. The permanent opening of the Jupiter Inlet along with sea level rise and reduced dry season freshwater flows in the Northwest Fork has allowed salt water to migrate upriver causing the introduction of mangroves into areas once dominated by freshwater floodplain swamp vegetation, particularly bald cypress. Restoration of this natural resource requires reducing or reversing the current condition of saltwater intrusion and maintaining the freshwater habitats in the upper reaches of the Northwest Fork to protect existing populations and distribution of wildlife that require freshwater habitat. A computer program was developed to predict salinity and calculate other performance parameters under various ecosystem restoration scenarios. Field data, regression analysis and results of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic computer models were integrated into a system simulation and management tool. Salinity prediction and other computations were conducted over a 39-year period. Such long-term simulations are required to investigate ecosystem response and assess the effectiveness of the proposed restoration approach. The model also contains system management functions such as the calculation of additional freshwater demand for salinity management under various restoration alternatives.

"Through droughts and hurricanes: Tree mortality, forest structure, and biomass production in a coastal swamp targeted for restoration in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain","Hoeppner, S.S.; Shaffer, G.P.; Perkins, T.E.","Coastal swamps are among the rapidly vanishing wetland habitats in Louisiana due to accelerated sea-level rise and hydrological alterations that alter the natural flooding regime. In particular, the swamp forests of Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, have degraded considerably, and research regarding their condition might suggest approaches for their restoration. We measured forest structure, species composition, tree mortality, annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of woody species, and aboveground biomass allocation to leaf litter and wood, and soil strength at forty study plots within the Lake Maurepas basin over 5 years to evaluate the current condition of this coastal forested wetland. Local measures of salinity and regional measures of flooding were used to predict ANPP and aboveground biomass allocation. The 5-year study period included an intense drought as well as years characterized by hurricane-induced flooding. The forty study plots could be divided into four distinct habitat clusters based on standing biomass, structural variables, and salinity. The majority of the plots were co-dominated by Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica. Acer rubrum var. drummondii and Fraxinus pennsylvanica were common mid-story species throughout the western and southern parts of the study area, while Salix nigra, Morella cerifera, and Triadica sebiferum were more important at the more degraded plots in the eastern part of the basin. Annual mean soil salinity reached unprecedented level (2-5 psu) during the drought and cumulative tree mortality reached up to 85% in areas characterized by frequent saltwater intrusions. The ANPP was higher during the drought period in 2000-2001 than during subsequent years, and was dominated by T. distichum. At most sampling plots, litter production exceeded wood production annually. A negative correlation between aboveground biomass allocation to litter and flooding indicated that biomass allocation shifted from litter toward wood during wet years. Overall, the majority of the plots sampled produced less than 400 g m-2 yr-1 of aboveground biomass annually due to the interacting negative effects of saltwater intrusion and prolonged flooding with nutrient-poor water. Reintroduction of Mississippi River water to the Maurepas system has the potential to benefit these swamps greatly by restoring a greater flow of nutrients, sediments, and fresh water through the wetlands. The historically slow (i.e., multi-decadal) process of swamp deterioration was greatly sped by low salinity (i.e., 2-5 psu) saltwater intrusions during a drought in 1999-2000. The majority of the coastal swamps in the Pontchartrain Basin are deteriorating, and most of this swamp area will be lost to open water in the foreseeable future if no restoration action is taken.

Numerical simulation of saltwater intrusion in response to sea-level rise,"Langevin, C.D.; Dausman, A.M.","A two dimensional numerical model of variable-density groundwater flow and dispersive solute transport was used to predict the extent, rate, and lag time of saltwater intrusion in response to various sea-level rise scenarios. Three simulations were performed with varying rates of sea-level rise. For the first simulation, sea-level rise was specified at a rate of 0.9 mm/yr, which is the slowest rate of sea-level rise estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). After 100 years, the 250 mg/L chloride isochlor moved inland by about 40 m, and required an additional 8 years for the system to reach equilibrium. For the next simulation, sea-level rise was specified at 4.8 mm/yr, which is the central value of the IPCC estimate. For this moderate rate of sea-level rise, the 250 mg/L isochlor moved inland by about 740 m after 100 years, and required an additional 10 years for the system to reach equilibrium. For the fastest rate of sea level rise estimated by IPCC (8.8 mm/yr), the 250 mg/L isochlor moved inland by about 1800 m after 100 years, and required more than 50 years to reach equilibrium.

"Simulation of seawater intrusion resulting from proposed expanded pumpage in New York City, USA","Misut, P.E.; Voss, C.I.","Ground-water flow and movement of the freshwater/saltwater interface on western Long Island, N.Y., were simulated to evaluate the effects of a proposed increase in ground-water pumpage to meet the New York City's growing demand for freshwater without causing saltwater intrusion. Accurate simulation of the long-term movement of the freshwater/saltwater interface is limited by uncertainty as to the rate of sea-level rise since the Pleistocene glaciation and the amount of flow that moves through offshore breaches in a shallow confining unit, the Gardiners Clay. Reasonable estimates of these and related factors were applied to a three-dimensional version of the U.S. Geological Survey's SUTRA model to predict interface movement in response to the proposed increase in pumpage. Hypothetical wells for the proposed expansion were sited to minimize the effects of saltwater intrusion and ground-water flooding of subsurface structures in low-lying areas. Overpumping on western Long Island induced severe saltwater intrusion in the 1940's, which necessitated well abandonment and has resulted in ground-water flooding through the ensuing water-table recovery. The results of this investigation indicate that well locations and pumping rates can be optimized to minimize saltwater intrusion while providing the benefits of the increased pumpage.

"Wetland loss dynamics in southwestern Barataria basin, Louisiana (USA), 1945-1985","Evers, D.E.; Gosselink, J.G.; Sasser, C.E.; Hill, J.M.","We determined spatial associations of wetland loss rates in a 950-km2 study area in the southwestern Barataria basin of Louisiana's Mississippi River delta plain for four intervals spanning 40 years, 1945-1985. A geographic information system was used to analyze spatial and temporal changes. Annual wetland loss rates increased over the 40 years; the rate of increase in annual rates accelerated through 1980 and then began to decelerate. The average annual rate of wetland loss for the entire study area increased from 0.2%/yr during 1945-1956, to 1.2%/yr for 1956-1969, 1.9%/yr for 1969-1980, and 2.0%/yr for 1980-1985. Wetland loss was not uniform throughout the study area. Eight sub-areas were identified as having different densities and/or causes of loss. Processes implicated in the differing loss rates include sea level rise, shoreline erosion, accelerated subsidence along natural levees, canal modification of hydrologic flows, interference of dredged material with sheet flow, and saltwater intrusion. In some areas, several processes are believed to operate together to induce wetland degradation and wetland loss.

A potential interaction between sea-level rise and global warming: Implications for coastal stability on the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain,"Thomson, D.M.; Shaffer, G.P.; McCorquodale, J.A.","A portion of the southeastern United States is currently experiencing the most severe drought on record. Rainfall deficits accumulated since 1998 have led to a twofold increase in mean annual salinity in the study area, a wetland landbridge located in the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary in southeastern Louisiana. Global circulation models have predicted a rise in both the frequency and amplitude of extreme weather if global warming continues. This indicates a threat to the stability of deltaic plains, particularly those with altered hydrologies. Throughout the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain, river control structures have eliminated freshwater inputs. Generally, this should lead to increases in salinity that can become particularly acute during drought events. Such conditions have been shown to play a decisive role in plant community ecology, an important force in deltaic plain stability. Beyond certain thresholds; these conditions can have detrimental effects upon primary production. The accumulation of primary production deficits may lead to increases in the rate of relative sea-level rise. Though the drought is not proven to be the result of global warming, this event shows that coastal ecology is sensitive to drought conditions and any increase will be detrimental to floodplain stability.

Impact of sea level rise on saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Tyagi, A.K.","This investigation concerns the hydrodynamics of the intrusion and dispersion of a fresh-salt water interface in coastal ground water systems. Primary attention is focused on developing a model to predict the rate of dispersion of the interface in natural aquifers. Mathematical models including the density and viscosity effects are incorporated. Since the fresh and salt water are miscible, a transition zone is created due to dispersion of the interface, caused by the secular flow and tidal fluctuations. A field example using realistic parameters from a natural aquifer is presented to determine the extent of intrusion of the interface for a given secular variation of flow in the aquifer. Then the growth of the transition zone is predicted on a space and time basis, utilizing the finite element solution.

Impact of hurricanes storm surges on the groundwater resources,"Van Biersel, T.P.; Carlson, D.A.; Milner, L.R.","Ocean surges onto coastal lowlands caused by tropical and extra tropical storms, tsunamis, and sea level rise affect all coastal lowlands and present a threat to drinking water resources of many coastal residents. In 2005, two such storms, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast of the US. Since September 2005, water samples have been collected from water wells impacted by the hurricanes' storm surges along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in southeastern Louisiana. The private and public water wells tested were submerged by 0.6-4.5 m of surging saltwater for several hours. The wells' casing and/or the associated plumbing were severely damaged. Water samples were collected to determine if storm surge water inundated the well casing and, if so, its effect on water quality within the shallow aquifers of the Southern Hills Aquifer System. In addition, the samples were used to determine if the impact on water quality may have long-term implication for public health. Laboratory testing for several indicator parameters (Ca/Mg, Cl/Si, chloride, boron, specific conductance and bacteria) indicates that surge water entered water wells' casing and the screened aquifer. Analysis of the groundwater shows a decrease in the Ca/Mg ratio right after the storm and then a return toward pre-Katrina values. Chloride concentrations were elevated right after Katrina and Rita, and then decreased downward toward pre-Katrina values.

Flooding and saltwater intrusion: Potential effects on survival and productivity of wetland forests along the U.S. Gulf Coast,"Pezeshki, S.R.; Delaune, R.D.; Patrick Jr., W.H.","The predicted global warming trend and resultant sea-level rise will increase inundation and salinity along coastal regions worldwide. As water level increases, saltwater encroaches farther inland in many coastal areas. Responses of Gulf of Mexico coastal tree species to increased flooding and saltwater intrusion is evaluated. A review of investigations which address changes in morphological characteristics and carbon assimilation rates under short-term flooding and/or salinity conditions is presented. The combination of flooding and salinity causes foliage damage and substantial reductions in carbon assimilation. The morphological response and reductions in gas exchange rates are closely associated with increases in salt levels. Exposure to salt concentrations greater than 50 mol m-3 (3 ppt) causes some leaf burning and decline in carbon assimilation rates of up to 84% in seedlings of some species. Results indicated that increased flooding and saltwater intrusion, a problem facing U.S. Golf Coast bottomland forests, can cause drastic reduction in net carbon assimilation, leaf burning and seedling mortality. The stress at sublethal levels can lead to weaker seedlings and, consequently, reduced survival rates, and the potential for long-term habitat changes thus limiting the existing natural range of these forests.

Asesment of impact of climate change on ground water resources,"Kumar, C.P.","Climate change poses uncertainties to the supply and management of water resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the global mean surface temperature has increased 0.6 Â± 0.2Â°C since 1861, and predicts an increase of 2 to 4Â°C over the next 100 years. Temperature increases also affect the hydrologic cycle by directly increasing evaporation of available surface water and vegetation transpiration. Consequently, these changes can influence precipitation amounts, timings and intensity rates, and indirectly impact the flux and storage of water in surface and subsurface reservoirs (i.e., lakes, soil moisture, groundwater). In addition, there may be other associated impacts, such as sea water intrusion, water quality deterioration, potable water shortage, etc. While climate change affects surface water resources directly through changes in the major long-term climate variables such as air temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration, the relationship between the changing climate variables and groundwater is more complicated and poorly understood. The greater variability in rainfall could mean more frequent and prolonged periods of high or low groundwater levels, and saline intrusion in coastal aquifers due to sea level rise and resource reduction. Groundwater resources are related to climate change through the direct interaction with surface water resources, such as lakes and rivers, and indirectly through the recharge process. The direct effect of climate change on groundwater resources depends upon the change in the volume and distribution of groundwater recharge. Therefore, quantifying the impact of climate change on groundwater resources requires not only reliable forecasting of changes in the major climatic variables, but also accurate estimation of groundwater recharge. A number of Global Climate Models (GCM) are available for understanding climate and projecting climate change. There is a need to downscale GCM on a basin scale and couple them with relevant hydrological models considering all components of the hydrological cycle. Output of these coupled models such as quantification of the groundwater recharge will help in taking appropriate adaptation strategies due to the impact of climate change.

Sea water intrusion by sea-level rise: Scenarios for the 21st century,"LoÃ¡iciga, H.A.; Pingel, T.J.; Garcia, E.S.","This study presents a method to assess the contributions of 21st-century sea-level rise and groundwater extraction to sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers. Sea water intrusion is represented by the landward advance of the 10,000 mg/L iso-salinity line, a concentration of dissolved salts that renders groundwater unsuitable for human use. A mathematical formulation of the resolution of sea water intrusion among its causes was quantified via numerical simulation under scenarios of change in groundwater extraction and sea-level rise in the 21st century. The developed method is illustrated with simulations of sea water intrusion in the Seaside Area sub-basin near the City of Monterey, California (USA), where predictions of mean sea-level rise through the early 21st century range from 0.10 to 0.90 m due to increasing global mean surface temperature. The modeling simulation was carried out with a state-of-the-art numerical model that accounts for the effects of salinity on groundwater density and can approximate hydrostratigraphic geometry closely. Simulations of sea water intrusion corresponding to various combinations of groundwater extraction and sea-level rise established that groundwater extraction is the predominant driver of sea water intrusion in the study aquifer.

Impact of sea-level rise on sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Werner, A.D.; Simmons, C.T.","Despite its purported importance, previous studies of the influence of sea-level rise on coastal aquifers have focused on specific sites, and a generalized systematic analysis of the general case of the sea water intrusion response to sea-level rise has not been reported. In this study, a simple conceptual framework is used to provide a first-order assessment of sea water intrusion changes in coastal unconfined aquifers in response to sea-level rise. Two conceptual models are tested: (1) flux-controlled systems, in which ground water discharge to the sea is persistent despite changes in sea level, and (2) head-controlled systems, whereby ground water abstractions or surface features maintain the head condition in the aquifer despite sea-level changes. The conceptualization assumes steady-state conditions, a sharp interface sea water-fresh water transition zone, homogeneous and isotropic aquifer properties, and constant recharge. In the case of constant flux conditions, the upper limit for sea water intrusion due to sea-level rise (up to 1.5 m is tested) is no greater than 50 m for typical values of recharge, hydraulic conductivity, and aquifer depth. This is in striking contrast to the constant head cases, in which the magnitude of salt water toe migration is on the order of hundreds of meters to several kilometers for the same sea-level rise. This study has highlighted the importance of inland boundary conditions on the sea-level rise impact. It identifies combinations of hydrogeologic parameters that control whether large or small salt water toe migration will occur for any given change in a hydrogeologic variable.

Assessing water quality of the Chesapeake Bay by the impact of sea level rise and warming,"Wang, P.; Linker, L.; Wang, H.; Bhatt, G.; Yactayo, G.; Hinson, K.; Tian, R.","The influence of sea level rise and warming on circulation and water quality of the Chesapeake Bay under projected climate conditions in 2050 were estimated by computer simulation. Four estuarine circulation scenarios in the estuary were run using the same watershed load in 1991-2000 period. They are, 1) the Base Scenario, which represents the current climate condition, 2) a Sea Level Rise Scenario, 3) a Warming Scenario, and 4) a combined Sea Level Rise and Warming Scenario. With a 1.6-1.9Â°C increase in monthly air temperatures in the Warming Scenario, water temperature in the Bay is estimated to increase by 0.8-1Â°C. Summer average anoxic volume is estimated to increase 1.4 percent compared to the Base Scenario, because of an increase in algal blooms in the spring and summer, promotion of oxygen consumptive processes, and an increase of stratification. However, a 0.5-meter Sea Level Rise Scenario results in a 12 percent reduction of anoxic volume. This is mainly due to increased estuarine circulation that promotes oxygen-rich sea water intrusion in lower layers. The combined Sea Level Rise and Warming Scenario results in a 10.8 percent reduction of anoxic volume. Global warming increases precipitation and consequently increases nutrient loads from the watershed by approximately 5-7 percent. A scenario that used a 10 percent increase in watershed loads and current estuarine circulation patterns yielded a 19 percent increase in summer anoxic volume, while a scenario that used a 10 percent increase in watershed loads and modified estuarine circulation patterns by the aforementioned sea level rise and warming yielded a 6 percent increase in summer anoxic volume. Impacts on phytoplankton, sediments, and water clarity were also analysed. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2017,,IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ.

A numerical investigation of the mechanisms controlling salt intrusion in the Delaware Bay estuary,"Cook, S.E.; Warner, J.C.; Russell, K.L.","Salinity intrusion in coastal systems is mainly controlled by freshwater inflows. However, extreme events like drought, low-pressure storms, and longer-term sea level rise can exacerbate the landward salt migration and threaten economic infrastructure and ecological health. Along the eastern seaboard of the United States, approximately 13 million people rely on the water resources of the Delaware River basin. Salinity intrusion is actively managed through river discharge targets to suppress the propagation of the salt front (â¼0.52 daily averaged psu line). The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms controlling the location of the salt front in the Delaware Bay estuary using a calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave and Sediment Transport modeling system. This study explored how river discharge, tidal motions, interactions with bathymetric and topographic features, and meteorological events affected the location of the salt front. The model was forced with tides, subtidal water levels, bulk atmospheric conditions, and waves. Compared with the observationally derived location of the salt front line, the model captured the major dynamics throughout the year and performed particularly well during times of low discharge, when salinity intruded up estuary at a constant rate of 0.4 km/day. The daily average salt front moved almost 16 km (10 mi) within a neap-spring tidal cycle, and low-pressure storm systems were found to move the daily averaged salt front by 13â16 km in one event.

Sustainable development goals for reducing the impact of sea level rise on mangrove forests,"Fakhruddin, B.; Mahalingam, R.; Padmanaban, R.","Present study analyses techniques in Remote Sensing (RS) and spatial data in studying the effects of Sea Level Rise (SLR) in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Its importance in restoring and protecting mangroves is reflected most clearly in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Three parameters, including distribution of species, increases in sedimentation, salinity, and flooded areas were analyzed using RS. Data acquired from Landsat Thematic Mapper and field investigations were used to map the forest distribution and MIKE21 and MIKE11 software used to simulate sea level rise scenarios. The analysis showed an increase in the prevalence of Goran (Ceriops) replacing other mangrove species. We also identified there is an upsurge in sedimentation within the Sundarbans is likely to increase with SLR, particularly in river floodplains and increase flood frequency.

Numerical Investigation of River Discharge and Tidal Variation Impact on Salinity Intrusion in a Generic River Delta Through Idealized Modelling,"Matsoukis, C.; Amoudry, L.O.; Bricheno, L.; Leonardi, N.","Salinity in deltaic systems is expected to increase in the near future due to sea level rise. This will cause severe environmental consequences because salinity can be detrimental to agriculture, aquaculture and human consumption. Tidal dynamics are important in regulating salinity in river deltas. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of different tidal amplitudes on deltasâ salinity. This paper investigates the impact of various tidal amplitudes on the spatiotemporal salinity distribution in deltas through three-dimensional idealized modelling. Numerical simulations are carried out with a common hydrograph and different tidal ranges. Both tide-influenced and river-dominated cases were considered. Results suggest that small increases in the tidal amplitude in river-dominated or low tidal regimes cases can have positive effects against salinization. Tide-induced mixing helps to increase freshwater areas and volumes. The water in the delta remains fresh for longer periods in scenarios representative of microtidal regimes. Further increases in the tidal amplitude to meso- and macrotidal levels reverse these effects and reduce freshwater areas and volumes. Results were used to test how salinity correlates with channel orders and river discharge in the presence of tides. These correlations are controlled more by bathymetry than tidal forcing. This study provides important insights into how changes in tidal range could impact spatiotemporal salinity distributions in deltas. Â© 2022, The Author(s).",2023,,Estuar.

Bistability of mangrove forests and competition with freshwater plants,"Jiang, J.; Fuller, D.O.; Teh, S.Y.; Zhai, L.; Koh, H.L.; DeAngelis, D.L.; Sternberg, L.D.S.L.","Halophytic communities such as mangrove forests and buttonwood hammocks tend to border freshwater plant communities as sharp ecotones. Most studies attribute this purely to underlying physical templates, such as groundwater salinity gradients caused by tidal flux and topography. However, a few recent studies hypothesize that self-reinforcing feedback between vegetation and vadose zone salinity are also involved and create a bistable situation in which either halophytic dominated habitat or freshwater plant communities may dominate as alternative stable states. Here, we revisit the bistability hypothesis and demonstrate the mechanisms that result in bistability. We demonstrate with remote sensing imagery the sharp boundaries between freshwater hardwood hammock communities in southern Florida and halophytic communities such as buttonwood hammocks and mangroves. We further document from the literature how transpiration of mangroves and freshwater plants respond differently to vadose zone salinity, thus altering the salinity through feedback. Using mathematical models, we show how the self-reinforcing feedback, together with physical template, controls the ecotones between halophytic and freshwater communities. Regions of bistability along environmental gradients of salinity have the potential for large-scale vegetation shifts following pulse disturbances such as hurricane tidal surges in Florida, or tsunamis in other regions. The size of the region of bistability can be large for low-lying coastal habitat due to the saline water table, which extends inland due to salinity intrusion. We suggest coupling ecological and hydrologic processes as a framework for future studies. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2015,,Agric. For.

What Determines Water Temperature Dynamics in the San Francisco Bay-Delta System?,"Vroom, J.; van der Wegen, M.; Martyr-Koller, R.C.; Lucas, L.V.","Water temperature is an important factor determining estuarine species habitat conditions. Water temperature is mainly governed by advection (e.g., from rivers) and atmospheric exchange processes varying strongly over time (day-night, seasonally) and the spatial domain. On a long time scale, climate change will impact water temperature in estuarine systems due to changes in river flow regimes, air temperature, and sea level rise. To determine which factors govern estuarine water temperature and its sensitivity to changes in its forcing, we developed a process-based numerical model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) and applied it to a well-monitored estuarine system (the San Francisco Estuary) for validation. The process-based approach allows for detailed process description and a physics-based analysis of governing processes. The model was calibrated for water year 2011 and incorporated 3-D hydrodynamics, salinity intrusion, water temperature dynamics, and atmospheric coupling. Results show significant skill in reproducing temperature observations on daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. In North San Francisco Bay, thermal stratification is present, enhanced by salinity stratification. The temperature of the upstream, fresh water Delta area is captured well in 2-D mode, although locallyâon a small scaleâvertical processes (e.g., stratification) may be important. The impact of upstream river temperature and discharge and atmospheric forcing on water temperatures differs throughout the Delta, possibly depending on dispersion and residence times. Our modeling effort provides a sound basis for future modeling studies including climate change impact on water temperature and associated ecological modeling, e.g., clam and fish habitat and phytoplankton dynamics.

Ecological Effects of Climate-Driven Salinity Variation in the San Francisco Estuary: Can We Anticipate and Manage the Coming Changes?,"Ghalambor, C.K.; Gross, E.S.; Grosholz, E.D.; Jeffries, K.M.; Largier, J.L.; McCormick, S.D.; Sommer, T.; Velotta, J.P.; Whitehead, A.","Climate change-driven sea level rise and altered precipitation regimes are predicted to alter patterns of salt intrusion within the San Francisco Estuary. A central question is: Can we use existing knowledge and future projections to predict and manage the anticipated ecological impacts? This was the subject of a 2018 symposium entitled âEcological and Physiological Impacts of Salinization of Aquatic Systems from Human Activities.â The symposium brought together an inter-disciplinary group of scientists and researchers, resource managers, and policy-makers. Here, we summarize and review the presentations and discussions that arose during the symposium. From a historical perspective, salt intrusion has changed substantially over the past 10,000 years as a result of changing climate patterns, with additional shifts from recent anthropogenic effects. Current salinity patterns in the San Francisco Estuary are driven by a suite of hydrodynamic processes within the given contexts of water management and geography. Based on climate projections for the coming century, significant changes are expected in the processes that determine the spatial and temporal patterns of salinity. Given that native speciesâincluding fishes such as the Delta Smelt and Sacramento Splittailâtrack favorable habitats, exhibit physiological acclimation, and can adaptively evolve, we present a framework for assessing their vulnerability to altered salinity in the San Francisco Estuary. We then present a range of regulatory and structural management tools that are available to control patterns of salinity within the San Francisco Estuary. Finally, we identify major research priorities that can help fill critical gaps in our knowledge about future salinity patterns and the consequences of climate change and sea level rise. These research projects will be most effective with strong linkages and communication between scientists and researchers, resource managers, and policy-makers. Â© 2021.

Causal mechanisms of soil organic matter decomposition: deconstructing salinity and flooding impacts in coastal wetlands,"Stagg, C.L.; Schoolmaster, D.R.; Krauss, K.W.; Cormier, N.; Conner, W.H.","Coastal wetlands significantly contribute to global carbon storage potential. Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short- and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands. Here, we identify three causal mechanisms that can reconcile disparities between long-term and short-term salinity impacts on organic matter decomposition.

"Impacts of 150 Years of Shoreline and Bathymetric Change in the Coos Estuary, Oregon, USA","Eidam, E.F.; Sutherland, D.A.; Ralston, D.K.; Dye, B.; Conroy, T.; Schmitt, J.; Ruggiero, P.; Wood, J.","Estuaries worldwide have evolved over the past few centuries under development activities like dredging and shoreline reclamation, which commonly lead to increased channel depths and reduced intertidal areas. The Coos Estuary offers a useful example of how these changes, common to diverse global estuaries, have altered tidal and salt dynamics, with implications for estuarine habitats. In the past 150Â years, the primary navigation channel has been deepened from ~ 6.7 to 11Â m, generating a 12% decrease in estuary area and 21% increase in volume. To evaluate the present and future impacts on the Coos and similar estuaries, a hydrodynamic model was implemented using a detailed bathymetric dataset compiled from multiple data sources including agency charts, water-penetrating lidar, and single-beam-sonar small-vessel surveys. The model was then re-run usingÂ grids constructed from 1865 survey data and a future proposed dredging plan. Changes in the hypsometry from 1865 to present have driven a 33% increase in tidal amplitude, an 18% increase in salinity intrusion length, a doubling of the subtidal salt flux, and an increase in ebb dominance of currents. A proposed channel-depth increase from 11 to 14Â m is predicted to generate a negligible change in tidal range and a small increase in the salinity intrusion length. These results highlight the utility of curating high-resolution bathymetric datasets for coastal management applications through modeling. The historical and modern models quantify how local bathymetric modifications can significantly alter tidal and salinity regimes and provide context for estuarine response to global climate-change drivers.

Forcing uncertainty and salinity response to dredging in a tidal freshwater river,"Miller, R.L.","This study evaluates the salinity response to dredging under different forcing regimes for a 75-kilometer segment of the flood-prone Vermilion River located in coastal Louisiana, USA. The Vermilion is a tidal freshwater river affected by baseflow regulation, rapid urbanization, and hydromodification. This river also serves as major freshwater resource for the region. An efficient one-dimensional model calibrated previously for stage and water temperature is used to analyse the salinity impacts due to a large-scale flood control dredging. The analysis is based on 200 alternative scenarios based on combinations of uncertain key forcing variables for a critical 13-day intrusion period. The analysis reveals a nonlinear effect on mean salinities and position of the brackish water limit as a function of uncertain forcing variables. Dredging also increases the variability of salinity encroachment effects due to uncertainty in future forcing conditions (e.g. relative sea level rise, baseflow diversion volumes, and salinities at the river mouth). The robust analysis presented here provides a foundation for future model-based assessments of under-studied tidal freshwater rivers and provides key insights for coastal management and sustainability efforts in general.

Salt wedge dynamics lead to enhanced sediment trapping within side embayments in high-energy estuaries,"Yellen, B.; Woodruff, J.D.; Ralston, D.K.; MacDonald, D.G.; Jones, D.S.","Off-river coves and embayments provide accommodation space for sediment accumulation, particularly for sandy estuaries where high energy in the main channel prevents significant long-term storage of fine-grained material. Seasonal sediment inputs to Hamburg Cove in the Connecticut River estuary (USA) were monitored to understand the timing and mechanisms for sediment storage there. Unlike in freshwater tidal coves, sediment was primarily trapped here during periods of low discharge, when the salinity intrusion extended upriver to the cove entrance. During periods of low discharge and high sediment accumulation, deposited sediment displayed geochemical signatures consistent with a marine source. Numerical simulations reveal that low discharge conditions provide several important characteristics that maximize sediment trapping. First, these conditions allow the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) to be located in the vicinity of the cove entrance, which increases sediment concentrations during flood tide. Second, the saltier water in the main channel can enter the cove as a density current, enhancing near-bed velocities and resuspending sediment, providing an efficient delivery mechanism. Finally, higher salinity water accumulates in the deep basin of the cove, creating a stratified region that becomes decoupled from ebb currents, promoting retention of sediment in the cove. This process of estuarine-enhanced sediment accumulation in off-river coves will likely extend upriver during future sea level rise. Â© 2017. American Geophysical Union.

Tidal Freshwater Marshes Harbor Phylogenetically Unique Clades of Sulfate Reducers That Are Resistant to Climate-Change-Induced Salinity Intrusion,"Kearns, P.J.; Weston, N.B.; Bowen, J.L.; Å½ivkoviÄ, T.; Vile, M.A.","Rates of sea level rise associated with climate change are predicted to increase in the future, potentially altering ecosystems at all ecological levels. Sea level rise can increase the extent of brackish water intrusion into freshwater ecosystems, which in turn can affect the structure and function of resident microbial communities. In this study, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment using intact tidal freshwater marsh sediment cores to examine the effect of a 5-part per thousand (ppt) salinity increase on the diversity and community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. We used a clone library approach to examine the dsrA gene, which encodes an important catalytic enzyme in sulfate reduction. Our results indicate that tidal freshwater marshes contain extremely diverse communities of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Members of these communities were, on average, only 71Â % similar to known cultured sulfate reducers and 81Â % similar to previously sequenced environmental clones. Salinity and associated increases in sulfate availability did not significantly affect the diversity or community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. However, carbon quality and quantity, which correlated with depth, were found to be the strongest drivers of sulfate-reducing community structure. Our study demonstrates that the sulfate-reducing community in tidal freshwater marsh sediments appears resistant to increased salinity in the face of sea level rise. Additionally, the microorganisms that comprise this sulfate-reducing community appear to be unique to tidal freshwater marsh sediments and may represent novel lineages of previously undescribed sulfate reducers.

Climate change and the delta,"Dettinger, M.; Anderson, J.; Anderson, M.; Brown, L.R.; Cayan, D.; Maurer, E.","Anthropogenic climate change amounts to a rapidly approaching, ""new"" stressor in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta system. In response to California's extreme natural hydroclimatic variability, complex water-management systems have been developed, even as the Delta's natural ecosystems have been largely devastated. Climate change is projected to challenge these management and ecological systems in different ways that are characterized by different levels of uncertainty. For example, there is high certainty that climate will warm by about 2Â°C more (than late-20th-century averages) by mid-century and about 4Â°C by end of century, if greenhouse-gas emissions continue their current rates of acceleration. Future precipitation changes are much less certain, with as many climate models projecting wetter conditions as drier. However, the same projections agree that precipitation will be more intense when storms do arrive, even as more dry days will separate storms. Warmer temperatures will likely enhance evaporative demands and raise water temperatures. Consequently, climate change is projected to yield both more extreme flood risks and greater drought risks. Sea level rise (SLR) during the 20th century was about 22 cm, and is projected to increase by at least 3-fold this century. SLR together with land subsidence threatens the Delta with greater vulnerabilities to inundation and salinity intrusion. Effects on the Delta ecosystem that are traceable to warming include SLR, reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt and larger storm-driven streamflows, warmer and longer summers, warmer summer water temperatures, and water-quality changes. These changes and their uncertainties will challenge the operations of water projects and uses throughout the Delta's watershed and delivery areas. Although the effects of of climate change on Delta ecosystems may be profound, the end results are difficult to predict, except that native species will fare worse than invaders. Successful preparation for the coming changes will require greater integration of monitoring, modeling, and decision making across time, variables, and space than has been historically normal.

Tidal river dynamics: Implications for deltas,"Hoitink, A.J.F.; Jay, D.A.","Tidal rivers are a vital and little studied nexus between physical oceanography and hydrology. It is only in the last few decades that substantial research efforts have been focused on the interactions of river discharge with tidal waves and storm surges into regions beyond the limit of salinity intrusion, a realm that can extend inland hundreds of kilometers. One key phenomenon resulting from this interaction is the emergence of large fortnightly tides, which are forced long waves with amplitudes that may increase beyond the point where astronomical tides have become extinct. These can be larger than the linear tide itself at more landward locations, and they greatly influence tidal river water levels and wetland inundation. Exploration of the spectral redistribution and attenuation of tidal energy in rivers has led to new appreciation of a wide range of consequences for fluvial and coastal sedimentology, delta evolution, wetland conservation, and salinity intrusion under the influence of sea level rise and delta subsidence. Modern research aims at unifying traditional harmonic tidal analysis, nonparametric regression techniques, and the existing understanding of tidal hydrodynamics to better predict and model tidal river dynamics both in single-thread channels and in branching channel networks. In this context, this review summarizes results from field observations and modeling studies set in tidal river environments as diverse as the Amazon in Brazil, the Columbia, Fraser and Saint Lawrence in North America, the Yangtze and Pearl in China, and the Berau and Mahakam in Indonesia. A description of state-of-the-art methods for a comprehensive analysis of water levels, wave propagation, discharges, and inundation extent in tidal rivers is provided.

Possible climate change and its impact on water supply in California,"Roos, Maurice","Forecasts of historically large climate changes are being made by global climate modelers with warming of 3Â° to 8Â°F (1.5Â° to 4.5Â°C) by the middle of the next century. It is observed that these changes, if they occur, would have a profound impact on California's water resources. A substantial shift in runoff patterns would be expected, with loss of a large fraction of spring snowmelt. This shift would make it difficult or impossible to fill major multipurpose reservoirs once the flood control season is past, with losses in current water project water yields and hydroelectric power.

Ecosystem attributes related to tidal wetland effects on water quality,"Findlay, S.; Fischer, D.","Biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems is central to nutrient cycling, carbon balance, and several ecosystem services, yet it is not always clear why levels of function might vary among systems. Wetlands are widely recognized for their ability to alter concentrations of solutes and particles as water moves through them, but we have only general expectations for what attributes of wetlands are linked to variability in these processes. We examined changes in several water quality variables (dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and suspended particles) to ascertain which constituents are influenced during tidal exchange with a range of 17 tidal freshwater wetlands along the Hudson River, New York, USA. Many of the constituents showed significant differences among wetlands or between flooding and ebbing tidal concentrations, indicating wetland-mediated effects. For dissolved oxygen, the presence of even small proportional cover by submerged aquatic vegetation increased the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water returned to the main channel following a daytime tidal exchange. Nitrate concentrations showed consistent declines during ebbing tides, but the magnitude of decline varied greatly among sites. The proportional cover by graminoiddominated high intertidal vegetation accounted for over 40% of the variation in nitrate decline. Knowing which water-quality alterations are associated with which attributes helps suggest underlying mechanisms and identifies what functions might be susceptible to change as sea level rise or salinity intrusion drives shifts in wetland vegetation cover.

Effects of sea-level rise on bays and estuaries,,"The greenhouse effect and resulting increase in the earthâs temperature may accelerate the mean sea-level rise. The rise of sea level relative to land level is already significant at locations of extreme land subsidence such as coastal Louisiana. The state of the art of our understanding of the relative sea-level rise and its effects on bays and estuaries is reviewed herein. Hydraulic processes, such as tidal range, prism and currents, salinity intrusion, and sedimentation, will be modified. The natural response of bays and estuaries to this rise will include changes in shoreline position, land flooding, and wetlands. The effects on engineering projects and facilities will vary widely according to the design life and site conditions.

Implications of global climatic change and energy cost and availability for the restoration of the Mississippi delta,"Day Jr., J.W.; Barras, J.; Clairain, E.; Johnston, J.; Justic, D.; Kemp, G.P.; Ko, J.-Y.; Lane, R.; Mitsch, W.J.; Steyer, G.; Templet, P.; YaÃ±ez-Arancibia, A.","Over the past several thousand years, inputs from the Mississippi River formed the Mississippi delta, an area of about 25,000 km2. Over the past century, however, there has been a high loss of coastal wetlands of about 4800 km2. The main causes of this loss are the near complete isolation of the river from the delta, mostly due to the construction of flood control levees, and pervasive hydrological disruption of the deltaic plain. There is presently a large-scale State-Federal program to restore the delta that includes construction of water control structures in the flood control levees to divert river water into deteriorating wetlands and pumping of dredged sediment, often for long distances, for marsh creation. Global climate change and decreasing availability and increasing cost of energy are likely to have important implications for delta restoration. Coastal restoration efforts will have to be more intensive to offset the impacts of climate change including accelerated sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns. Future coastal restoration efforts should also focus on less energy-intensive, ecologically engineered management techniques that use the energies of nature as much as possible. Diversions may be as important for controlling salinity as for providing sediments and nutrients for restoring coastal wetlands. Energy-intensive pumping-dredged sediments for coastal restoration will likely become much more expensive in the future. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2005,,Ecol. Eng.,24,4 SPEC.

Impacts of sea-level rise on estuarine circulation: An idealized estuary and San Francisco Bay,"Chua, V.P.; Xu, M.","Estuaries lie at the interface of land and sea, and are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise due to climate change that might lead to intrusion of salt water further upstream and affect circulation patterns. Climate change is also likely to have a major impact on hydrological cycles and consequently lead to changes in freshwater inflows into estuaries. An idealized estuary model is employed to investigate the effects of sea-level rise and freshwater inflows on estuarine circulation. Rising sea levels result in a stronger longitudinal salinity gradient. x, indicating an increase in the strength of the gravitational circulation UGC, higher longitudinal dispersion coefficients K and enhanced salinity intrusion. Under low-flow conditions, the effects of sea level rise on salinity intrusion are largest because sea-level rise has a greater impact due to weaker vertical stratification. Strong flows increase the strength of the gravitational circulation, resulting in higher vertical stratification, which leads to the nonlinear feedback between vertical mixing and stratification. The effect of sea-level rise on salinity intrusion is reduced owing to the suppression of mixing by stratification. Supporting three-dimensional simulations from northern San Francisco Bay are presented. The intrusion length scale L is used as a substitute for regulating inflows to ensure that sufficient fresh water is available to flush the Bay. Following a set of standards explicitly stated in the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord, a series of simulations is performed and we find that with sea-level rise stronger inflows are required to maintain L at the proposed locations.

"Primary production, nutrient dynamics, and accretion of a coastal freshwater forested wetland assimilation system in Louisiana","Brantley, C.G.; Day Jr., J.W.; Lane, R.R.; Hyfield, E.; Day, J.N.; Ko, J.-Y.","This study reports on the response of a tidal, freshwater forested wetland ecosystem to long-term input of secondarily treated municipal effluent from the City of Mandeville, LA. Measurements of hydrology, nutrients, and aboveground net primary productivity were made from September 1998 through March 2002. Accretion measurements were made in October 2000 and October 2004. The major hydrologic inputs to the system were the effluent, precipitation, and back water flooding from Lake Pontchartrain. Nutrient levels were generally low except in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. Mean net primary production of the freshwater forest system was significantly higher downstream of the effluent discharge (1202 g m-2 yr-1) compared to the control site (799 g m-2 yr-1). Downstream of the outfall, accretion rates were double the rate of relative sea level rise in the area. Removal efficiencies of N and P were as high as 75% and 95%, respectively. The relatively constant flow of secondarily treated municipal effluent buffered the downstream area from salinity intrusion during a region-wide drought.

"Estimating salinity effects due to climate change on the Georgia and South Carolina Coasts: Poster session at WQTC 2012, Toronto, ON","Roehl, E.A.; Daamen, R.C.; Cook, J.B.","The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that, in addition to sea level rise, climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and offshore storms, which increase tidal range. AR4 ""is the largest and most detailed summary of the climate change situation ever undertaken, involving thousands of authors from dozens of countries"". It also states that climate change will affect the world's health and macro-scale economies. The need to adapt to future climatic conditions will be especially challenging in coastal regions, where sea level rise, droughts, and increased tides will lead to more frequent and longer duration seawater intrusions into estuaries, affecting drinking water supplies. This paper describes research performed partially under Water Research Foundation Project No. 4285 into how coastal water supplies might be impacted. Two systems that supply fresh water to several municipalities in South Carolina and Georgia were chosen for study - The Lower Savannah River in the vicinity of the City of Savannah, and the Pee Dee / Waccamaw Rivers and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the vicinity of the Grand Strand / Myrtle Beach area. The research used modified versions of estuary models that had originally been developed for other applications. The ""Savannah model"" was developed for predicting salinity intrusion impacts caused by a proposed deepening of Savannah Harbor on the freshwater portion of the Savannah River. As part of the relicensing process for six hydroelectric facilities on the Pee Dee River by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the ""Pee Dee model"" was developed to determine how hydroelectric operations affect salinities at coastal intakes, which had experienced episodes of seawater inundation. Both models have unique features: 1) they were calibrated with 20 years of data that included near-historically low inflows and high sea levels caused by severe droughts and hurricanes like those anticipated from climate change; 2) they were developed using advanced, multivariate, multi-spectral artificial neural network-generated empirical modeling techniques that make them significantly more accurate than conventional mechanistic models over the widely ranging input conditions; and 3) they are deployed as Excelâ¢ spreadsheet programs so that they easily disseminated and used by all stakeholders. The initial models runs were predominantly parametric, i.e., input sea levels and riverine flows are ranged incrementally. AR4 predicts sea level increases of approximately 1/2 to 2 feet, excluding the melting of glacial ice in Greenland and Antarctica. This alone translates into doubling to quadrupling the frequency and duration of seawater intrusion events. The research also includes precipitation change scenarios predicted by a Global Circulation Model (GCM) that were ""downscaled"" to the study regions.

Estuarine response to river flow and sea-level rise under future climate change and human development,"Yang, Z.; Wang, T.; Voisin, N.; Copping, A.","Understanding the response of river flow and estuarine hydrodynamics to climate change, land-use/land-cover change (LULC), and sea-level rise is essential to managing water resources and stress on living organisms under these changing conditions. This paper presents a modeling study using a watershed hydrology model and an estuarine hydrodynamic model, in a one-way coupling, to investigate the estuarine hydrodynamic response to sea-level rise and change in river flow due to the effect of future climate and LULC changes in the Snohomish River estuary, Washington, USA. A set of hydrodynamic variables, including salinity intrusion points, average water depth, and salinity of the inundated area, were used to quantify the estuarine response to river flow and sea-level rise. Model results suggest that salinity intrusion points in the Snohomish River estuary and the average salinity of the inundated areas are a nonlinear function of river flow, although the average water depth in the inundated area is approximately linear with river flow. Future climate changes will shift salinity intrusion points further upstream under low flow conditions and further downstream under high flow conditions. In contrast, under the future LULC change scenario, the salinity intrusion point will shift downstream under both low and high flow conditions, compared to present conditions. The model results also suggest that the average water depth in the inundated areas increases linearly with sea-level rise but at a slower rate, and the average salinity in the inundated areas increases linearly with sea-level rise; however, the response of salinity intrusion points in the river to sea-level rise is strongly nonlinear.

MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF SALINITY INTRUSION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE.,"Lennon, G.P.; Du, B.L.; Wisniewski, G.M.",A rise in sea level will cause saline water to intrude up estuaries including those adjacent to aquifers with major pumping centers.

The objective of this study is to consider various response options that are appropriate to minimize the impact of the salinity intrusion into the Delaware Estuary and adjacent Potomac-Raritan-Magothy aquifer system (PRM) during a drought. Extraction wells and a combination of extraction and injection wells are considered during the drought period.

Can elevated CO 2 modify regeneration from seed banks of floating freshwater marshes subjected to rising sea-level?,"Middleton, B.A.; McKee, K.L.","Higher atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 can offset the negative effects of flooding or salinity on plant species, but previous studies have focused on mature, rather than regenerating vegetation. This study examined how interacting environments of CO 2, water regime, and salinity affect seed germination and seedling biomass of floating freshwater marshes in the Mississippi River Delta, which are dominated by C 3 grasses, sedges, and forbs. Germination density and seedling growth of the dominant species depended on multifactor interactions of CO 2 (385 and 720 Î¼l l -1) with flooding (drained, +8-cm depth, +8-cm depth-gradual) and salinity (0, 6% seawater) levels. Of the three factors tested, salinity was the most important determinant of seedling response patterns. Species richness (total = 19) was insensitive to CO 2. Our findings suggest that for freshwater marsh communities, seedling response to CO 2 is species-specific and secondary to salinity and flooding effects. Elevated CO 2 did not ameliorate flooding or salinity stress. Consequently, climate-related changes in sea level or human-caused alterations in hydrology may override atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in driving shifts in this plant community. The results of this study suggest caution in making extrapolations from species-specific responses to community-level predictions without detailed attention to the nuances of multifactor responses.

Study of salt transport processes in Delaware Bay,"Walters, Roy","The study described here is a subset of a broader climate-related study, and is focused primarily on salinity intrusion into Delaware Bay and River. Given changes in freshwater discharge into the Delaware River as determined from the larger study, and given probable sea level rise estimates, the purpose here is to calculate the distribution of salinity within Delaware Bay and River. The approach adopted for this study is composed of two parts: an analysis of existing physical data in order to derive a basic understanding of the salt dynamics, and numerical simulation of future conditions based on this analysis. There are two important constraints in the model used: it must resolve the spatial scales important to the salt dynamics, and it must be sufficiently efficient to allow extensive sensitivity studies. This has led to the development of a 3D model that uses harmonic decomposition in time and irregular finite elements in space. All nonlinear terms are retained in the governing equations, including quadratic bottom stress, advection, and wave transport (continuity nonlinearity). These equations are coupled to the advection-diffusion equation for salt so that density gradient forcing is included in the momentum equations. Although this study is still in progress, the model has reproduced sea level variations and the 3D structure of tidal and residual currents very well. In addition, the study has addressed the effects of a 1-meter rise in mean sea level on hydrodynamics of the study area.

Spatial variations in a condensed interval between estuarine and open-marine settings: Holocene Hudson River estuary and adjacent continental shelf,"McHugh, C.M.G.; Pekar, S.F.; Christie-Blick, N.; Ryan, W.B.F.; Carbotte, S.; Bell, R.","An interval of stratigraphic condensation extending for 300 km from the fluvially dominated Hudson River estuary to the adjacent continental shelf reveals stratal relationships within an unconformity-related depositional sequence that are commonly difficult to resolve in seismic reflection profiles and outcrop. High-resolution side-scan sonar and bathymetry, more than 100 sediment cores â¼2 m long, and radioisotope (14C,137Cs) age control show that much of the valley was filled by ca. 3 to 1 ka. The present rate of sediment accumulation averages 1 mm/yr, corresponding with a sea-level rise of â¼1.2 mm/yr relative to local bedrock. Condensation is manifested today by sedimentary bypass in most parts of the estuary and by the trapping of available sediment (1.2-5.6 Ã 105 t/yr [metric tons]) along narrow reaches and primarily in the vicinity of the estuarine turbidity maximum, a part of the estuary located upstream of the salinity intrusion â¼25 km from the mouth (3.0 Ã 105 t/yr). Shelf condensation is due to sediment starvation. The condensed interval merges updip with a nascent sequence boundary as the estuary reaches its final filling phase and downdip with the sequence boundary that developed at the Last Glacial Maximum. Delta progradation may take place as available shelf accommodation is filled, but such sediments are expected to be removed once sea level begins to fall. This sedimentation pattern, in which a condensed interval merges with different sequence boundaries, is consistent with the stratigraphic record of the Atlantic margin back to the Paleogene and may be typical of sediment-starved margins.

"Assessment of salinity intrusion in the James and Chickahominy Rivers as a result of simulated sea-level rise in Chesapeake Bay, East Coast, USA","Rice, K.C.; Hong, B.; Shen, J.","Global sea level is rising, and the relative rate in the Chesapeake Bay region of the East Coast of the United States is greater than the worldwide rate. Sea-level rise can cause saline water to migrate upstream in estuaries and rivers, threatening freshwater habitat and drinking-water supplies. The effects of future sea-level rise on two tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, the James and Chickahominy (CHK) Rivers, were evaluated in order to quantify the salinity change with respect to the magnitude of sea-level rise. Such changes are critical to: 1) local floral and faunal habitats that have limited tolerance ranges to salinity; and 2) a drinking-water supply for the City of Newport News, Virginia. By using the three-dimensional Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model (HEM-3D), sea-level rise scenarios of 30, 50, and 100 cm, based on the U.S. Climate Change Science Program for the mid-Atlantic region for the 21st century, were evaluated. The model results indicate that salinity increases in the entire river as sea level rises and that the salinity increase in a dry year is greater than that in a typical year. In the James River, the salinity increase in the middle-to-upper river (from 25 to 50 km upstream of the mouth) is larger than that in the lower and upper parts of the river. The maximum mean salinity increase would be 2 and 4 ppt for a sea-level rise of 50 and 100 cm, respectively. The upstream movement of the 10 ppt isohaline is much larger than the 5 and 20 ppt isohalines. The volume of water with salinity between 10 and 20 ppt would increase greatly if sea level rises 100 cm. In the CHK River, with a sea-level rise of 100 cm, the mean salinity at the drinking-water intake 34 km upstream of the mouth would be about 3 ppt in a typical year and greater than 5 ppt in a dry year, both far in excess of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's secondary standard for total dissolved solids for drinking water. At the drinking-water intake, the number of days of salinity greater than 0.1 ppt increases with increasing sea-level rise; during a dry year, 0.1 ppt would be exceeded for more than 100 days with as small a rise as 30 cm.

"Groundwater, soil moisture, light and weather data collected in a coastal forest bordering a salt marsh in the Delmarva Peninsula (VA)","Nordio, G.; Fagherazzi, S.","Data presented in this paper were collected in eight sites across a coastal forest in the Delmarva Peninsula, VA USA. The sites, located along transects from the marshland to the inner forest, are representative of the progressive forest retreat and the consequent marsh expansion driven by sea level rise. The sites are divided in marsh, transition zone where marsh vegetation is invading the forest, low forest, where tree dieback is widespread, intermediate forest (medium forest), where trees show signs of stress, and high forest, where trees are healthy. Sea level rise and storm surge events are the drivers of the forest conversion to salt marsh. Groundwater level and electrical conductivity were measured in a well at each site. Soil water content and electrical conductivity data were measured in the first 7-cm layer of soil. Weather and light data were collected to determine the effects of external inputs on groundwater and soil moisture datasets and to relate hydrological variables and illuminance to local ecology.

Salinity increases with water table elevation at the boundary between salt marsh and forest,"Nordio, G.; Fagherazzi, S.","The migration of salt marshes into forests along coastal regions is nowadays well documented. Sea level rise and storms threaten coastal forests by increasing groundwater levels and salinity. Salinization is the main cause of forest conversion to salt marsh in North America. In this paper we study groundwater levels and salinity in two wells installed at the border between forest and salt marsh in the lower Delmarva peninsula, USA. The upper well is located in the regenerative forest, where recruitment is still possible, while the lower well is located in the persistent forest, where only mature trees survive. Groundwater in the upper well is fresh at the root depth, while in the lower well the mean salinity is 8 ppt. Our data suggest that rainfall has an instantaneous effect on salinity and groundwater levels, but it does not affect salinity and groundwater levels on longer periods (weeks to months). Groundwater levels and salinity reflect the hydraulic gradient toward the marsh (a proxy for outgoing water fluxes), the uphill hydraulic gradient (a proxy for incoming water fluxes) and temperature (a proxy for evapotranspiration). Salinity increases when groundwater levels are high. To explain this result, we put forward the hypothesis that a high water table favors the flux of surficial, fresh water to the marsh, and loss of freshwater by evapotranspiration. These losses are likely replenished by saltier water moving at depth. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,J.

Modulation of the intestinal barrier adaptive functions in red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) invading brackish waters,"Ding, L.; Li, W.; Liang, L.; Huang, Z.; Li, N.; Zhang, J.; Shi, H.; Storey, K.B.; Hong, M.","Globally, the increase in sea levels is leading to salinization of freshwater, which might influence the freshwater organisms such as red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans. The turtle can invade brackish water environments, in which it must deal with elevated salinity in the gastrointestinal tract that could impact the intestinal function. The intestinal barrier provides a front-line of organismal defense against the chemical and biological environmental insults. In this study, the adaptive functions of the intestinal barrier including intestinal histomorphology, genes involved in intestinal barrier functions, and the intestinal micro-ecosystem were analyzed in the turtles exposed to freshwater (S0), 5â° salinity (S5) and 15â° salinity (S15) water for 30 days. The results showed that the intestine of T. s. elegans maintained normal histomorphological structure in the S5 group, whereas the villus height, crypt depth and the number of goblet cells in the S15 group were lower than that in the S5 and S0 groups. In addition, the relative expression levels of epithelial tight junction-related genes and intestinal immune-related genes in the gut were significantly upregulated in the S15 group, compared to the freshwater group. Mucin-2 gene expression was downregulated, but mucin-1 transcript levels were upregulated in salinity-treated groups. Furthermore, the abundances of phylum Proteobacteria, and genera Morganella and Aeromonas in the intestine were particularly enhanced in the S15 group than the S0 and S5 groups. Taken together, these results indicate that the intestinal barrier plays a protective role in T. s. elegans adaptation to brackish water environments. Our results provide a perspective on the evolution of salinity tolerance and help to evaluate the potential danger of the turtle to other species, and understand the challenges that other species must meet with rising sea levels.

"Declines of methylmercury along a salinity gradient in a low-lying coastal wetland ecosystem at South Carolina, USA","Ulus, Y.; Tsui, M.T.-K.; Sakar, A.; Nyarko, P.; Aitmbarek, N.B.; ArdÃ³n, M.; Chow, A.T.","Wetlands are widely regarded as biogeochemical hotspots of highly toxic methylmercury (MeHg), mainly mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria. In low-lying coastal wetlands, sea level rise, a phenomenon caused by global climate change, is slowly degrading numerous healthy freshwater forested wetlands into salt-degraded counterparts with a nickname âghost forestsâ, and eventually converting them to saltmarshes. However, little is known about the changes of mercury (Hg) methylation, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification along the forest-to-saltmarsh gradient. Here, we conducted extensive field sampling in three wetland states (healthy forested wetlands, salt-degraded forested wetlands, and saltmarsh) along a salinity gradient (from 0 to 9.4 ppt) in Winyah Bay, South Carolina, USA. We found that in our study wetland systems the saltmarshes had the lowest levels of both total Hg and MeHg in sediments and biota, as compared to healthy forested wetlands and saltwater-degraded ghost forests. Our results suggest that the slow conversion of forested wetland to saltmarsh could reduce net MeHg production in our study wetland systems, which we hypothesized that could be attributed to increased sulfate reduction and excessive buildup of sulfide in sediment that inhibits microbial Hg methylation, and/or reduced canopy density and increased photodegradation of MeHg. However, it should be noted that biogeochemical MeHg responses to salinity changes may be site-specific and we urge more similar studies in other wetland systems along a salinity gradient. Therefore, long-term salinization of coastal wetlands and the slow conversion of forests to marshes could decrease long-term exposure of toxic MeHg levels in coastal food webs that are similar to our system, and ultimately reduce human exposure to this neurotoxin.

Plot-based vegetation sampling and dendrochronology were employed to examine: (1) downriver shifts in plant community composition and the structure of canopy trees, understory trees/saplings/shrubs and herbs, tree basal-area increment (BAI) and (2) interannual variability in BAI from 2015 dating back as far as 1969 in relation to long-term river and estuary monitoring data. With greater tidal influence downstream, tree species dominance shifted, live basal area generally decreased, long-term mean BAI of individual trees decreased, woody stem mortality increased, and live herbaceous vegetative cover and richness increased. Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Ilex opaca, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica dominated NT and UT sites, with F. pennsylvanica and Nyssa sylvatica increasingly dominating at more downstream tidal sites. Annual tree BAI growth was positively affected by nontidal river flow at NT and UT sites which were closer to the head-of-tide, positively influenced by small salinity increases at LT and ST sites further downstream, and positively influenced by estuarine water level throughout the gradient; nutrient influence was site specific with both positive and negative influences. The counterintuitive finding of salinity increasing tree growth at sites with low BAI is likely due to either competitive growth release from neighboring tree death or enhanced soil nutrient availability that may temporarily mitigate the negative effects of low-level salinization and sea-level increases on living TFFW canopy trees, even as overall plant community conversion to tidal marsh progresses.

Trade-off between microbial carbon use efficiency and microbial phosphorus limitation under salinization in a tidal wetland,"Zhai, Z.; Luo, M.; Yang, Y.; Liu, Y.; Chen, X.; Zhang, C.; Huang, J.; Chen, J.","Sea level riseâinduced salinization is projected to influence the decomposition of soil carbon (C) in tidal wetlands. Despite evidence showing that microbial metabolism can determine the fate of soil C decomposition, the response of microbial metabolism to salinization in tidal wetlands remains largely unknown. Microbial metabolism is impacted by the microbial metabolic limitation and carbon use efficiency (CUE), which can provide mechanistic insights into soil C decomposition. Here, we measured microbial metabolic limitation, microbial CUE, and extracellular enzyme activities along an estuarine salinity gradient ranging from freshwater (0.1 Â± 0.1 mg gâ1) to oligohaline (2.1 Â± 0.5 mg gâ1) in a tidal wetland. Overall, microorganisms were limited by phosphorus (P) in the tidal wetlands, where salinization increased microbial P limitation by 34%. The enhanced microbial P limitation was attributed to increases in soil C:P and belowground biomass, as well as decreases in root C:P with increasing salinity. Microbial CUE decreased from 0.38 to 0.33 as salinity increased, while microbial P limitation was negatively correlated with microbial CUE, representing the trade-off between the two. Furthermore, microbial P limitation was positively associated with C-, nitrogen (N)-, and P-acquiring extracellular enzyme activities, while all these enzyme activities were negatively correlated with microbial CUE. These results illustrate that to balance microbial P limitation with salinization, microorganisms transfer more energy from the microbial CUE to extracellular enzyme production, and this was the mechanism underlying the trade-off. Microorganisms were also limited by C in the tidal wetlands. However, as the increasing belowground biomass alleviated microbial C limitation with salinization, no relationship was observed between microbial C limitation and CUE. Future C and nutrient models aimed to simulate tidal wetland ecosystem responses to salinization will benefit from the inclusion of trade-off between microbial CUE and microbial P limitation for more accurate prediction.

Low-salinity transitions drive abrupt microbial response to sea-level change,"Whittle, A.; Barnett, R.L.; Charman, D.J.; Gallego-Sala, A.V.","The salinisation of many coastal ecosystems is underway and is expected to continue into the future because of sea-level rise and storm intensification brought about by the changing climate. However, the response of soil microbes to increasing salinity conditions within coastal environments is poorly understood, despite their importance for nutrient cascading, carbon sequestration and wider ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate deterioration in the productivity of a top-tier microbial group (testate amoebae) with increasing coastal salinity, which we show to be consistent across phylogenetic groups, salinity gradients, environment types and latitude. Our results show that microbial changes occur in the very early stages of marine inundation, presaging more radical changes in soil and ecosystem function and providing an early warning of coastal salinisation that could be used to improve coastal planning and adaptation.

Distance to coastline modulates morphology and population structure in a coastal amphibian,"Lorrain-Soligon, L.; Robin, F.; Lelong, V.; Jankovic, M.; Barbraud, C.; Brischoux, F.","Salinization due to sea-level rise and marine submersions is expected to strongly impact coastal ecosystems. Exposure to salinity can negatively impact biodiversity especially in coastal wetlands. To understand comprehensively the consequences of environmental salinization on coastal biodiversity, it is essential to document how coastal species currently respond to exposure to salinity. In this study, we investigated how variations of environmental salinity relative to the distance to the ocean influence population structure (age ratio and sex ratio), and individual hydro-mineral balance (osmolality) and morphology (size, mass, condition) in the western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) in two populations from the French Atlantic coast. We show that distance to coastline strongly influences exposure to salt on a small spatial scale. Some variables (e.g., abundances, osmolality, morphology) responded similarly in both sites and may be related to salt deposition due to landward sea-spray. Interestingly, other variables (sex ratio and age ratio) displayed site-specific responses and appeared to be linked to the salinity of breeding sites. Distance to the shoreline appears to be a critical population structuring factor in this coastal salt-tolerant species. Future studies should investigate how distance to shoreline- A nd thus environmental salinity-can ultimately affect individual performances and fitness.  Â© 2022 The Author(s).

Forced displacement and climate change: Time for global governance,"McCarney, R.; Kent, J.","Climate change and its relatively slow-onset effects like sea level rise, desertification, and water salinization and associated sudden onset effects like floods, hurricanes and droughts, is perhaps the major emerging risk to rich and poor nations and the most vulnerable people within them. But the current system of global governance is entirely insufficient to cope with, let alone effectively respond to, the looming crisis of climate displacement. This policy brief discusses the current state of the global governance of climate displacement and identifies a number of substantive and organizational legal and policy elements in need of rapid implementation and development.

Salinisation effects on freshwater macrophyte growth and establishment in coastal eutrophic agricultural ditches,"Velthuis, M.; Teurlincx, S.; van Dijk, G.; Smolders, A.J.P.; de SenerpontÂ Domis, L.N.","The presence of submerged macrophytes is a desired environmental target for coastal freshwater ecosystems. Maintaining a rich community of these species can be challenging as salinisation by sea-level rise poses an increasing threat to ecosystem integrity. We tested the effect of salinisation on the growth and germination of freshwater macrophytes experimentally using field sediment. In a 56-day experiment, a macrophyte community was exposed to salinity treatments representing seasonal water management scenarios (a decreasing salinity from 1,500 to 300 mg NaCl/L, a stable salinity of 300 mg NaCl/L, an increasing salinity from 300 to 1,500 mg NaCl/L and a stable salinity of 1,500 mg NaCl/L), crossed with treatments simulating periodic turbidity pulses. All species except Elodea nuttallii grew poorly on the saline and eutrophic sediment, reflecting the challenges of growth in eutrophic coastal systems. Surprisingly, the highest community biomass was achieved in the salinity scenario of 1,500 mg NaCl/L. In a second experiment, field-collected sediments were incubated at 300 and 1,500 mg NaCl/L salinity (representing summer and winter scenarios), and the germination capacity of the existing seedbank was quantified. Most germinated seedlings did not reach maturity irrespective of salinity treatment. This indicated that sediment salinity, rather than water column salinity, determined seedling establishment success. Interestingly, the established species were characteristic of freshwater habitats, thus indicating maladaptation of the seedbank. Our results show that a mismatch between the high salinity level of eutrophic sediment and the overlaying freshwater may hamper macrophyte growth. Furthermore, target species in coastal eutrophic freshwaters should be evaluated carefully. Elodea nuttalli, which has a wide tolerance range for nutrients and salinity, outperformed other macrophyte species in our study. Thus, species with similar traits may be most successful in establishing macrophyte stands in coastal eutropic wetlands. Â© 2023 The Authors.

Surface Water-Groundwater Connections as Pathways for Inland Salinization of Coastal Aquifers,"Hingst, M.C.; McQuiggan, R.W.; Peters, C.N.; He, C.; Andres, A.S.; Michael, H.A.","Coastal agricultural zones are experiencing salinization due to accelerating rates of sea-level rise, causing reduction in crop yields and abandonment of farmland. Understanding mechanisms and drivers of this seawater intrusion (SWI) is key to mitigating its effects and predicting future vulnerability of groundwater resources to salinization. We implemented a monitoring network of pressure and specific conductivity (SC) sensors in wells and surface waters to target marsh-adjacent agricultural areas in greater Dover, Delaware. Recorded water levels and SC over a period of three years show that the mechanisms and timescales of SWI are controlled by local hydrology, geomorphology, and geology. Monitored wells did not indicate widespread salinization of deep groundwater in the surficial aquifer. However, monitored surface water bodies and shallow (<4 m deep) wells did show SC fluctuations due to tides and storm events, in one case leading to salinization of deeper (18 m deep) groundwater. Seasonal peaks in SC occurred during late summer months. Seasonal and interannual variation of SC was also influenced by relative sea level. The data collected in this study data highlight the mechanisms by which surface water-groundwater connections lead to salinization of aquifers inland, before SWI is detected in deeper groundwater nearer the coastline. Sharing of our data with stakeholders has led to the implementation of SWI mitigation efforts, illustrating the importance of strategic monitoring and stakeholder engagement to support coastal resilience.

Intangible cultural heritage: a benefit to climate-displaced and host communities,"AktÃ¼rk, G.; Lerski, M.","Climate change is borderless, and its impacts are not shared equally by all communities. It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives.

"Sea-level rise, localized subsidence, and increased storminess promote saltmarsh transgression across low-gradient upland areas","Miller, C.B.; Rodriguez, A.B.; Bost, M.C.","Saltmarsh area is decreasing globally from natural and anthropogenic stressors. Accelerating relative sea-level rise (SLR) is projected to exacerbate losses if not offset by upland saltmarsh migration (transgression). In the absence of coastal upland development, saltmarsh transgression rates increase with accelerating SLR and lower upland surface gradients. Storm wind and surge stress coastal upland forests causing defoliation, uprooting, and soil salinization, which makes upland areas more habitable for saltmarsh species and can promote transgression. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of storms to saltmarsh transgression by reconstructing transgression rates over the past 600 years during stormy and non-stormy conditions and fast and slow SLR rates. Our reconstructions are based on the stratigraphic record and historical aerial photography at three sites in North Carolina, U.S.A. where low-gradient pocosin upland grades into expansive saltmarsh. When sea level was rising <0.9 mm yrâ1, saltmarsh transgression rates at the two sites where saltmarsh is > 100 years were an average of 2 and 10 times faster during a paleo-stormy period (1400â1675 CE) than a subsequent non-stormy period. After 1865 CE when SLR accelerated to 2.4 mm yrâ1, transgression rates were an average of 7 times faster than the preceding slow SLR non-stormy period. The two sites where the historical record was not confounded by dredging show transgression was 7 times faster and saltmarsh areas increased an average of 28% during stormy decades than non-stormy decades; however, the rate of transgression only increased at the site with greatest surge during the stormy period characterized by strong northeast winds. Modeled transgression rates, using the paleo-upland slope and a sea level curve, do not match observed transgression rates for the paleo-stormy and rapid SLR periods. Furthermore, the thickness of saltmarsh peat younger than 1957 CE is greater than what would be predicted from independent records of SLR. Changes in the elevation of the upland surface, which is composed of peat, contributes to the disparity between predicted and observed transgression rates. The upland surface elevation can keep pace with some rates of SLR through vertical accretion; however, salinization and decomposition of upland vegetation from storm surge plus SLR decreases the elevation of the paleo-upland surface and increases accommodation and transgression rates. Along low-gradient coastlines with pocosin upland areas, SLR, subsidence, and storminess are coupled in modulating transgression rates and those processes need to be included in forecasts of saltmarsh response to climate change.

Asymmetric root distributions reveal pressâpulse responses in retreating coastal forests,"Messerschmidt, T.C.; Langston, A.K.; Kirwan, M.L.","The impacts of climate change on ecosystems are manifested in how organisms respond to episodic and continuous stressors. The conversion of coastal forests to salt marshes represents a prominent example of ecosystem state change, driven by the continuous stress of sea-level rise (press), and episodic storms (pulse). Here, we measured the rooting dimension and fall direction of 143 windthrown eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) trees in a rapidly retreating coastal forest in Chesapeake Bay (USA). We found that tree roots were distributed asymmetrically away from the leading edge of soil salinization and towards freshwater sources. The length, number, and circumference of roots were consistently higher in the upslope direction than downslope direction, suggesting an active morphological adaptation to sea-level rise and salinity stress. Windthrown trees consistently fell in the upslope direction regardless of aspect and prevailing wind direction, suggesting that asymmetric rooting destabilized standing trees, and reduced their ability to withstand high winds. Together, these observations help explain curious observations of coastal forest resilience, and highlight an interesting nonadditive response to climate change, where adaptation to press stressors increases vulnerability to pulse stressors.

Coastal Groundwater Flow at the Nearshore and Embayment Scales: A Field and Modeling Study,"Evans, T.B.; White, S.M.; Wilson, A.M.","Knowledge of coastal groundwater flow is critical for managing coastal groundwater resources and quantifying submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), but this flow occurs over multiple scales that can be difficult to study in an integrated way. We designed a field and modeling study to investigate groundwater flow and the distribution of salinity during sea level rise in a domain that included beaches, salt marshes and the first major confined aquifer, which reached 10â15Â km offshore. Numerical models were based on the flat-lying, passive margin coastline of North Inlet, SC, and were constrained by field studies including subsurface resistivity surveys and hydraulic head observations. Simulations that included tidal fluctuations showed that the salt marsh generated more than three times as much SGD as the beach and inner shelf, per unit length of coastline. Groundwater exchange between scales was small, suggesting that physical fluxes of groundwater can be considered independently at different scales. However, salinization of the first major confined aquifer occurred by downward transport from overlying aquifers rather than intrusion from the seaward end, suggesting that studies of aquifer salinization should consider multiscale flow. During simulated sea level rise, fresh-to-brackish groundwater persisted in the first confined aquifer as far as the seaward end of the overlying confining unit, 10â20Â km offshore. Total fluxes of SGD decreased significantly with future sea level rise, dominated by declining SGD in the salt marsh, and portending a marked decline in the flux of nutrients and carbon to estuaries and the coastal ocean.

Salt-tolerant plant moderates the effect of salinity on soil organic carbon mineralization in a subtropical tidal wetland,"Chen, X.; Luo, M.; Tan, J.; Zhang, C.; Liu, Y.; Huang, J.; Tan, Y.; Xiao, L.; Xu, Z.","Although salinization is widely known to affect cycling of soil carbon (C) in tidal freshwater wetlands, the role of the presence or absence of plants in mediating the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization to salinization is poorly understood. In this study, we translocated soils collected from a tidal freshwater wetland to sites with varying salinities along a subtropical estuarine gradient and established unplanted and planted (with the salt-tolerant plant Cyperus malaccensis Lam.) mesocosms at each site. We simultaneously investigated cumulative soil CO2 emissions, C-acquiring enzyme activities, availability of labile organic C (LOC), and structures of bacterial and fungal communities. Overall, in the planted mesocosm, the soil LOC content and the activities of Î²-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase increased with salinization. However, in the unplanted mesocosm, soil LOC content decreased with increasing salinity, whereas all the C-acquiring enzyme activities did not change. In addition, salinization favored the dominance of bacterial and fungal copiotrophs (e.g., Î³-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota) in the planted mesocosms. Contrarily, in the unplanted mesocosms salinization favored bacterial and fungal oligotrophs (e.g., Î±-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Basidiomycota). In both planted and unplanted mesocosms, cumulative soil CO2 emissions were affected by soil LOC content, activities of C-acquiring enzymes, and microbial C-use trophic strategies. Overall, cumulative soil CO2 emissions increased by 35% with increasing salinity in the planted mesocosm but decreased by 37% as salinity increased in the unplanted mesocosm. Our results demonstrate that the presence or absence of salt-tolerant plants can moderate the effect of salinity on SOC mineralization in tidal wetland soils. Future C prediction models should embed both planted and unplanted modules to accurately simulate cycling of soil C in tidal wetlands under sea level rise. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Sci.

Influence of Climate and Coastal Flooding on Eastern Red Cedar Growth along a Marsh-Forest Ecotone,"Hall, S.; Stotts, S.; Haaf, L.","Coastal forests in the Mid-Atlantic region are threatened by sea level rise through chronic and episodic salinization and hydrologic alterations, leading to inland marsh migration and the occurrence of ghost forests. This study uses dendrochronology to explore the impact of rising sea level on the annual growth of Juniperus virginiana (the Eastern red cedar) at the St. Jones component of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve in Dover, DE. Chronologies from low and high elevations were developed, and a difference chronology (highâlow) was generated. A rapid field assessment of tree stress indicated greater stress in low elevation trees, and low elevation soil tests showed higher soil moisture and salt content compared to samples from high elevation. Ring width indices were analyzed in relation to water level, precipitation, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and temperature, with Pearsonâs correlation analysis. Trees growing at low elevation showed greater climate sensitivity and responded favorably to cool, wet summers. Over time, correlations between growth and climate variables decreased, while negative correlations with tidal water level increasedâa pattern that presented nearly a decade earlier in the low elevation system. Given the widespread distribution of the Eastern red cedar and its sensitivity to changes in sea level, this species may be particularly useful as a sentinel of change in coastal landscapes as sea levels rise.

Adaptive responses to salinity stress across multiple life stages in anuran amphibians,"Albecker, M.A.; McCoy, M.W.","Background: In many regions, freshwater wetlands are increasing in salinity at rates exceeding historic levels. Some freshwater organisms, like amphibians, may be able to adapt and persist in salt-contaminated wetlands by developing salt tolerance. Yet adaptive responses may be more challenging for organisms with complex life histories, because the same environmental stressor can require responses across different ontogenetic stages. Here we investigated responses to salinity in anuran amphibians: a common, freshwater taxon with a complex life cycle. We conducted a meta-analysis to define how the lethality of saltwater exposure changes across multiple life stages, surveyed wetlands in a coastal region experiencing progressive salinization for the presence of anurans, and used common garden experiments to investigate whether chronic salt exposure alters responses in three sequential life stages (reproductive, egg, and tadpole life stages) in Hyla cinerea, a species repeatedly observed in saline wetlands. Results: Meta-analysis revealed differential vulnerability to salt stress across life stages with the egg stage as the most salt-sensitive. Field surveys revealed that 25% of the species known to occur in the focal region were detected in salt-intruded habitats. Remarkably, Hyla cinerea was found in large abundances in multiple wetlands with salinity concentrations 450% higher than the tadpole-stage LC50. Common garden experiments showed that coastal (chronically salt exposed) populations of H. cinerea lay more eggs, have higher hatching success, and greater tadpole survival in higher salinities compared to inland (salt naÃ¯ve) populations. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that some species of anuran amphibians have divergent and adaptive responses to salt exposure across populations and across different life stages. We propose that anuran amphibians may be a novel and amenable natural model system for empirical explorations of adaptive responses to environmental change. Â© 2017 The Author(s).",2017,,Front.

The influence of salinization on seed germination and plant growth under mono and polyculture,"VenÃ¢ncio, C.; Pereira, R.; Lopes, I.","Sea level rise induced-salinization is lowering coastal soils productivity. In order to assess the effects that increased salinity may provoke in terrestrial plants, using as model species: Trifolium pratense, Lolium perenne, Festuca arundinacea and Vicia sativa, two specific objectives were targeted: i) to determine the sensitivity of the selected plant species to increased salinity (induced by seawater-SW or by NaCl, proposed as a surrogate of SW) and, ii) to assess the influence of salinization in total biomass under different agricultural practices (mono- or polycultures). The four plant species exhibited a higher sensitivity to NaCl than to SW. Festuca arundinacea was the most tolerant species to NaCl (EC50,seed germination and EC50,growth of 18.6 and 10.5 mScmâ1, respectively). The other three species presented effective conductivities in the same order of magnitude and, in general, with 95% confidence limits overlapping. Soil moistened with SW caused no significant adverse effects on seed germination and growth of L. perenne. Similar to NaCl, the other three species, in general, presented a similar sensitivity to SW exposure with EC50,seed germination and EC50,growth within the same order of magnitude and with confidence limits overlapping. The agricultural practice (mono-vs polyculture) showed some influence on the biomass of each plant species. When considering total productivity, for aerial and root biomass, it was higher in control comparatively to salinization conditions. Under salinization stress, the practice of polyculture was associated with a higher aerial and root total biomass than monocultures (for instance with combinations with T. pratense and F. arundinacea).Results suggest that the effects of salinity stress on total productivity may be minimized under agricultural practices of polyculture. Thus, this type of cultures should be encouraged in low-lying coastal ecosystems that are predicted to suffer from salinization caused by seawater intrusions. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Environ.

Changes in salinity of a clay soil after a short-term salt water flood event,"Taylor, M.; KrÃ¼ger, N.","The effects and subsequent recovery from a short-term salt water flood event were studied on a clay soil. Sea inundation of agricultural land caused marine salt water to pond on the soil surface for up to 144 h. The salinity of the soil, how deeply the salt water penetrated into the soil and how quickly salts washed out of the soil were assessed. Elevated salt content was seen most strongly in the top layer (0â2 cm) of the soil and salt concentrations increased with the length of inundation. Maize crops died if inundated for 24 h or more, while ryegrass pasture died after an inundation period of 36 h or more. Flushing of soil particles with fresh rainwater proved effective at lowering the salt content in the top 2 cm of soil. The salt content was considerably lower after one rainfall event of 35 mm and decreased only slightly more after another 165 mm of rain. The combined effect of sea level rise and land subsidence may enhance saltwater contamination and soil salinisation with potential serious environmental and socio-economic impacts, e.g. compromising agriculture. Using salt tolerant grasses as pasture species in these low-lying areas should be further investigated.

Salinization effects on coastal ecosystems: A terrestrial model ecosystem approach,"Pereira, C.S.; Lopes, I.; Abrantes, I.; Sousa, J.P.; Chelinho, S.","In coastal areas, intrusion/irrigation with seawater can threaten biodiversity along with crop yields, and the leaching of salts from areas affected by these processes can increase the salinity of water bodies nearby. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of salinization on coastal soil ecosystems due to saline intrusion/irrigation. Terrestrial model ecosystems were used to simulate two soil salinization scenarios: (i) seawater intrusion and irrigation with distilled water and (ii) seawater intrusion and irrigation with saline water. Three sampling periods were established: T0âafter acclimation period; T1âsalinization effects; and T2âpopulationsâ recovery. In each sampling period, the abundance of nematodes, enchytraeids, springtails, mites and earthworms, and plant biomass were measured. Immediate negative effects on enchytraeid abundance were detected, especially at the higher level of saltwater via intrusionÃ¾irrigation. Eight weeks after the cessation of saline irrigation, the abundance of enchytraeids fully recovered, and some delayed effects were observed in earthworm abundance and plant biomass, especially at the higher soil conductivity level. The observed low capacity of soil to retain salts suggests that, particularly at high soil conductivities, nearby freshwater bodies can also be endangered. Under saline conditions similar to the ones assayed, survival of some soil communities can be threatened, leading to the loss of biodiversity.

Salinity-induced increase of the hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone of coastal wetlands,"van Dijk, G.; Nijp, J.J.; Metselaar, K.; Lamers, L.P.M.; Smolders, A.J.P.","In coastal zones globally, salinization is rapidly taking place due to the combined effects of sea level rise, land subsidence, altered hydrology, and climate change. Although increased salinity levels are known to have a great impact on both biogeochemical and hydrological processes in aquatic sediments, only few studies have included both types of processes and their potential interactions. In the present paper, we used a controlled 3-year experimental mesocosm approach to test salinity induced interactions and discuss mechanisms explaining the observed hydrological changes. Surface water salinity was experimentally increased from 14 to 140 mmol Cl per L (0.9 and 9 PSU) by adding sea salt which increased pore water salinity but also increased sulfate reduction rates, leading to higher sulfide, and lower methane concentrations. By analyzing slug test data with different slug test analysis methods, we were able to show that hydraulic conductivity of the hyporheic zone increased 2.8 times by salinization. Based on our hydrological and biogeochemical measurements, we conclude that the combination of pore dilation and decreased methane production rates were major controls on the observed increase in hydraulic conductivity. The slug test analysis method comparison allowed to conclude that the adjusted Bouwer and Rice method results in the most reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity for hyporheic zones. Our work shows that both physical and biogeochemical processes are vital to explain and predict hydrological changes related to the salinization of hyporheic zones in coastal wetlands and provides a robust methodological approach for doing so.

Effects of climate change on the use of wastewater for aquaculture practices,"Adhikari, S.; Mandal, R.N.","Higher water temperature, sea-level rise and lower precipitation are the manifestations of climate change. Higher temperatures of water and changes in extreme events, like floods and droughts, are responsible for affecting water quality. These extreme events can also pollute water from different sources, like sediments, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, salt and thermal incidence. This polluted water can have negative impacts on ecosystems, human health, water system reliability, etc. In addition, sea-level rise is responsible for extending the areas of groundwater salinization and estuaries, which can decrease the availability of freshwater for humans and ecosystem in coastal areas. With anticipated higher temperature, the quality of wastewater could be very poor. Higher water temperature will facilitate the excessive growth of algal bloom in wastewater which will in turn reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration. Higher temperature will also increase the biological activity of wastewater; the growth of microbial population will be more, which will increase the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater. Because of higher temperature, the organic matter decomposition could increase, and thereby the release of nutrients, viz. nitrogen and phosphorus, will be more in water, which will in turn increase the chance of eutrophication of wastewater. At the same time, the availability of heavy metals and pesticides present in the wastewater could be more to the organisms cultured in the wastewater. If the chance of rainfall is in excess amount, then the wastewater will be diluted, and all the negative qualities of wastewater will be reduced, and the use of the wastewater will be of no problem for aquaculture and agriculture practices. However, if the precipitation reduces particularly in tropics as predicted because of climate change, then the chance of deterioration of wastewater quality will be more. Thus, the operational cost for the wastewater use for aquaculture purposes will be more. In the present paper, these aspects of wastewater use for aquaculture purposes have been discussed.

Comparing Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI in soil salinity detection: a case study of agricultural lands in coastal North Carolina,"Davis, E.; Wang, C.; Dow, K.","This study presents the first comparison of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in identifying soil salinity using soil physiochemical, spectral, statistical, and image analysis techniques. By the end of the century, intermediate sea level rise scenarios project approximately 1.3 meters of sea level rise along the coast of the southeastern United States. One of the most vulnerable areas is Hyde County, North Carolina, where 1140 km2 of agricultural lands are being salinized, endangering 4,200 people and $40 million USD of property. To determine the best multispectral sensor to map the extent of salinization, this study compared the feasibility of OLI and MSI to estimate electrical conductivity (EC). The EC of field samples were correlated with handheld spectrometer spectra resampled into multispectral sensor bands. Using an iterative ordinary least squares regression, it was found that EC was sensitive to OLI bands 2 (452Â nmâ512Â nm) and 4 (636Â nmâ673Â nm) and MSI bands 2 (457.5Â nmâ522.5Â nm) and 4 (650Â nmâ680Â nm). Respectively, the R2Adj and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04â0.54 and 1.15 for OLI, and 0.05â0.67 and 1.17 for MSI, suggests that the two sensors have similar salinity modelling skill. The extracted saline soils make up approximately 1,703Â hectares for OLI and 118Â hectares for MSI, indicating overestimation from the OLI image due to its coarser spatial resolution. Additionally, field samples indicate that nearby vegetated land is saline, indicating an underestimation of total impacted land. As sea levels rise, accurately monitoring soil salinization will be critical to protecting coastal agricultural lands. MSIâs spatial and temporal resolution makes it superior to OLI for salinity tracking though they have roughly equivalent spectral resolutions. This study demonstrates that visible spectral bands are sensitive to soil salinity with the Blue and Red spectral ranges producing the highest model accuracy; however, the low accuracies for both sensors indicate the need of narrowband sensors. The HyspIRI to be launched in the early 2020s by NASA may provide ideal data source in soil salinity studies. Â© 2019, Â© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,,Int. J.

Implications of Sea Level Rise for Bee Communities in Rural Eastern Virginia Coastal Habitats,"Thuma, J.; Roulston, T.; Blum, L.","In the coastal mid-Atlantic region of the USA, landscapes are a mosaic of upland habitats (woodland, grassland, old fields and farmland) and low-lying coastal salt marsh. Flooding and salinization of coastal areas due to sea-level rise result in the conversion of upland habitats to salt marsh, and change the relative proportion of habitat types surrounding coastal farmland. This has the potential to influence population sizes of organisms living in this area and could alter the ecosystem services, such as pollination, that these habitats provide. To examine the potential outcome of these habitat conversions, we used blue vane traps at 14 sites along the Eastern Shore of Virginia (USA) to compare the bee communities of salt marsh, old fields and agricultural fields. Although there was no difference among habitat types for total bee abundance per site, we found that the coastal marsh is depauperate in bee species relative to old fields and agricultural fields, and that the bee species using the marsh habitat tend to be specialists of plant families that are common in the marsh (Asteraceae and Malvaceae) but are relatively uncommon in local agriculture. Thus, the transition of upland areas to marsh not only has the potential to impact agricultural productivity directly through salt water intrusion, ultimately it may also reduce the species richness of native bees available to provide pollination services to coastal agriculture.

Climate change and tourism - some key issues,"Blagoeva, I.","Tourism is very vulnerable to climate change. Threats to the sector - direct and indirect - are also increasing extreme weather events, increased costs for insurance and security, water shortages, loss of biodiversity and damage or loss of attractions in tourist places. A study by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2016 showed that today, approximately 40% of countries that have prepared national commitments (NDC) recognize tourism either as a priority in their mitigation and adaptation strategies, or as a sector vulnerable to climate change. Climate is often a decisive factor when choosing a tourist destination, whether it is a mild, warm climate for outdoor activities or a cold, snowy climate for skiing. Thus, climate change threatens to change the quality of many tourist destinations around the world. Tourism of small islands, reefs and ski areas is particularly affected by climate change. Tourism, the world's largest industry, also contributes to climate change. About half of the world's air travel is in tourism, and aviation accounts for about 2-3% of all anthropogenic (anthropogenic) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and about 13% of anthropogenic emissions. As the climate warms, climatic zones favorable for tourism will shift towards the poles. Areas that are now comfortable may become too hot. For example, the tourism industry suffered in southern France during the unprecedented European heat of 2003, and such extreme weather events are likely to become more common with global warming. Islands that are no longer above water and reefs that are bleached and lifeless cease to generate tourism income. Losses in the ski industry have already occurred in Austria, Chile, the eastern United States and Switzerland, as winters are shrinking and thaws are becoming more common. Glacier National Park in the United States is likely to be glacier free by 2030. Tourism is the main economic engine for many small islands, where sea level rise due to global warming is projected to accelerate beach erosion, worsen coastal defenses such as coral reefs, and increase the salinization of coastal wells that many island resorts depend on. 1190 islands of the Maldives archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which is one of the main places for beach and underwater tourism, are on average only 39 inches (1 m) above sea level, which is consistent with the range of possible sea level rise by 2100 and will almost certainly be exceeded in the next century or so.

"Seasonal Salinity Variations in a Coastal Wetland Induced by Complex Interactions Between Sea, River and Evapoconcentration Processes","Mastrocicco, M.; Busico, G.; Colombani, N.; Usai, A.; Ruberti, D.","Deltaic coastal areas are often formed by a piecemeal of transitional wetland environments. These environments consist of wetland-aquifer systems, which commonly react rapidly to climate changes. Direct evaporation from surface water bodies like lakes, wetlands and lagoons will increase due to temperature increase leading to salt accumulation. To understand the hydrological exchanges between the transitional coastal wetlands of the Variconi oasis, the unconfined aquifer of the Volturno River Delta and the Tyrrenian Sea, the contributions of various processes were monitored and assessed. Physical-chemical parameters like salinity, pH, Eh and temperature were monitored during the hydrological year 2016â2017 on a monthly basis. Moreover, the use of groundwater and surface water equivalent freshwater heads, along with hydraulic conductivity tests and the geological architecture, permitted to connect the salinity variations in the wetlands with the degree of the hydraulic connection between the wetlands, the Volturno River, the Tyrrenian Sea and the coastal aquifer. The results show that the permanent wetlands fed by both the Volturno River and the Tyrrenian Sea, show a smoothed salinity peak during the summer season; while the ephemeral wetlands hydraulically disconnected from the aquifer show high salinity peaks during the summer season due to evapoconcentration processes. Spatial mapping of salinity and other measured parameters, highlighted an elevated heterogeneity of environments (from saline to freshwater environments) enclosed in the Variconi oasis. This in turn, induced a large biodiversity of both autochthonous and migratory species. Despite of this, the projected increase in salinity of these wetlands due to coastal erosion, augmented evapotranspiration rates and sea level rise, could be of serious concern for the above-mentioned biodiversity, thus monitoring and management strategies are urgently required to preserve this and other oasis in the Mediterranean area that are key sites employed as stop-over along migratory routes.

Circulating risks: Coastal cities and the spectre of climate change risk,"Gotham, K.F.; Cannon, C.","Climate change is an urgent problem for coastal regions already facing the challenges of urbanization, overcrowding, subsidence and nutrient loading. Global mean temperatures are on the rise, ice sheets and glaciers are rapidly melting, and sea levels are rising (Nicholls et al. 2007; for an overview, see Moser et al. 2012). Scientists expect sea-level rise to exacerbate existing risks such as coastal flooding, coastal land loss, rising water tables and drainage problems, and salinization of coastal environments (Blum and Roberts 2009; Gonzalez and Tornqvist 2006; IPCC 2014; Karl 2009; National Academy of Sciences 2003: 4; Stern 2007; USGCRP 2013). Apart from climate change, predicted land loss combined with increasing population growth in coastal areas could endanger regional economies, threaten sources of fresh water, and alter land cover patterns and ecosystem services (e.g. provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; and cultural services such as spiritual, recreational and cultural benefits) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). âThe scope, severity, and pace of future climate change impacts are difficult to predictâ, according to the White House Council on Environmental Quality (2010: 6), but âcoastal areas will need to prepare for rising sea levels and increased flooding.â Adding to the challenge of responding to these impacts, climate-related changes will likely exacerbate the impacts of other non-climatic risks and stressors such as pervasive inequality, jurisdictional fragmentation, fiscal strains, ageing infrastructure, habitat destruction and pollution (IPCC 2014).

Floodplain Inundation and Salinization From a Recently Restored First-Order Tidal Stream,"Yabusaki, S.B.; Myers-Pigg, A.N.; Ward, N.D.; Waichler, S.R.; Sengupta, A.; Hou, Z.; Chen, X.; Fang, Y.; Duan, Z.; Serkowski, J.A.; Indivero, J.; Wiese Moore, C.; Gunn, C.M.","The systematic response of coastal ecosystems to inundation and salinity exposure is fundamental to their ecology and biogeochemical function. Here we observe and model freshwater-seawater interactions in a first-order streamâfloodplain system where tidal access was recently restored. Subsurface flow and transport modeling were used to quantify and better understand the interplay of processes, properties, and conditions that control water level and salinity in the floodplain to the tidal stream. Water levels in the stream were highly correlated with tidal forcing, which resulted in episodic inundation of the floodplain at quasi-monthly frequency. The tidal stream is the only source of salinity to the floodplain, yet shallow groundwater salinity was considerably higher than average stream salinity. The low-permeability clay floodplain soils limit lateral groundwater flow and transport, resulting in floodplain groundwater and salinity dynamics driven almost exclusively by infiltration during inundation events. As inundation occurs during high tide, estuarine waters reach the floodplain with minor attenuation in salinity from the stream's freshwater discharge. Infiltration and salinity exposure are topography controlled and regulated by ponding depth and duration, seasonal ground saturation, and depth to water table. The model suggests that floodplain salinity is currently in an early stage of transition from pre-restoration freshwater conditions and will not reach equilibrium for ~20Â years. These findings have broad relevance for understanding how and over what time scales coastal ecosystems will respond to increasing seawater exposure from sea level rise, ocean-originating storms, and changes in natural and man-made barriers.

Marsh bird occupancy along the shoreline-to-forest gradient as marshes migrate from rising sea level,"Taillie, P.J.; Moorman, C.E.","One mechanism by which coastal marshes may persist as sea-level rises is to expand landward into existing forest, a process known as marsh migration. Though recent studies highlight the importance of marsh migration to the conservation of birds associated with coastal marshes, marsh bird responses to this transition from forest to marsh are poorly understood. To address this need, we conducted surveys of five focal marsh bird taxa at 92 points distributed across the gradient from the shoreline to the marshâforest interface in one of the most vulnerable regions to sea-level rise in North America where marshes have been migrating landward for at least several decades. Given this landward movement of the forestâmarsh interface, we modeled focal taxa occurrence as a function of distance-to-forest, thereby assuming that marshes closer to the forest were newer than those closer to the shoreline. In addition, we investigated the effects of vegetation conditions and fire frequency. Occupancy probability of marsh birds decreased closer to the forestâmarsh interface where woody vegetation was taller and herbaceous cover was dominated by Cladium jamaicense, suggesting migrated marsh may provide limited habitat for these bird species, at least in the short term. Though parameter estimate uncertainty for black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) was high due to a limited number of detections, occupancy of this species may increase with the conditions associated with migrated marsh, specifically greater C.Â jamaicense dominance and decreasing distance-to-forest. Clapper/king rail (Rallus crepitans/elegans) occupancy was greater at sites that had burned more frequently over the past decade, and occupancy of all focal taxa was greater in areas with vegetation conditions consistent with the effects of fire in coastal marshes, including reduced herbaceous vegetation density and shorter woody vegetation. As such, prescribed fire may serve as an effective method of facilitating marsh migration and increasing the quality and quantity of habitat for coastal marsh birds as sea-level rises.

MANTRA-O18: An Extended Version of SUTRA Modified to Simulate Salt and Î´18O Transport amid Water Uptake by Plants,"Teh, S.Y.; De Angelis, D.L.; Voss, C.I.; Sternberg, L.; Koh, H.L.","Sea level rise and the increasing landward intrusion of storm surges pose the threat of replacement of salinity-intolerant vegetation of important coastal habitats by salinity-tolerant vegetation. Therefore, a means is needed to better understand the processes that influence this vegetation shift and to aid in the management of coastal resources. For this purpose, a hydrology-salinity-vegetation model known as MANTRA was developed by coupling a spatially explicit model (MANHAM) for simulation of vegetation community dynamics along coastal salinity gradients with SUTRA, a USGS groundwater flow and transport model. MANTRA has been used to project possible future changes in Coot Bay Hammock in southern Florida under conditions of gradually rising sea level and storm surges. The simulation study concluded that feasibility exists of a regime shift from hardwood hammocks to mangroves subject to a few conditions, namely severe damage to the existing hammock after a storm surge and a sufficiently persistent high salinity condition and high input of mangrove seedlings. Early detection of salinity stress in vegetation may facilitate sustainable conservation measures being applied. It has been shown that the Î´18O value of water in the xylem of trees can be used as a surrogate for salinity in the rooting zone of plants, which is difficult to measure directly. Hence, the model MANTRA is revised into MANTRA-O18 by including the Î´18O of the tree xylem dynamics. A simulation study by MANTRA-O18 shows that effects of increasing salinization can be detected many years before the salinity-intolerant trees are threatened with replacement.

Regulated and unregulated halogenated disinfection byproduct formation from chlorination of saline groundwater,"Szczuka, A.; Parker, K.M.; Harvey, C.; Hayes, E.; Vengosh, A.; Mitch, W.A.","Coastal utilities exploiting mildly saline groundwater (<150 mg/L chloride) may be challenged by disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, a concern likely to increase with sea-level rise. Groundwater from North Carolina coastal aquifers is characterized by large variations in concentrations of halides (bromide up to 10,600 Î¼g/L) and dissolved organic carbon (up to 5.7 mg-C/L). Formation of 33 regulated and unregulated halogenated DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles, haloacetamides, and haloacetaldehydes, was measured after simulated chlorination of 24 coastal North Carolina groundwater samples under typical chlorination conditions. Results of chlorination simulation show that THM levels exceeded the Primary Maximum Contaminant Levels in half of the chlorinated samples. Addition of halides to a low salinity groundwater (110 mg/L chloride) indicated that elevated bromide triggered DBP formation, but chloride was not a critical factor for their formation. DBP speciation, but not overall molar formation, was strongly correlated with bromide variations in the groundwater. THMs and HAAs dominated the measured halogenated DBPs on a mass concentration basis. When measured concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency, haloacetonitriles, and to a lesser degree, haloacetaldehydes and HAAs, were the predominant contributors to calculated DBP-associated toxicity. For some samples exhibiting elevated ammonia concentrations, the addition of chlorine to form chloramines in situ significantly reduced halogenated DBP concentrations and calculated toxicity. HAAs dominated the calculated toxicity of chloraminated waters. Reverse osmosis treatment of saline groundwater (chloride >250 mg/L) can reduce DBP formation by removing halides and organic precursors. However, we show that in a case where reverse osmosis permeate is blended with a separate raw groundwater, the residual bromide level in the permeate could still exceed that in the raw groundwater, and thereby induce DBP formation in the blend. DBP-associated calculated toxicity increased for certain blends in this system due to the DBPs resulting from the combination of the elevated bromide concentration in the permeate and the organic precursors from the raw coastal groundwater.

"Ice Sheets, Glaciers, and Sea Level","Allison, I.; Colgan, W.; King, M.; Paul, F.","Within the past 125,000. years, variations in Earth's climate have resulted in global sea levels fluctuating from 130 to 140. m lower than present day to 6 to 9. m higher. Presently, global mean sea level is rising at its fastest rate in the past 6,000. years (~3. mm/year). In this chapter, we discuss both the causes and implications of sea-level rise from the perspective of a cryospheric hazard. We also survey the best estimates of sea-level rise and cryospheric mass change from a variety of monitoring techniques. The transfer of terrestrial ice into the sea has contributed about 50 percent of the sea-level rise since 1993, and probably exceeded the combined sea-level changes due to thermal expansion, changes in terrestrial water storage, and changes in ocean basin size since 2003. This cryospheric contribution to sea-level rise is approximately equally split between the combined ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, and the global population of about 200,000 glaciers. The societal effects of sea-level rise will be highly varied throughout the world, with some locations experiencing relatve sea-level drop, whereas others experience a relative sea-level rise several times the global mean. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the sea-level rise due to terrestrial ice loss will be most substantial in areas furthest from the source of melting ice. Although this cryospheric hazard will unfold over a much longer time scale than many of the other hazards discussed in this volume, the ramifications of sea-level rise will likely be more widespread and profound. Some implications discussed here include coastal inundation, increased coastal flood frequency and groundwater salinization. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2015,,"Snow and Ice-Relat.

Impact of topography on groundwater salinization due to ocean surge inundation,"Yu, X.; Yang, J.; Graf, T.; Koneshloo, M.; O'Neal, M.A.; Michael, H.A.","Sea-level rise and increases in the frequency and intensity of ocean surges caused by climate change are likely to exacerbate adverse effects on low-lying coastal areas. The landward flow of water during ocean surges introduces salt to surficial coastal aquifers and threatens groundwater resources. Coastal topographic features (e.g., ponds, dunes, barrier islands, and channels) likely have a strong impact on overwash and salinization processes, but are generally highly simplified in modeling studies. To understand topographic impacts on groundwater salinization, we modeled a theoretical overwash event and variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in 3-D using the fully coupled surface and subsurface numerical simulator, HydroGeoSphere. The model simulates the coastal aquifer as an integrated system considering overland flow, coupled surface and subsurface exchange, variably saturated flow, and variable-density groundwater flow. To represent various coastal landscape types, we simulated both synthetic fields and real-world coastal topography from Delaware, USA. The groundwater salinization assessment suggested that the topographic connectivity promoting overland flow controls the volume of aquifer that is salinized. In contrast, the amount of water that can be stored in surface depressions determines the amount of seawater that infiltrates the subsurface and the time for seawater to flush from the aquifer. Our study suggests that topography has a significant impact on groundwater salinization due to ocean surge overwash, with important implications for coastal land management and groundwater vulnerability assessment.

Planning for the impacts of sea level rise,"Nicholls, R.J.","Coastal areas constitute important habitats, and they contain a large and growing population, much of it located in economic centers such as London, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Lagos. The range of coastal hazards includes climate-induced sea level rise, a long-term threat that demands broad response. Global sea levels rose 17 cm through the twentieth century, and are likely to rise more rapidly through the twenty-first century when a rise of more than 1 m is possible. In some locations, these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this scenario is less certain, and (2) widespread human induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from, and drainage of, susceptible soils, especially in deltas. Relative sea level rise has a range of potential impacts, including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, salinization of surface and ground waters, and degradation of coastal habitats such as wetlands. Without adaptation, large land areas and millions of people could be displaced by sea level rise. Appropriate responses include climate mitigation (a global response) and/or adaptation (a local response). A combination of these strategies appears to be the most appropriate approach to sea level rise regardless of the uncertainty. Adaptation responses can be characterized as (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat. While these adaptation responses could reduce impacts significantly, they will need to be consistent with responses to all coastal hazards, as well as with wider societal and development objectives; hence, an integrated coastal management philosophy is required. In some developed countries, including England and the Netherlands, proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated. Coastal cities worldwide will be a major focus for adaptation efforts because of their concentrations of people and assets. Developing countries will pose adaptation challenges, especially in deltaic areas and small islands, which are the most vulnerable settings. Â© 2011 by The Oceanography Society.

Cultural dynamics of adaptation to climate change: An example from the east coast of the US,"Martinez, G.; Paolisso, M.J.","This contribution explores the role of culture in relation to local knowledge and values as displayed in the interpretations and actions of distinct groups of residents, concerning adapting to climate change in Dorchester County. Situated in the Mid-Atlantic area on the East Coast of the US, Dorchester County is at risk due to projected high sea level rise, flooding, salinisation and increased erosion. The research is based on a theoretical position that interpretation of risks and responses by distinct groups are shaped by frames or systems of cultural knowledge and values. For our study region, we were interested in which ways local knowledge and values of major cultural groups (e.g. watermen, farmers, winemakers, trappers), shape their understanding and perceptions of climate change risks, and in turn the consequences of that cultural knowledge in terms of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience. Our research also includes perspectives of under-represented, poor African Americans for whom threats posed by natural hazards and anthropogenic changes are disproportionately proximate. Furthermore, we incorporate perspectives of employees from the local zoning and planning department, views that allow us to better understand the policy contexts of our study groups' different cultural perspectives. Methodologically speaking, our findings are based on ethnographic methods (including qualitative interviews with key cultural groups in Dorchester County, and a quantitative survey from a workshop with coastal authorities from several Chesapeake Bay counties) as well as document analysis. In particular, we focus on images of nature, sense of place and change, risk perception and barriers. In addition, we also consider socio-economic factors such as economic development and public and private (coastal) property issues. We found that the beliefs and values of a distinct group of people in a given region shape their perceptions of climate change and hence their responses to changes in the environment and their communities.

"Seawater intrusion processes, investigation and management: Recent advances and future challenges","Werner, A.D.; Bakker, M.; Post, V.E.A.; Vandenbohede, A.; Lu, C.; Ataie-Ashtiani, B.; Simmons, C.T.; Barry, D.A.","Seawater intrusion (SI) is a global issue, exacerbated by increasing demands for freshwater in coastal zones and predisposed to the influences of rising sea levels and changing climates. This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50. years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater-saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings. Multidisciplinary research is warranted to evaluate interactions between SI and submarine groundwater discharge, ecosystem health and unsaturated zone processes. Recent advances in numerical simulation, calibration and optimization techniques require rigorous field-scale application to contemporary issues of climate change, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic and ecological factors that are inseparable elements of SI management. The number of well-characterized examples of SI is small, and this has impeded understanding of field-scale processes, such as those controlling mixing zones, saltwater upconing, heterogeneity effects and other factors. Current SI process understanding is based mainly on numerical simulation and laboratory sand-tank experimentation to unravel the combined effects of tides, surface water-groundwater interaction, heterogeneity, pumping and density contrasts. The research effort would benefit from intensive measurement campaigns to delineate accurately interfaces and their movement in response to real-world coastal aquifer stresses, encompassing a range of geological and hydrological settings.

Factors Affecting Occupancy and Abundance of American Alligators at the Northern Extent of Their Range,"Gardner, B.; Garner, L.A.; Cobb, D.T.; Moorman, C.E.","Populations of American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) generally are considered more abundant at present than historically; however, little information exists to assess the population of alligators in North Carolina at the northern extent of the species' range. Investigation of the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of alligators in North Carolina could shed light on the species' response to rapid environmental change in the region. We conducted a two-phase study: 1) to assess the distribution of alligators in North Carolina using a site-occupancy design; and 2) to assess the patterns in abundance using a repeated sampling design for population estimation. Results showed that both occupancy and abundance decreased in more northern sites, in sites with higher salinity, and in sites that were generally more westward. Sites sampled later in June were more likely to be occupied than those sampled earlier in the month. Abundance also increased with greater shoreline vegetation complexity and varied between lakes, rivers, and estuaries. Compared with studies from 30 years prior, the population seems fairly stable in terms of abundance and distribution. Given the northern limits of the species and the negative association with salinity, continued monitoring is warranted to understand changes in distribution and abundance with respect to predicted rates of sea-level rise, salinization, and urbanization locally around coastal cities like Wilmington.

Influence of salinity and prey presence on the survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates of a freshwater marsh,"Kang, S.-R.; King, S.L.","Salinization of coastal freshwater environments is a global issue. Increased salinity from sea level rise, storm surges, or other mechanisms is common in coastal freshwater marshes of Louisiana, USA. The effects of salinity increases on aquatic macroinvertebrates in these systems have received little attention, despite the importance of aquatic macroinvertebrates for nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and as a food source for vertebrate species. We used microcosm experiments to evaluate the effects of salinity, duration of exposure, and prey availability on the relative survival of dominant aquatic macroinvertebrates (i. e., Procambarus clarkii Girard, Cambarellus puer Hobbs, Libellulidae, Dytiscidae cybister) in a freshwater marsh of southwestern Louisiana. We hypothesized that increased salinity, absence of prey, and increased duration of exposure would decrease survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates and that crustaceans would have higher survival than aquatic insect taxon. Our first hypothesis was only partially supported as only salinity increases combined with prolonged exposure duration affected aquatic macroinvertebrate survival. Furthermore, crustaceans had higher survival than aquatic insects. Salinity stress may cause mortality when acting together with other stressful conditions.

Periodicity in Stem Growth and Litterfall in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands: Influence of Salinity and Drought on Nitrogen Recycling,"Cormier, N.; Krauss, K.W.; Conner, W.H.","Many tidally influenced freshwater forested wetlands (tidal swamps) along the south Atlantic coast of the USA are currently undergoing dieback and decline. Salinity often drives conversion of tidal swamps to marsh, especially under conditions of regional drought. During this change, alterations in nitrogen (N) uptake from dominant vegetation or timing of N recycling from the canopy during annual litter senescence may help to facilitate marsh encroachment by providing for greater bioavailable N with small increases in salinity. To monitor these changes along with shifts in stand productivity, we established sites along two tidal swamp landscape transects on the lower reaches of the Waccamaw River (South Carolina) and Savannah River (Georgia) representing freshwater (â¤0.1 psu), low oligohaline (1.1-1.6 psu), and high oligohaline (2.6-4.1 psu) stands; the latter stands have active marsh encroachment. Aboveground tree productivity was monitored on all sites through monthly litterfall collection and dendrometer band measurements from 2005 to 2009. Litterfall samples were pooled by season and analyzed for total N and carbon (C). On average between the two rivers, freshwater, low oligohaline, and high oligohaline tidal swamps returned 8,126, 3,831, and 1,471 mg N m-2 year-1, respectively, to the forest floor through litterfall, with differences related to total litterfall volume rather than foliar N concentrations. High oligohaline sites were most inconsistent in patterns of foliar N concentrations and N loading from the canopy. Leaf N content generally decreased and foliar C/N generally increased with salinization (excepting one site), with all sites being fairly inefficient in resorbing N from leaves prior to senescence. Stands with higher salinity also had greater flood frequency and duration, lower basal area increments, lower tree densities, higher numbers of dead or dying trees, and much reduced leaf litter fall (103 vs. 624 g m-2 year-1) over the five study years. Our data suggest that alternative processes, such as the rate of decomposition and potential for N mineralization, on tidal swamp sites undergoing salinity-induced state change may be more important for controlling N biogeochemical cycling in soils than differences among sites in N loading via litterfall.

Seawater Intrusion Under Current Sea-Level Rise: Processes Accompanying Coastline Transgression,"Laattoe, T.; Werner, A.D.; Simmons, C.T.","The freshwater resources of coastal aquifers are vulnerable to seawater intrusion (SWI) caused by the current rising trends in sea levels, amongst other factors. Recent studies have examined the extents, rates and timescales associated with SWI induced by expected levels of sea-level rise (SLR), but have neglected the effects of transgression (i.e. inland migration of the shoreline in response to SLR). In this chapter, variable-density numerical modelling is used to examine the implications of transgression for a range of SWI scenarios based on simplified coastal aquifer settings. Vertical intrusion during transgressions can involve density-driven convective processes, causing substantially larger amounts of seawater to enter the aquifer and creating more extensive intrusion than that of horizontal SWI occurring in the absence of transgression. Interestingly, cases of transgression where no vertical mixing occurs involve reduced landward migration of the wedge toe, relative to otherwise similar situations without transgression. The rates and extents of SWI caused by transgression and associated vertical mixing appear to be almost non-responsive to the choice of landward boundary condition, contradictory to the findings of SLR-SWI studies that neglect transgression. The findings of this study suggest that modelling analyses that neglect the effects of transgression in SLR-SWI investigations may underestimate significantly the rates and extent of SWI.

Deltas at risk,"Syvitski, J.P.M.","The long-term sustainability of populated deltas is often more affected by large-scale engineering projects than sea-level rise associated with global warming and the global ocean volume increase. On deltas, the rate of relative eustatic sea-level rise is often smaller than the rate for isostatic-controlled subsidence and of the same order of magnitude as natural sediment compaction. Accelerated compaction associated with petroleum and groundwater mining can exceed natural subsidence rates by an order of magnitude. The reduction in sediment delivery to deltas due to trapping behind dams, along with the human control of routing river discharge across delta plains, contributes to the sinking of world deltas. Consequences include shoreline erosion, threatened mangroves swamps and wetlands, increased salinization of cultivated land, and hundreds of millions of humans put at risk.

The Global Impacts of Extreme Sea-Level Rise: A Comprehensive Economic Assessment,"Pycroft, J.; Abrell, J.; Ciscar, J.-C.","This paper investigates the world-wide economic cost of rapid sea-level rise of the kind that could be caused by accelerated ice flow from the West Antarctic and/or the Greenland ice sheets. Such an event would have direct impacts on economic activities located near the coastline and indirect impacts further inland. Using data from the DIVA model on sea floods, river floods, land loss, salinisation and forced migration, we analyse the effects of these damages in a computable general equilibrium model for 25 world regions. We consider three sea-level rise scenarios that correspond to 0.47, 1.12 and 1.75Â m by the 2080s. By incorporating a wider range of damage categories, implemented in an economy-wide framework and including very rapid sea-level rise, the study offers a new contribution to climate change impact studies. We find that the loss of GDP worldwide is 0.5Â % in the highest sea-level rise scenario, with a loss of welfare (equivalent variation) of almost 2Â % world-wide. Within these aggregates, there are large regional disparities, with the Central Europe North region and parts of South-East Asia and South Asia being especially prone to high costs (welfare losses in the range of 4â12Â %). The analysis assumes that there is not public adaptation, which would substantially lower the costs. In this way, the analysis demonstrates what is at risk, and could be used to justify adaptation expenses. Â© 2015, The Author(s).",2016,,Environ. Resour.

"Hydrologic exchanges and baldcypress water use on deltaic hummocks, Louisiana, USA","Hsueh, Y.-H.; Chambers, J.L.; Krauss, K.W.; Allen, S.T.; Keim, R.F.","Coastal forested hummocks support clusters of trees in the saltwaterâfreshwater transition zone. To examine how hummocks support trees in mesohaline sites that are beyond physiological limits of the trees, we used salinity and stable isotopes (2H and 18O) of water as tracers to understand water fluxes in hummocks and uptake by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.), which is the most abundant tree species in coastal freshwater forests of the southeastern U.S. Hummocks were always partially submerged and were completely submerged 1 to 8% of the time during the two studied growing seasons, in association with high water in the estuary. Salinity, Î´18O, and Î´2H varied more in the shallow open water than in groundwater. Surface water and shallow groundwater were similar to throughfall in isotopic composition, which suggested dominance by rainfall. Salinity of groundwater in hummocks increased with depth, was higher than in swales, and fluctuated little over time. Isotopic composition of xylem water in baldcypress was similar to the vadose zone and unlike other measured sources, indicating that trees preferentially use unsaturated hummock tops as refugia from higher salinity and saturated soil in swales and the lower portions of hummocks. Sustained upward gradients of salinity from groundwater to surface water and vadose water, and low variation in groundwater salinity and isotopic composition, suggested long residence time, limited exchange with surface water, and that the shallow subsurface of hummocks is characterized by episodic salinization and slow dilution.

Sapflow and water use of freshwater wetland trees exposed to saltwater incursion in a tidally influenced South Carolina watershed,"Krauss, K.W.; Duberstein, J.A.","Sea-level rise and anthropogenic activity promote salinity incursion into many tidal freshwater forested wetlands. Interestingly, individual trees can persist for decades after salt impact. To understand why, we documented sapflow (Js), reduction in Js with sapwood depth, and water use (F) of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) trees undergoing exposure to salinity. The mean Js of individual trees was reduced by 2.8 g H2OÂ·m-2Â·s-1 (or by 18%) in the outer sapwood on a saline site versus a freshwater site; however, the smallest trees, present only on the saline site, also registered the lowest Js. Hence, tree size significantly influenced the overall site effect on Js. Trees undergoing perennial exposure to salt used greater relative amounts of water in outer sapwood than in inner sapwood depths, which identifies a potentially different strategy for baldcypress trees coping with saline site conditions over decades. Overall, individual trees used 100 kg H2OÂ·day-1 on a site that remained relatively fresh versus 23.9 kg H2OÂ·day-1 on the saline site. We surmise that perennial salinization of coastal freshwater forests forces shifts in individual-tree osmotic balance and water-use strategy to extend survival time on suboptimal sites, which further influences growth and morphology.",2010,,Can.

Global assessment of vulnerability to sea-level rise in topography-limited and recharge-limited coastal groundwater systems,"Michael, H.A.; Russoniello, C.J.; Byron, L.A.","Impacts of rising sea level on the hydraulic balance between aquifers and the ocean threaten fresh water resources and aquatic ecosystems along many world coastlines. Understanding the vulnerability of groundwater systems to these changes and the primary factors that determine the magnitude of system response is critical to developing effective management and adaptation plans in coastal zones. We assessed the vulnerability of two types of groundwater systems, recharge-limited and topography-limited, to changes caused by sea-level rise over a range of hydrogeologic settings. Vulnerability in this context is defined by the rate and magnitude of salinization of coastal aquifers and changes in groundwater flow to the sea. Two-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport simulations indicate that the response of recharge-limited systems is largely minimal, whereas topography-limited systems are vulnerable for various combinations of permeability, vertical anisotropy in permeability, and recharge. World coastlines were classified according to system type as a vulnerability indicator. Results indicate that approximately 70% of world coastlines may be topography-limited, though variability in hydrogeologic conditions strongly affects classification. Future recharge and sea-level rise scenarios have much less influence on the proportion of vulnerable coastlines than differences in permeability, distance to a hydraulic divide, and recharge, indicating that hydrogeologic properties and setting are more important factors to consider in determining system type than uncertainties in the magnitude of sea-level rise and hydrologic shifts associated with future climate change.

Modes of seawater intrusion during transgressions,"Kooi, H.; Groen, J.; Leijnse, A.","Analytical methods and numerical experiments are used to study salinization of groundwater in response to sea level rise. The system that is studied involves a saturated porous medium with an inclined upper surface. The upper surface is progressively inundated during sea level rise to simulate transgression, the landward migration of the shoreline. Four ""modes"" of seawater intrusion are distinguished: (1) horizontal intrusion for slow transgression and a relatively high-permeability (sand/silt) substrate, (2) vertical intrusion by seawater fingering for fast transgression and a sand/silt substrate, (3) vertical intrusion by diffusion for fast transgression and a low-permeability (clay) substrate, (4) vertical intrusion by combined diffusion and low-salinity fingering for fast transgression and a clay layer at the seafloor overlying an aquifer. These four modes are characterized by the development of very distinctive transition zones between the fresh and salt groundwater domains. An analytical expression is derived for the critical transgression rate which separates horizontal (mode 1) from dominantly vertical (modes 2-4) intrusion. For modes 3 and 4, salinization significantly lags behind sea level rise. The results are consistent with observations of fossil fresh/brackish groundwater beneath many continental shelves and shallow seas.",2000,,Water Resour.

Nutrient processing and the development of tidal creek ecosystems,"Dame, R.F.; Gardner, L.R.","The North Inlet marsh-estuarine system encompasses the spectrum of interaction between the ocean and the uplands typical of the southeastern United States. The system is an ebb-dominated, bar-built estuary with good flow connection to the sea and some freshwater input. The North Inlet basin has evolved from a forested, relic, beach-ridge terrain under a regime of slowly rising sea level (2 mm year-1). This mode of development is supported by historic tide gage data. 210Pb dating of sediment cores, the presence of spodic soil horizons and tree roots at shallow depths beneath the marsh surface, and the presence of relic 'cat eye' ponds at the edge of the salt marsh. As sea level rises, the boundary between forest and salt marsh recedes upslope and forest spodosols are gradually transformed into marsh soils by salinization, the deposition and mixing of marine mud into the upper horizons of the forest soil and the accumulation of reduced sulfur via sulfate reduction. As a forest watershed is transformed into a salt-marsh basin, the hydraulic geometry of the original, black-water (fresh) stream increases to accommodate the increasing volumes of tidal discharge. Forest sands move seaward while marine muds are transported into the basin. As water moves between the forest and the sea, it passes through creeks in different developmental stages. Large mature creeks interact with the ocean while young, ephemeral creeks drain the uplands and intertidal marsh zones. Intermediate stage creeks connect these two and are characterized by the presence of oyster reefs. Net nutrient fluxes appear to be different in each developmental stage. The 'Bly Creek' study of Dame and coworkers addressed the flux of materials between a creek at the intermediate stage of development and the adjacent mature system. Material fluxes from a freshwater stream draining into Bly Creek from the adjacent uplands were also observed. The role of the salt marsh and the oyster reefs in determining material fluxes was examined. The Bly Creek basin imports particulate nutrients and exports dissolved forms. The 'Outwelling' study of Dame and coworkers at North Inlet focused on the flux of materials between the mature creeks and the Atlantic Ocean. All constituents were exported seasonally and annually from the estuary, except total sediments (imported during fall and winter) and chlorophyll a (imported in the summer and fall). The export of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was high compared with other estuarine systems. On a unit area basis, primary productivity is higher and nutrient fluxes are lower in Bly Creek (intermediate stage of development) as compared with the mature North Inlet system. These observations support the general ecosystem development hypothesis that nutrient storage and retention are higher in younger systems than more mature systems where growth is lower and fewer nutrients are needed.

Global coastal hazards from future sea level rise,"Gornitz, V.","A rise of sea level between 0.3 and 0.9 m by the end of the next century, caused by predicted greenhouse climate warming, would endanger human populations, cities, ports, and wetlands in low-lying coastal areas, through inundation, erosion and salinization. The consequences of a global sea level rise would be spatially non-uniform because of local or regional vertical crustal movements, differential resistance to erosion, varying wave climates, and changeable longshore currents. Although many factors can influence sea level, leading to a noisy record, various studies utilizing tide-gauge data find an average global rate of sea level rise of 1-2 mm/yr, over the last 100 years. This trend is part of a general rise over the last 300 years, since the low point of the Little Ice Age. Sea level rise may accelerate 3-8 times over present rates, within the next century. The permanently inundated coastal zone would extend to a depth equivalent to the vertical rise in sea level. Major river deltas, coastal wetlands and coral islands would be most affected. Episodic flooding by storm waves and surges would penetrate even farther inland. Beach and cliff erosion will be accentuated. Saltwater penetration into coastal aquifers and estuaries could contaminate urban water supplies and affect agricultural production. Research on relative risks and impacts of sea level rise on specific localities is still at an early stage. Development of a global coastal hazards data base, intended to provide an overview of the relative vulnerabilities of the world's coastlines, is described in this paper. To date, information on seven variables, associated with inundation and erosion hazards, has been compiled for the U.S., and parts of Canada and Mexico. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) has been designed to flag high risk coastal segments. Preliminary results are presented for the eastern United States, as a test case.

Modeling the impact of tidal inundation on submerging coastal landscapes of the Chesapeake Bay,"Hussein, A.H.; Rabenhorst, M.C.","Chronofunctions describing changes in electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) were derived for upland and submerged pedons along two coastal soil transects in Dorchester County, Maryland: The weighted mean EC and ESP were regressed against time in order to derive models that describe changes in salinization and alkalinization. This was best approximated using exponential and linear models. During the early and intermediate stages of pedogenesis, the exponential model estimated the average rate of salinization for the whole profile to increase from 0.02 to 0.06 dS m-1 yr-1, while the average rate of alkalinization increased from 0.02 to 0.05% yr-1. The linear model estimated the average rate of salinization to be 0.04 dS m-1 yr-1, while it estimated the average rate of alkalinization to be 0.03% yr-1. Because only data from early and intermediate stages of the idealized chronofunctions of salinization and alkalinization were available, the use of the models to predict late-stage impact on EC and ESP is limited. To address the limitation, the measured data were joined with theoretical limits to derive sigmoidal chronofunctions.

Tidal inundation of transgressive coastal areas: Pedogenesis of salinization and alkalinization,"Hussein, A.H.; Rabenhorst, M.C.","Two transects were selected across submerging landscapes in Dorchester County, Maryland, to study the impact of the frequency of tidal inundation on salinization and alkalinization. The frequency of high tides of a particular elevation increases over time due to rising sea level to create dynamic environments in submerging coastal soils. The constructed frequency distribution curves of high tide at Hell Hook and Cedar Creek revealed that the frequency pattern was logarithmic and increased with lower elevation. This distribution enhances the relative importance of tidally induced pedogenic processes at elevations approaching mean high water. For pedons above mean high water, the effect of salinization and alkalinization processes follows the logarithmic frequency distribution pattern. However, for pedons below mean high water, the effect of these pedogenic processes is expected to decline toward a steady-state condition. In marsh environments, the pH-dependent acidity of submerging Al-buffered soils (Ultisols) is not replaced upon permanent inundation, and increasing electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil solution enhances the selectivity of the colloidal complex for Al. Therefore, in response to sea-level rise, low-lying Ultisols transform directly to Histosols. Due to high exchangeable acidity associated with Atlantic coastal soils, the assumptions underlying the relationship between the exchangeable sodium percentage and the sodium adsorption ratio are not valid. Thus, exchangeable sodium percentage should be used to assess soil alkalinity.",2001,,Soil Sci. Soc. Am.

"Soil evolution along a forest-salt marsh transect under a regime of slowly rising sea level, southeastern United States","Gardner, L.R.; Smith, B.R.; Michener, W.K.","Soil evolution in salt marshes at North Inlet, SC, is driven by slowly rising sea level (3.4 mm/yr). As sea level rises the boundary between the low-lying coastal forest and high marsh moves up slope. As sandy forested Spodosols become subject to tidal inundation and salinization, forest vegetation (Pinus, Quercus, Nyssa, Lagerstroemia, and Vaccinium) is replaced successively by Cedrus, Iva, Juncus, Borrichia, Salicornia, short-form Spartina, and finally medium Spartina. These botanical changes accompany gradual changes in soil texture, chemistry and morphology. The originally sandy textured A and E horizons of the Spodosol become progressively enriched in clay and silt by tidal deposition of marine mud. These fine grained deposits do not form a distinct geogenetic layer but rather are mixed downward into the original sandy horizons by intense fiddler crab (Uca) burrowing. Thus soils in the marsh become gradually more sandy with depth. The strong color contrast between the original A and E horizons is eventually obliterated by mud enrichment and the growth of a dense Spartina root mat, leaving a medium gray A horizon that is difficult to sub-divide. In addition, the decay of organic matter in the marsh soils via sulfate reduction results in increased soil sulfur with distance into the marsh. The sandy, black spodic horizon originally formed in the forest environment occurs beneath the marsh surface at depths of less than 1 m and to distances of several hundred meters from the forestmarsh boundary. Except perhaps for its upper 10 cm, the spodic B horizon appears to have been little affected by marsh processes. The presence of the spodic horizon in the marsh profile, and the fact that it is not buried beneath a sufficiently thick and distinct geologic deposit, poses an interesting taxonomic problem. Based on their moisture regime, sulfur content, and spodic horizons, the marsh soils are best classified as Sulfaquentic Haplaquods. However, the spodic horizon, which is diagnostic for this classification, is clearly relict in terms of the processes that are thought to be responsible for its formation.

Saltwater intrusion induces shifts in soil microbial diversity and carbon use efficiency in a coastal grassland ecosystem,"Brown, R.W.; Rhymes, J.M.; Jones, D.L.","Salt accumulation and salinisation of coastal soils is a global issue. Further, climate change is likely to increase the amount of land affected by salinity due to the increasing frequency and severity of coastal flooding and brackish water ingress. The impact of this on the ability of soils to deliver ecosystem services, particularly carbon (C) storage, however, remains unclear. We hypothesized that coastal inundation would negatively affect C storage by lowering plant C inputs and by placing greater osmotic stress on the microbial community leading to a reduced C use efficiency (CUE). Here, we use a coastal grassland ecosystem, which is becoming increasingly subjected to sea and brackish water flooding, to explore the relationship between plant/microbial growth and CUE along a natural salinity gradient. To reflect steady state conditions, we traced the turnover and partitioning of a low (ambient) dose and high (growth stimulation) dose of 14C-labelled glucose into microbial anabolic and catabolic pools, from which microbial CUE was calculated. This was supported by measurements of the diversity of the bacterial community across the salinity gradient using 16S metabarcoding. Our results showed that coastal flooding significantly reduced plant growth (p < 0.005), increased soil C content (p < 0.05) and induced an increase in microbial CUE under low glucose-C conditions (p < 0.05). Conversely, no significant difference in CUE or microbial growth was apparent when a high glucose-C dose was used. Soil bacterial community alpha (Î±) diversity increased with soil salinity while beta (Î²) diversity also shifted in response to the higher saline conditions. Our analysis suggests that the largest impact of coastal flooding on soil C cycling was the inability of the plant community to adapt, leading to higher plant residue inputs as well as the decline in soil structure. Conversely, the microbial community had adapted to the increased salinity, resulting in only small changes in the uptake and metabolic partitioning of C. Â© 2022 The Authors",2022,,Soil Biol.

"Storm Surges Cause Simultaneous Salinization and Freshening of Coastal Aquifers, Exacerbated by Climate Change","Paldor, A.; Michael, H.A.","Ocean surge events are known to threaten coastal aquifers through vertical infiltration, with the degree of salinization depending on hydrogeologic factors. Another salinization process in coastal aquifers is lateral saltwater intrusion, which may also be affected during surges as the inundation alters the aquifer hydraulic heads. While these processes have been considered individually, here we consider the interplay between them and the longer-term impact of climate change, which is projected to increase the frequency of surges in the future. Using numerical modeling, the location of the lateral freshwater-saltwater interface and the total salt storage are calculated for single and repetitive surge events with different recurrence times to predict the long-term effect of surges. Results point to two novel mechanisms: (1) Following a single overwash event, salt storage in the aquifer peaks due to vertical salinization, and a second, lower peak occurs on a longer time scale. This second peak is due to the surge-induced rebound motion (seaward and then landward) of the interface. (2) The projected increase in surge frequency due to climate change can potentially induce long-term migration of the interface seaward, independent of a change in sea level, depending on the aquifer permeability. Together with this freshening effect, the total salt load in the aquifer increases due to repetitive vertical salinization. Thus, we show for the first time the combined effect of storm surges and climate change on both vertical and horizontal movement of salt in coastal aquifers, with important implications for water management along global coastlines.

Using Hydrologic Model Data to Inform Time-Lapse ERT Investigations of Coastal Processes,"Terra, C.; Slater, L.; Frederiks, R.; Paldor, A.; Michael, H.","Due to the effects of global climate change on the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones (Knutson et al., 2010), coastal communities are experiencing an increase in the rate of salinization of their freshwater resources. This study investigated the dynamics of saltwater intrusion that occur in the wake of storm surges by incorporating electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in hydrologic modeling of coastal saline transport at a field site on Assateague Island, MD. Due to the sensitivity of ERT to saline content, these methods were able to resolve the more fine-scale transport structures (e.g., density fingering) that hydrologic models often lack the spatial resolution to resolve. A model developed in HydroGeoSphere to investigate the inundation and flushing of the field site was used to simulate a synthetic ERT array to test the sensitivity of different ERT array sequences to gradual lateral changes in salinity by applying a petrophysical transform to the data to yield a spatial distribution of bulk resistivity values. These distributions were then analyzed in ResIPy to run synthetic forward models and invert them to investigate the lateral sensitivity of different array sequences to gradual changes in electrolytic salinity (and therefore, bulk resistivity). The compared ERT arrays were then tested with time lapse surveys at the field site to investigate their viability in a real-world saline environment.

Erosion and breaching of coastal barriers in a changing climate: Associated processes and implication for contamination of coastal aquifers,"Elsayed, S.M.; Oumeraci, H.; Goseberg, N.","Europe and many other countries all over the world are often surrounded by coastal defence systems (e.g. protective dunes and dykes) in order to protect coastal areas from threats of wave attack, storm surges and subsequent coastal floods. During moderate sea conditions, wave attack and coastal erosion is limited to nearshore areas and may only cause shore erosion. Under the same conditions, fresh groundwater, which is hydraulically interconnected with seawater, is in equilibrium with the laterally intruding seawaters. Such equilibrium prevails as long as the moderate sea level (MSL) and the hydrogeological conditions at the sea/land boundary are stationary. However, during extreme storm surges, the higher water levels may temporally threaten the coastal defence systems. In fact, shortwaves riding on the temporally rising sea level during storm surge events may directly runup, rundown and/or impact on barriers, possibly causing seaward erosion followed by lowering of barrierâs crest and hence wave overtopping or overflow through combined surge and waves. As a result, barriers may breach, inducing coastal inundation and subsequent vertical saltwater intrusion (VSWI) behind the breached barriers due to the vertical infiltration of inundating seawater into the fresh groundwater. In this study, a new integral physically based methodology is developed to reliably assess the possible implications of extreme storm surges on the safety of coastal barriers and the implications of possible breaching for contamination of coastal aquifers. The integral model is therefore capable to successively simulate breaching/overtopping of coastal barriers forced by storm surges as a hydraulic load, induced flood propagation in the hinterland and subsequent VSWI into coastal aquifers while considering the complexity of these processes and mutual interaction among them. The modelling methodology consists of an improved XBeach code (Roelvink et al., 2009) for hydro-morphodynamics unidirectionally coupled with the SEAWAT code (Langevin et al., 2008) for groundwater flow. The model is applied to a case study in northern Germany, showing that marine floods represent a serious threat to usability of coastal aquifers which are extremely important water resources. Outcomes of model application showed that a coastal flood event of a few hours may contaminate coastal aquifers for many decades, thus reducing the agricultural yield and hindering the sustainable development in coastal areas prone to coastal floods. This study represents, to the knowledge of the author, the first systematic research study that addresses the safety of natural coastal sandy barriers under extreme storm surge conditions together with the consequences of possible barrier breaching and overwash on subsequent flooding and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater. Moreover, it is probably the foremost study that attempts to mitigate storm-driven saltwater intrusion through the use and modelling of a subsurface drainage network. Besides improving the agricultural yield in coastal areas, the use of subsurface drainage network significantly reduces the natural remediation interval required for aquifers recovery after a coastal flood event. Moreover, it limits the vertical extent of the salt intrusion. The multiple flow domains and aspects discussed in this research make it a multidisciplinary study that is quite relevant for the coastal engineering community, for flood risk managers, for coastal hydrologists, for groundwater suppliers as well as for sustainable development planners.

Hydrologic remediation for the Deepwater Horizon incident drove ancillary primary production increase in coastal swamps,"Middleton, B.A.; Johnson, D.; Roberts, B.J.","As coastal wetlands subside worldwide, there is an urgency to understand the hydrologic drivers and dynamics of plant production and peat accretion. One incidental test of the effects of high rates of discharge on forested wetland production occurred in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident, in which all diversions in Louisiana were operated at or near their maximum discharge level for an extended period to keep offshore oil from threatened coastal wetlands. Davis Pond Diversion was operated at six times the normal discharge levels for almost 4months, so that Taxodium distichum swamps downstream of the diversion experienced greater inundation and lower salinity. After this remediation event in 2010, above-ground litter production increased by 2.7 times of production levels in 2007-2011. Biomass of the leaf and reproductive tissues of several species increased; wood litter was minimal and did not change during this period. Root production decreased in 2010 but subsequently returned to pre-remediation values in 2011. Both litter and root production remained high in the second growing season after hydrologic remediation. Annual tree growth (circumference increment) was not significantly altered by the remediation. The potential of freshwater pulses for regulating tidal swamp production is further supported by observations of higher T.distichum growth in lower salinity and/or pulsed environments across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Usage of freshwater pulses to manage altered estuaries deserves further consideration, particularly because the timing and duration of such pulses could influence both primary production and peat accretion.

Cost-effective management measures for coastal aquifers affected by saltwater intrusion and climate change,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Kushwaha, N.L.; Grismer, M.E.; Elbeltagi, A.; Kuriqi, A.","Sustainable management of natural water resources and food security in the face of changing climate conditions is critical to the livelihood of coastal communities. Increasing inundation and saltwater intrusion (SWI) will likely adversely affect agricultural production and the associated beach access for tourism. This study uses an integrated surface-ground water model to introduce a new approach for retardation of SWI that consists of placing aquifer fill materials along the existing shoreline using Coastal Land Reclamation (CLR). The modeling results suggest that the artificial aquifer materials could be designed to decrease SWI by increasing the infiltration area of coastal precipitation, collecting runoffs from the catchment area, and applying treated wastewater or desalinated brackish water-using coastal wave energy to reduce water treatment costs. The SEAWAT model was applied to verify that it correctly addressed Henry's problem and then applied to the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. In this study, to better inform Coastal Aquifer Management (CAM), we developed four modeling scenarios, namely, Physical Surface Barriers (PSB), including the artificial aquifer widths, permeability, and side slopes and recharge. In the base case scenario without artificial aquifer placement, results show that seawater levels would increase aquifer salinity and displace large amounts of presently available fresh groundwater. More specifically, for the Biscayne aquifer, approximately 0.50% of available fresh groundwater will be lost (that is, 41,192 m3) per km of the width of the aquifer considering the increasing seawater level. Furthermore, the results suggest that placing the PSB aquifer with a smaller permeability of <100 m per day at a width of approximately 615 m increases the available fresh groundwater by approximately 45.20 and 43.90% per km of shoreline, respectively. Similarly, decreasing the slope on the aquifer-ocean side and increasing the aquifer recharge will increase freshwater availability by about 43.90 and 44.50% per km of the aquifer. Finally, placing an aquifer fill along the shallow shoreline increases net revenues to the coastal community through increased agricultural production and possibly tourism that offset fill placement and water treatment costs. This study is useful for integrated management of coastal zones by delaying aquifer salinity, protecting fresh groundwater bodies, increasing agricultural lands, supporting surface water supplies by harvesting rainfall and flash flooding, and desalinating saline water using wave energy. Also, the feasibility of freshwater storage and costs for CAM is achieved in this study. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Sci.

Monitoring coastal marshes for persistent saltwater intrusion,"Kalcic, M.; Hall, C.; Russell, J.; Fletcher, R.","Saltwater flooding of coastal marshes by storm surge, rising sea level, and subsidence is a primary cause of wetland deterioration and habitat loss. The objective of this study is to provide resource managers with remote sensing products that support ecosystem-forecasting models requiring inundation data. This investigation employed time-series indices derived from 250-meter NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and 30-m Landsat imagery to map flooding and saltwater stress in the Sabine Basin in southwest Louisiana, before and after Hurricane Rita in 2005. After nearly 20 feet of storm surge inundated the area during Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Ike produced a storm surge of almost 14 feet in the same area and flooded areas as far as 30 miles inland. The study design of this investigation centered upon the use of vegetation and wetness (water) indicators to map flooded areas. The study team assigned a vegetation index to marsh areas of concomitant vegetation and water. We derived daily MODIS time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, and Normalized Difference Soil Index from the NASA Stennis Space Center Time Series Product Tool, which provides the capability to compute phenological parameters and performs temporal modeling at ecosystem scales. We estimated the extent of flooding as the percentage of time the MODIS index was water; i.e., below a certain threshold. The percentages indicate areas of persistent flooding over certain time intervals, thereby informing planners of areas with a high probability of conversion to open water. The study team used Landsat 5 and 7 data for the years 2004 through 2006 to produce an 8-day time series of vegetation and wetness indices. We evaluated these Landsat-based flood maps with lidar data and in situ elevation data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Louisiana Department of Natural Resources Coastwide Reference Monitoring System for the Sabine Basin. Finally, we combined salinity data collected in situ from the USGS and from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with our flooding estimates to map areas of persistent saltwater intrusion. The combination of these data are useful for habitat switching modules that predict the migration of marsh species from one salinity regime to another from estimates of the annual percent inundation and the mean annual salinity.

"Distribution, origin, and resource-management implications of ground-water salinity along the western margin of the Chesapeake Bay impact structure in eastern Virginia","McFarland, E.R.; Bruce, T.S.","Stratified unconsolidated sediments that compose a regionally extensive system of aquifers and confining units beneath the Virginia Coastal Plain contain saltwater approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) landward of its normally expected position along the coast. Part of the Chesapeake Bay impact structure (formed by the collision of a large asteroid or comet) underlies the Virginia Coastal Plain. The impact severely disrupted preexisting sediments, and its effects are still influencing the regional ground-water flow. Geologic and hydrologic evidence indicates that the impact structure contains seawater emplaced during a regional inundation approximately 2 million years ago, along with much older seawater and evaporative brine emplaced potentially as far back as the impact event 35 million years ago. With emergence of the coastal plain and resumption of ground-water recharge during the past 2 million years, freshwater flushing displaced residual seawater across the region but was impeded across the impact structure by the clayey Chickahominy Formation. Flushing took place laterally along the crater outer margin through underlying crater-fill sediments, followed by upward leakage and surface discharge to areas outside of the crater. Saltwater within the impact structure maintained its present position even as flushing outside of the impact structure extended in places nearly to the edge of the continental shelf during the Pleistocene glacial maximum of 18,000 years ago. Sea level has since risen to its present position, and the residual seawater has merged with the modern ocean along an inverted and unstable transition zone along the western margin of the impact structure that separates fresh ground water to the west from saltwater to the east. During the past century, hydraulic gradients have been greatly increased and flow has been redirected landward across regional cones of depression centered on industrial pumping centers located outside of the impact structure. Saltwater intrusion across regional distances from the impact structure has not taken place, however, because most of the ground water now present was emplaced prior to the onset of heavy pumping. Because saltwater within the impact structure maintained its present position for millennia during freshwater flushing prior to pumping, a potentially very long timeframe could be required for regional saltwater intrusion to occur even under present gradients. In contrast, localized saltwater movement along the western margin of the impact structure is possible across relatively short distances because of municipal withdrawals being made from within the saltwater transition zone. Major increases in withdrawal and desalinization of brackish ground water from the transition zone are being projected to address rapidly growing demands for public supplies during the coming several decades. Water-supply planning is challenged, however, by future increases in ground-water salinity that are difficult to estimate because of complex hydrogeologic controls and withdrawal-induced effects within the transition zone. A detailed local-scale characterization of hydrologic conditions along the western margin will be critical to assessment of the potential for saltwater movement.",2006,,US Geol. Surv.

The use of basic research in wetland management decisions,"Mendelssohn, I.A.; McKee, K.L.","Although brackish marshes can be negatively affected by both saltwater intrusion and subsidence, the ability to restore a deteriorated brackish marsh in Louisiana was not controlled by salinity, but rather by the degree of plant inundation and soil reduction resulting from hydrology and lowered marsh surface elevation.

Monitoring hurricane effects on aquifer salinity using ALSM,"Starek, M.; Sedighi, A.","During the Atlantic hurricane season of 2004, the Florida Pan Handle, Gulf Coast region, was impacted directly by three hurricanes within approximately a one-month time period. The short temporal span between impacts coupled with the severity of the storms resulted in drastic changes to the littoral zone geomorphology including extensive shoreline erosion and accretion that directly affected the subsurface hydrogeologic environment. The most important direct physical effects of a hurricane are the following: coastal erosion, shoreline inundation owing to higher than normal tide levels plus increased temporary surge levels during storms, and saltwater intrusion primarily into estuaries and groundwater aquifers. Erosion and deposition during the hurricane change the elevation, which causes change in the position of shoreline. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sea level inundation due to the hurricanes on the near shore subsurface freshwater-saltwater interface. By utilizing high-resolution Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM) altimetry data acquired shortly before and after the three major hurricane landfalls, the change in shoreline topography was estimated to determine both small-scale and large-scale horizontal encroachment and volumetric change in shoreline. This information was used to develop a before and after variable density groundwater flow model to determine the impact of the hurricanes on the subsurface saltwater-freshwater interface. SEAWAT (Langevin 2001; Guo and Langevin 2002), which simulates three-dimensional, variable-density groundwater flow following a modular structure similar to MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh 1988), was selected to represent the saltwater-freshwater interface in this investigation.",2006,,Am.

An analysis of atlantic white cedar (ides (L.) B.S.P.) tree rings as indicators of ghost forest development in a globally threatened ecosystem,"Doyle, J.M.; Earley, K.E.; Atkinson, R.B.","Atlantic White Cedar (AWC) swamps are a globally threatened type of wetland ecosystem and are a new form of ghost forest in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. Hydrogeomorphic regimes foster peat formation, resulting in unique biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. Our sites include regimes that are exposed to sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater intrusion, yet other sites are protected by higher elevations. In this study, we evaluated climatic variables to discern differences in tree ring formation as an indicator of growth among nine stands including microtidal, oligohaline sites as well as other protected areas which served as a control. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used, and series were divided into two sub-chronologies, 1895 to 1971 (early) and 1972 to 2018 (recent). AWC growth in response to precipitation parameters, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were largely non-significant but were somewhat reversed among sub-chronologies. Early correlations were primarily negatively correlated with PDSI, while recent correlations were mostly positive, which suggests that even though inundation may reduce photosynthate availability for growth, precipitation has begun to increase growth by alleviating osmotic and toxic stresses associated with seawater. Analysis of climatic variables and tree growth at the reference site found that other anthropogenic stressors associated with ditching exert a greater influence. Hurricane impacts on tree growth exhibited no lasting negative effects; however, an AWC ghost forest report from New Jersey connected mortality to a hurricane. Hydrogeomorphic regimes may delay rather than eliminate risks associated with sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Effect of cut-off wall on freshwater storage in small islands considering ocean surge inundation,"Yang, J.; Graf, T.; Luo, J.; Lu, C.","Freshwater lenses (FWL) underneath islands are often unique freshwater resources. Constructing cut-off walls in coastal islands to increase the FWL size has been proposed and tested effective. Meanwhile, seawater inundation induced by ocean surges on low-lying islands can cause the vertical intrusion of saltwater and salinization of FWL. Constructing cut-off walls can influence the post-inundation recovery once the FWL is salinized during the inundation. This influence has not been investigated and considered when discussing the feasibility of cut-off walls. In this study, we numerically simulated an ocean-surge inundation on a 2D, vertically oriented island constructed with a cut-off wall, using a coupled surfaceâsubsurface approach. We varied the aquifer permeability and the depth of the cut-off wall. The effect of the cut-off wall on FWL was quantitatively assessed in terms of FWL volume and flushing time. The results show that the cut-off wall can significantly increase the volume of FWL, confirming previous studies, especially when it is constructed in high-permeability (>10â10.5 m2) islands and deeper. In addition, the cut-off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40% during the inundation. Therefore, the recovery tends to be accelerated in the early stage, and in islands of low & intermediate permeability. However, the average recovery in high-permeability islands can be slowed down, because the cut-off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is harder for flushing. As a first attempt to assess the feasibility of the cut-off wall construction from the perspective of FWL recovery, our study is important for the management of freshwater on islands facing the risk of ocean-surge inundation.

Sea-level rise impacts on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers: Review and integration,"Ketabchi, H.; Mahmoodzadeh, D.; Ataie-Ashtiani, B.; Simmons, C.T.","Sea-level rise (SLR) influences groundwater hydraulics and in particular seawater intrusion (SWI) in many coastal aquifers. The quantification of the combined and relative impacts of influential factors on SWI has not previously been considered in coastal aquifers. In the present study, a systematic review of the available literature on this topic is first provided. Then, the potential remaining challenges are scrutinized. Open questions on the effects of more realistic complexities such as gradual SLR, parameter uncertainties, and the associated influences in decision-making models are issues requiring further investigation.We assess and quantify the seawater toe location under the impacts of SLR in combination with recharge rate variations, land-surface inundation (LSI) due to SLR, aquifer bed slope variation, and changing landward boundary conditions (LWBCs). This is the first study to include all of these factors in a single analysis framework. Both analytical and numerical models are used for these sensitivity assessments. It is demonstrated that (1) LSI caused by SLR has a significant incremental impact on the seawater toe location, especially in the flatter coasts and the flux-controlled (FC) LWBCs, however this impact is less than the reported orders of magnitude differences which were estimated using only analytical solutions; (2) LWBCs significantly influence the SLR impacts under almost all conditions considered in this study; (3) The main controlling factors of seawater toe location are the magnitudes of fresh groundwater discharge to sea and recharge rate. Regional freshwater flux entering from the landward boundary and the groundwater hydraulic gradient are the major contributors of fresh groundwater discharge to sea for both FC and head-controlled (HC) systems, respectively; (4) A larger response of the aquifer and larger seawater toe location changes are demonstrable for a larger ratio of the aquifer thickness to the aquifer length particularly in the HC systems; (5) The lowest sensitivity of seawater toe location is found for the density difference ratio of the seawater and freshwater, and also for the aquifer bed slope; (6) The early-time observations show seawater fingers below the inundated lands due to SLR which are diminished and ultimately extinguished; and (7) A less than 2% reversal effect on the seawater toe location after overshoot mechanism is observed in the transient simulations which suggests that this mechanism is an insignificant and impractical factor compared to other more significant factors.

Probabilistic numerical assessment of seawater intrusion overshoot in heterogeneous coastal aquifers,"Ketabchi, H.; Jahangir, M.S.","Seawater intrusion is considered as one of the main hazards to coastal aquifers. In coastal aquifers, an overshoot occurs when the freshwaterâsaltwater interface exceeds the steady state position due to sea level rise (SLR). Hence, it is considered a more critical state than the terminal state. In the present study, overshoot is characterized in an unconfined, heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer. For a more accurate evaluation, overshoot is investigated using three indicators, seawater toe, salinized volume, and effective dispersivity. In combination with the associated land surface inundation (LSI) impact, two types of SLR are assumed, gradual SLR (GSLR) and instantaneous SLR (ISLR). For addressing the heterogeneity of the aquifer, 50 sets of log-normally-distributed conductivity fields using a spherical correlation function are generated for each of the scenarios. Heterogeneity of the aquifer is modeled using the variance of conductivity field (Ïlnk2) and the longitudinal correlation length (Î»x). Three different values of 0.5, 1, and 2 are assumed for Ïlnk2 where two values of 20Â m and 40Â m are assigned to Î»x. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, it is shown that (1) in both GSLR and ISLR scenarios, the overshoot is observed for both the seawater toe and the salinized volume where LSI is not assumed; (2) the SLR impact is overshadowed by the significance of conductivity field properties in heterogeneous scenarios; (3) Ïlnk2 plays a more discernible role in the overshoot characteristics compared to Î»x; (4) a realistic assumption of GSLR results in lower overshoot occurrence probability. These observations are interpreted using the associated behavior of the flow field in the aquifer and the time needed for hydraulic pressures in this field to re-equilibrate after SLR.

How important is the impact of land-surface inundation on seawater intrusion caused by sea-level rise?,"Ataie-Ashtiani, B.; Werner, A.D.; Simmons, C.T.; Morgan, L.K.; Lu, C.","The influence of sea-level rise (SLR) on seawater intrusion (SWI) has been the subject of several publications, which consider collectively a range of functional relationships within various hydrogeological and SLR settings. Most of the recent generalized analyses of SWI under SLR neglect land-surface inundation (LSI) by seawater. A simple analytical method is applied to quantitatively assess the influence and importance of LSI on SLR-SWI problems under idealized conditions. The results demonstrate that LSI induces significantly more extensive SWI, with inland penetration up to an order of magnitude larger in the worst case, compared to the effects of pressure changes at the shoreline in unconfined coastal aquifers with realistic parameters. The study also outlines some of the remaining research challenges in related areas, concluding that LSI impacts are among other important research questions regarding the SLR-SWI problems that have not been addressed, including the effects of aquifer heterogeneities, real-world three dimensionality, and mitigation measures.

Influence of aquifer heterogeneity on sea level rise-induced seawater intrusion: A probabilistic approach,"Ketabchi, H.; Jahangir, M.S.","Seawater intrusion (SWI) is influenced by a variety of coastal phenomena, such as sea level rise (SLR), inundation of low-lying coastal regions, coastal storms, recharge rate variations, and pumping-induced saltwater upconing. Quantification of the influence of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field on SWI combined with SLR, land-surface inundation, and recharge rate variations in an unconfined aquifer is the main objective of the present study. The principal SWI indicators used in this study are length of the SWI wedge, seawater volume, and weighted average transition zone width. Characterized by the hydraulic conductivity field variance (Ïlnk2), the longitudinal correlation length (Î»x), the type of SLR (gradual or instantaneous SLR), the land-surface inundation consideration, and the recharge rate variations, 72 scenarios have been introduced, and for each of them, 50 sets of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields have been generated. Based on two approaches, namely ensemble Monte-Carlo and a Bayesian framework, it is demonstrated that: (1) the land-surface inundation consideration increases the SWI wedge length and the seawater volume regardless of the type of SLR, while it decreases the weighted average transition zone width in gradual SLR scenarios; (2) Î»x has a more significant impact on SWI characteristics compared to Ïlnk2; (3) increasing the degree of aquifer heterogeneity results in larger effective dispersion values; (4) Numerical bootstrapping suggests that the introduced Bayesian framework could be adopted as an alternative to computationally demanding methods such as bootstrapping for stochastic analysis of SWI; (5) Reliability analysis indicates the general belief that considering the heterogeneity decreases the SWI wedge length and the seawater volume, while increases the transition zone width compared to the homogeneous modeling is associated with huge amounts of uncertainty proportional to the aquifer heterogeneity itself; and (6) the results show that the impact of heterogeneity on the SWI indicators is similar under different recharge rates.

Sea-level rise: Implications for water resources management,"Hay, J.E.; Mimura, N.","Globally, sea level has been rising for more than the last one hundred years, and is expected to do so into the foreseeable future, and at an accelerating rate. The direct influences of sea-level rise on water resources come principally from the following: new or accelerated coastal erosion; more extensive coastal inundation and higher levels of sea flooding; increases in the landward reach of sea waves and storm surges; seawater intrusion into surface waters and coastal aquifers; and further encroachment of tidal waters into estuaries and coastal river systems. The impacts of sea-level rise are likely to be felt disproportionately in certain areas, reflecting both natural and socio-economic factors that enhance the levels of risks. The opportunity to learn about the likely nature of, and most appropriate adaptation to, the anticipated impacts of sea-level rise on water resources is arguably best developed in rapidly subsiding coastal areas, and especially in low-lying deltas where subsidence rates are typically much larger than the historic rise in global mean sea level. Significantly, such areas are often major centres of population and of economic activity, thereby highlighting the human dimensions of sea-level rise. Sound management of the risks to water resources associated with sea-level rise requires enhancing adaptive capacity, mainstreaming adaptation, harmonizing responses to extreme events, variability and long-term change and strengthening regional and international cooperation and coordination. In this regard, the policies and initiatives of international organisations are not always entirely consistent with the needs of developing countries. Â© Springer 2005.",2005,,Mitigation Adapt.

Data analysis and integrated modeling of compound flooding impacts on coastal drainage infrastructure under a changing climate,"Sangsefidi, Y.; Bagheri, K.; Davani, H.; Merrifield, M.","Low-lying coastal areas are susceptible to multiple types of flooding from marine, subsurface, and surface sources. The co-occurrence of a rainfall event with high sea level, which raises coastal groundwater tables conjointly, may result in a compound flooding event, which could be much more widespread and dangerous than that of an individual flooding source. Focusing on Imperial Beach as a low-elevation coastal community in California, this paper provides a generalized methodology to determine the vulnerability of coastal stormdrain systems to compound seawater, groundwater, and stormwater flooding under a changing climate. Although marine inundation by itself is expected to flood only 7% of the study area by 2100 under the most pessimistic scenario (i.e. 2 m rise), our results show that more than 20% of the study area's subterranean stormdrain system is already at the risk of subsurface flooding at current sea levels. While marine inundation is a concern near the coastline as sea level rises, the results show that seawater intrusion into the stormdrain system can impact areas kilometers away from the coastline. The consequences of sea-level rise (SLR) can be exacerbated by an under-resourced stormdrain system, caused by groundwater infiltration through system defects. As such, by a 2 m rise in current sea-level, the flooding volume may double in an ideal system (i.e., no defects) while this ratio can increase six fold in a slightly defective stormdrain system (with 0.25 % porosity systemwide). The continuous simulations of the stormdrain system performance indicate that flood events will be more destructive and frequent under these circumstances. Â© 2022 The Author(s)",2023,,J.

Coastal Disasters and Mitigation Measures,"Neelamani, S.","The increased population density in the coastal areas has made the coast more vulnerable for disaster and for sustainable development of coastal infrastructures. With increase in greenhouse gas emission, global warming, accelerated melting of polar ice and sea level rise, the vulnerability for coastal disaster is expected to magnify in the future. The global average temperature of the air is expected to increase anywhere from 2 to 6 degree C by 2100, depends on the pathway of greenhouse gas emission and the sea level is expected to rise from 0.5 to 1.0Â m by 2100. This would create permanent inundation of the coastal area and the associated degradation and damage of coastal infrastructures. It is expected that the intensity and frequency of cyclone activities would increase, which would accelerate coastal erosion. It is expected that many ground water resources in coastal cities will face more seawater intrusion problems. The seawater acidification would increase with accelerated bleaching of coral reefs and deterioration of mangroves. The increase in construction of dams across rivers would reduce the sediment flow from river to sea, which will fuel the coastal erosion issues. A clear understanding of all these issues are very important and suitable mitigation measures need to be adopted. Do nothing/defend/adopt and retrieve are important management frameworks to take care of the future coastal disasters. Reduce/reuse and recycle are other important frameworks to be followed by stakeholders. Different aspects of these frameworks are discussed in this manuscript.

"Differences in impacts of Hurricane Sandy on freshwater swamps on the Delmarva Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic Coast, USA","Middleton, B.A.","Hurricane wind and saltwater surge may have different influences on the subsequent composition of forests. During Hurricane Sandy, while damaging winds were highest near landfall in New Jersey, inundation occurred along the entire eastern seaboard from Georgia to Maine. In this study, a comparison of damage from salinity intrusion vs. wind/surge was recorded in swamps of the Delmarva Peninsula along the Pocomoke (MD) and Nanticoke (DE) Rivers, south of the most intense wind damage. Hickory Point Cypress Swamp (Hickory) was closest to the Chesapeake Bay and may have been subjected to a salinity surge as evidenced by elevated salinity levels at a gage upstream of this swamp (storm salinity. = 13.1. ppt at Nassawango Creek, Snow Hill, Maryland). After Hurricane Sandy, 8% of the standing trees died at Hickory including Acer rubrum, Amelanchier laevis, Ilex spp., and Taxodium distichum. In certain plots of Hickory, up to 25% of the standing trees were dead, corresponding with high soil salinity. The most important variables related to structural tree damage were soil salinity and proximity to the Atlantic coast as based on Stepwise Regression and NMDS procedures. Wind damage was mostly restricted to broken branches although tipped-up trees were found at Hickory, Whiton and Porter (species: Liquidamabar styraciflua, Pinus taeda, Populus deltoides, Quercus pagoda and Ilex spp.). These trees fell mostly in an east or east-southeast direction (88-107Â°) in keeping with the wind direction of Hurricane Sandy on the Delmarva Peninsula. Coastal restoration and management can be informed by the specific differences in hurricane damage to vegetation by salt vs. wind. Â© 2015.",2016,,Ecol.

"Understanding the Impacts of Climate Change: an Analysis of Inundation, Marsh Elevation, and Plant Communities in a Tidal Freshwater Marsh","Delgado, P.; Hensel, P.; Baldwin, A.","Tidal freshwater marshes around the world face an uncertain future with increasing water levels, salinity intrusion, and temperature and precipitation shifts associated with climate change. Due to the characteristic abundance of both annual and perennial species in these habitats, even small increases in early growing season water levels may reduce seed germination, seedling establishment, and late-season plant cover, decreasing overall species abundance and productivity. This study looks at the distribution of tidal freshwater marsh plant species at Jug Bay, Patuxent River (Chesapeake Bay, USA), with respect to intertidal elevation, and the relationship between inundation early in the growing season and peak plant cover to better understand the potential impacts and marsh responses to increased inundation. Results show that 62% of marsh plant species are distributed at elevations around mean high water and are characterized by narrow elevation ranges in contrast with species growing at lower elevations. In addition, the frequency and duration of inundation and water depth to which the marsh was exposed to, prior to the growing season (March 15âMay 15), negatively affected peak plant cover (measured in end-June to mid-July) after a threshold value was reached. For example, 36 and 55% decreases in peak plant cover were observed after duration of inundation threshold values of 25 and 36% was reached for annual and perennial species, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that plant communities of tidal freshwater marshes are sensitive to even small systematic changes in inundation, which may affect species abundance and richness as well as overall wetland resiliency to climate change.

"Impacts of Storm Surge Barriers on Drag, Mixing, and Exchange Flow in a Partially Mixed Estuary","Ralston, D.K.","Storm surge barriers are increasingly being considered as risk mitigation measures for coastal population centers. During non-storm periods, permanent barrier infrastructure reduces the flow cross-sectional area and affects tidal exchange. Effects of barrier structures on estuarine tidal and salinity dynamics have not been extensively examined, particularly for partially mixed estuaries. A nested, high-resolution model is used to characterize impacts of a potential storm surge barrier near the mouth of the Hudson River estuary. Maximum tidal velocities through barrier openings are more than double those in the base case. Landward of the barrier, tidal amplitude decreases on average by about 6% due to increased drag. The drag coefficient with the barrier is about 5 times greater than the base case due primarily to form drag from flow separation at barrier structures rather than increased bottom friction. The form drag scales with barrier geometry similar to previous studies of flow around headlands. Tidal water levels are reduced particularly during spring tides, such that marsh inundation frequency is reduced up to 25%. Strong tidal velocities through barrier openings enhance salinity mixing locally, but overall mixing in the estuary decreases due to reduced tidal velocities. Correspondingly, stratification decreases near the barrier and increases landward in the estuary. The salinity intrusion length increases by 5%â15% depending on discharge due to the decreased mixing and increased exchange flow. Exchange flow increases near the barrier due reflux into the lower layer with the increased mixing, which has the potential to increase estuarine residence times. Â© 2022. American Geophysical Union.

Does increased salinity reduce functional depth tolerance of four non-halophytic wetland macrophyte species?,"Johns, C.; Ramsey, M.; Bell, D.; Vaughton, G.","Rapid growth in height is an important mechanism used by many emergent wetland macrophytes to withstand water depth increases, particularly in species unable to maintain sufficient rates of photosynthesis and gas exchange for long-term survival underwater. However, increases in salinity can reduce growth rates and above-ground biomass production in non-halophytic macrophytes and this may reduce their inundation tolerance. We tested this hypothesis by comparing growth responses of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, Paspalum distichum L., Eleocharis equisetina C.Presl and Bolboschoenus caldwellii (V.J.Cook) SojÃ¡k at three depths (5, 20 and 60cm) across four salinity treatments (200, 2500, 5000 and 10000mgL-1). Increases in depth had negative effects on the growth of all four species. The three emergent wetland macrophyte species (P. distichum, E. equisetina and B. caldwellii) grew more rapidly, produced more above-ground biomass, and/or maintained positive growth rates at greater depths in the lower salinity treatments than at higher salinities. The terrestrial grass species, C. dactylon, displayed negligible growth when waterlogged and where biomass decreased significantly with depth, there were no significant differences in biomass between the salinity treatments. We conclude that increases in salinity reduced the ability of the three emergent wetland macrophyte species to withstand increases in water depth. The potential depth ranges of these species are therefore likely to change within wetlands if salinisation occurs. Specifically, the habitat ranges of these species are likely to contract and shift towards the shallower, less-frequently flooded limits of their current ranges as salinity levels become limiting to growth.

Effect of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation,"Yu, X.; Xin, P.; Hong, L.","Ocean surge inundation occurs frequently in low-lying coastal areas worldwide. While studies have been conducted to examine aquifer salinization and recovery caused by ocean surge inundation, evaporation is predominantly overlooked. Based on numerical simulations considering variably saturated, density-dependent pore-water flow and salt transport, this study examines the combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization in coastal unconfined aquifers. The results show that evaporation enhances soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation. Due to evaporation-induced water uptake, the downward movement of salt is weakened and the salt from the ocean surge inundation is significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone. The pore-water salinity in the shallow soil layer is increased by soil evaporation, particularly in the low-elevation area with longer seawater inundation. The sensitive analysis shows that the evaporation-enhanced soil salinization is more remarkable for silt-loam and clay-loam aquifers rather than sandy-loam aquifers. A higher mean sea level favors salt trapping in the shallow soil layer of aquifers. These results demonstrate the importance of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation, and that could be considered in future studies. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,J.

The response of semi-arid ephemeral wetland plants to flooding: Linking water use to hydrological processes,"Drake, P.L.; Coleman, B.F.; Vogwill, R.","Evergreen plants inhabiting ephemeral wetlands endure long dry spells interspersed with periods of flooding (or inundation). Inundation events are likely to be important for plant water use and growth, but few studies have linked the physiology of plants to hydrological processes during flood. We investigated the link between changes in the soil physical environment and plant water use traits in a stand of Casuarina obesa Miq and Melaleuca strobophylla Barlow trees during a controlled inundation event at Toolibin Lake. Toolibin Lake is an internationally recognized ephemeral wetland, which is under threat from altered hydrology and salinization. During flood, the velocity of water movement through the clay-dominated soil profile suggested that macropores and plant root preferential flow paths aided water distribution. C.obesa was more capable than M.strobophylla to capitalize on the inundation event, suggesting preferential use of macropore water and a concentration of roots near the soil surface. Sap flux (QS) and tree diameter (Ï{symbol}) were interdependent and there was a correlation between increasing Ï{symbol} and increasing pre-dawn leaf water potential (Î¨pd). These observations link the movement of water through the soil profile with changes in tree water use and tree girth in C.obesa and M.strobophylla. Changes in the soil physical environment observed in this study also highlight the risks associated with hydrological management in salinity-affected ecosystems. Although floods provide fresh water to the root zone of trees, the resulting recharge may also elevate saline groundwater into the region of plant water uptake.

Salt Transport Under Tide and Evaporation in a Subtropical Wetland: Field Monitoring and Numerical Simulation,"Liu, Y.; Zhang, C.; Liu, X.; Li, C.; Sheuermann, A.; Xin, P.; Li, L.; Lockington, D.A.","Tidal wetland ecosystems are sensitive to porewater salinity dynamics. However, it is unclear how salts move and distribute in these wetlands, particularly how the salts accumulated by evaporation get removed from the wetland soil, so that the salinity levels may stabilize to accommodate vegetation. We conducted a combined field and modeling study to identify the porewater flow and salinity patterns in a subtropical wetland subjected to tidal inundation and evaporation. Measured and simulated salinity contours indicated the formation of hypersaline porewater plumes in the upper intertidal zone and the fresher porewater zones with salinity close to that of seawater near the creek and in the supratidal zone. Simulations indicated the discharge of the hypersaline upper intertidal porewater to the creek with a discharge pathway developed under the fresher near-creek porewater zone, and this was further confirmed by the field-observed significant salinity gradient under the creek. Our model suggested that both water and salt discharge from the wetland soil occurred predominantly at the creek bank and creek bed. The porewater discharge is more intensive through the creek bank than the creek bed, while the salt discharge across both the creek bank and creek bed was comparable due to the much higher salinity level under the creek bed. Salt discharge driven by density gradients and tidal-induced porewater circulation provides a mechanism for removing salts accumulated in the upper intertidal zone due to evaporation and could prevent salt flat formation and marsh plants dieback.

Groundwater-surface water interactions in a large semi-arid floodplain: Implications for salinity management,"Lamontagne, S.; Leaney, F.W.; Herczeg, A.L.","Flow regulation and water diversion for irrigation have considerably impacted the exchange of surface water between the Murray River and its floodplains. However, the way in which river regulation has impacted groundwater-surface water interactions is not completely understood, especially in regards to the salinization and accompanying vegetation dieback currently occurring in many of the floodplains. Groundwater-surface water interactions were studied over a 2 year period in the riparian area of a large floodplain (Hattah-Kulkyne, Victoria) using a combination of piezometric surface monitoring and environmental tracers (Cl-, Î´2H, and Î´ 18O). Despite being located in a local and regional groundwater discharge zone, the Murray River is a losing stream under low flow conditions at Hattah-Kulkyne. The discharge zone for local groundwater, regional groundwater and bank recharge is in the floodplain within â¼1 km of the river and is probably driven by high rates of transpiration by the riparian Eucalyptus camaldulensis woodland. Environmental tracers data suggest that the origin of groundwater is principally bank recharge in the riparian zone and a combination of diffuse rainfall recharge and localized floodwater recharge elsewhere in the floodplain. Although the Murray River was losing under low flows, bank discharge occurred during some flood recession periods. The way in which the water table responded to changes in river level was a function of the type of stream bank present, with point bars providing a better connection to the alluvial aquifer than the more common clay-lined banks. Understanding the spatial variability in the hydraulic connection with the river channel and in vertical recharge following inundations will be critical to design effective salinity remediation strategies for large semi-arid floodplains.

Observed tree mortality rates at study sites in the Maurepas swamp are very high (up to 100% tree mortality in 11 years) and basal area decreased with average salinities of < 1 ppt. Habitat classification, vegetation productivity and mortality, and surface elevation changes show a clear trajectory from stagnant, nearly permanently flooded forests with broken canopy to degraded forests with sparse baldcypress and dominated by herbaceous species and open water to open water habitat for most of the Maurepas swamp without introduction of fresh water to combat saltwater intrusion and stimulate productivity and accretion.

Our study utilized established sites along salinity and flooding gradients in the United States of Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina. We hypothesized that environmental variables, namely salinity and water level, as well as distance between sites would be correlated with baldcypress-associated rhizosphere and root endosphere bacterial communities. We found that geographic distance correlated with rhizosphere but not root endosphere bacterial communities, suggesting that the trees may have stabilized their endosphere communities via recruitment of a more specific suite of taxa from the surrounding soil. Mean water level, mean salinity, and the volume of woody debris were associated with both endosphere and rhizosphere bacterial communities in baldcypress trees.

"Impact of hydrological alterations on river-groundwater exchange and water quality in a semi-arid area: Nueces River, Texas","Murgulet, D.; Murgulet, V.; Spalt, N.; Douglas, A.; Hay, R.G.","There is a lack of understanding and methods for assessing the effects of anthropogenic disruptions, (i.e. river fragmentation due to dam construction) on the extent and degree of groundwater-surface water interaction and geochemical processes affecting the quality of water in semi-arid, coastal catchments. This study applied a novel combination of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and elemental and isotope geochemistry in a coastal river disturbed by extended drought and periodic flooding due to the operation of multiple dams. Geochemical analyses show that the saltwater barrier causes an increase in salinity in surface water in the downstream river as a result of limited freshwater inflows, strong evaporation effects on shallow groundwater and mostly stagnant river water, and is not due to saltwater intrusion by tidal flooding. Discharge from bank storage is dominant (~Â 84%) in the downstream fragment and its contribution could increase salinity levels within the hyporheic zone and surface water. When surface water levels go up due to upstream freshwater releases the river temporarily displaces high salinity water trapped in the hyporheic zone to the underlying aquifer. Geochemical modeling shows a higher contribution of distant and deeper groundwater (~Â 40%) in the upstream river and lower discharge from bank storage (~Â 13%) through the hyporheic zone. Recharge from bank storage is a source of high salt to both upstream and downstream portions of the river but its contribution is higher below the dam. Continuous ERT imaging of the river bed complements geochemistry findings and indicate that while lithologically similar, downstream of the dam, the shallow aquifer is affected by salinization while fresher water saturates the aquifer in the upstream fragment. The relative contribution of flows (i.e. surface water releases or groundwater discharge) as related to the river fragmentation control changes of streamwater chemistry and likely impact the interpretation of seasonal trends.

The objective of our study was to test specific predictions for the impact of an extreme drought in 2011/2012, extreme flooding in 2017, and long-term changes by comparing recent and historical mussel community data from an understudied yet biodiverse region of Texas, USA. Drought had the most detrimental impact leading to community-wide declines, indicated by a significant decline of abundances, species richness and occupied sites. Flooding led to shifts in community composition and spatial distribution. Both severe declines and a distinct community shift occurred over the long-term, where the dominance of species shifted to those more tolerable of disturbance. Saltwater intrusion likely caused a significant increase post-flood of a species known to be tolerant of brackish water (Glebula rotundata). The impact of flooding was likely buffered by connectivity with extensive backwater areas, forming large wetlands, which may act as crucial refuges for mussels during extreme climatic events. Thus, protecting wetlands is crucial to protect freshwater mussels and the ecosystem services they provide.

Estimate of decadal-scale riverbed deformation and bed-load sediment transport during flood events in the lowermost Mississippi River,"Wu, C.-Y.; Mossa, J.; Jaeger, J.M.","Riverbed changes are important to applications in engineering in the environment, such as navigation, salt-water intrusion and habitat quality. This study employed decadal hydrographic data over the past 50 years (1963â2013), as well as daily water stages and discharges to outline the long-term channel morphological changes and bed-load sediments deposited by floods in the lowermost Mississippi River (LMR). To generate accurate bathymetric digital elevation models (DEMs), we interpolated the hydrographic survey in a channel-centred coordinate system by employing ordinary kriging with anisotropy. Riverbed deformations were estimated by subtracting the elevations between DEMs at two different times to generate a series of DoDs (DEM of difference). The results from DoDs exhibit temporal riverbed change patterns and also reveal net degradation after the completion of the Old River Control Structure in 1963, except for the period 1992â2004. Spatially, over 32% of the total area experienced continuous erosion, with only 0.4% having continuous aggradation. Historical erosion over the past 50 years could be removing the alluvial veneer in sections of the river, and exposing more non-alluvial sediments, particularly between river kilometre RK 230 and RK 40. Our analysis also shows that riverbed deformation patterns are mainly controlled by flood events, backwater effects, as well as the drawdown effect near the Bonnet CarrÃ© spillway. In this study, we also examine whether the LMR traps bed-load sediment under flood conditions. The probability distribution estimated by Monte Carlo simulation suggests only low amounts of bed-load sediments are deposited on the channel bed during floods. Spatially, the short-term bed-load erosion/deposition pattern roughly matches the decadal-scale riverbed deformation estimated from DoDs. Moreover, this study finds that the trends between the thalweg changes and riverbed deformation are similar, suggesting that both of these patterns are controlled by the same factors.

Micro-positron emission tomography for measuring sub-core scale single and multiphase transport parameters in porous media,"Zahasky, C.; Benson, S.M.","Accurate descriptions of heterogeneity in porous media are important for understanding and modeling single phase (e.g. contaminant transport, saltwater intrusion) and multiphase (e.g. geologic carbon storage, enhanced oil recovery) transport problems. Application of medical imaging to experimentally quantify these processes has led to significant progress in material characterization and understanding fluid transport behavior at laboratory scales. While widely utilized in cancer diagnosis and management, cardiology, and neurology, positron emission tomography (PET) has had relatively limited applications in earth science. This study utilizes a small-bore micro-PET scanner to image and quantify the transport behavior of pulses of a conservative aqueous radiotracer injected during single and multiphase flow experiments in two heterogeneous Berea sandstone cores. The cores are discretized into axial-parallel streamtubes, and using the reconstructed micro-PET data, expressions are derived from spatial moment analysis for calculating sub-core tracer flux and pore water velocity. Using the flux and velocity measurements, it is possible to calculate porosity and saturation from volumetric flux balance, and calculate permeability and water relative permeability from Darcy's law. Second spatial moment analysis enables measurement of sub-core solute dispersion during both single phase and multiphase experiments. A numerical simulation model is developed to verify the assumptions of the streamtube dimension reduction technique. A variation of the reactor ratio is presented as a diagnostic metric to efficiently determine the validity of the streamtube approximation in core and column-scale experiments. This study introduces a new method to quantify sub-core permeability, relative permeability, and dispersion. These experimental and analytical methods provide a foundation for future work on experimental measurements of differences in transport behavior across scales. Â© 2018",2018,,Adv.

Impacts of Hurricane Michael on Watershed Hydrology: A Case Study in the Southeastern United States,"Worley, E.; Liu, N.; Sun, G.; Norman, S.P.; Christie, W.M.; Gavazzi, M.; Boggs, J.; McNulty, S.G.","Hurricanes are one of the most significant threats to coastal plain forest ecosystems and urban communities of the southeastern U.S., but their implications for watershed hydrology are unclear. Hurricanes have the potential to alter water balances, causing extensive flooding, biogeo-chemical cycle disruption, and water quality degradation, saltwater intrusion, and increased nutrient sedimentation export in coastal watersheds. This case study focused on Hurricane Michael, a recent catastrophic event that impacted the Gulf coast, the Florida panhandle, southwestern Geor-gia, and southeastern Alabama. Through empirical (Double Mass Curve) and processâbased ecohy-drological modeling (WaSSI model) on longâterm streamflow data, we explored whether vegetation damage caused by this hurricane resulted in an increase in streamflow two years after the extreme event. We found that monthly streamflow from the Chipola River watershed with an area of 2023 km2 did not change (<6%) appreciably during the first two years following the storm, arguably be-cause only a fraction of the gauged watershed lost substantial tree cover. However, spatially explicit hydrological modeling suggested that several subâwatersheds with the highest decreases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) significantly increased their monthly streamflow in 2019 by up to 22%. These modeled streamflow anomalies subsided by the second growing season when vegetation recovered. Overall, this study suggests that changes in vegetation cover after Hurricane Michael did not have lasting impacts on the hydrology of this watershed, and the hydrology of coastal watersheds may be more resilient to hurricane disturbances than previously thought.

"Impact of anthropogenic development on coastal ground-water hydrology in Southeastern Florida, 1900-2000","Renken, R.A.; Dixon, J.; Koehmstedt, J.; Lietz, A.C.; Ishman, S.; Marella, R.; Telis, P.; Rogers, J.; Memberg, S.","Southeastern Florida is an area that has been subject to widely conflicting anthropogenic stress to the Everglades and coastal ecosystems. This stress is a direct consequence of the 20th century economic competition for limited land and water resources needed to satisfy agricultural development and its expansion, its displacement by burgeoning urban development, and the accompanying growth of the limestone mining industry. The development of a highly controlled water-management system designed to reclaim land for urban and agricultural development has severely impacted the extent, character, and vitality of the historic Everglades and coastal ecosystems. An extensive conveyance system of canals, levees, impoundments, surface- water control structures, and numerous municipal well fields are used to sustain the present-day Everglades hydrologic system, prevent overland flow from moving eastward and flooding urban and agricultural areas, maintain water levels to prevent saltwater intrusion, and provide an adequate water supply. Extractive mining activities expanded considerably in the latter part of the 20th century, largely in response to urban construction needs. Much of the present-day urban-agricultural corridor of southeastern Florida lies within an area that is no more than 15 feet above NGVD 1929 and formerly characterized by freshwater marsh, upland, and saline coastal wetland ecosystems. Miami- Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties have experienced explosive population growth, increasing from less than 4,000 inhabitants in 1900 to more than 5 million in 2000. Ground-water use, the principal source of municipal supply, has increased from about 65 Mgal/d (million gallons per day) obtained from 3 well fields in 1930 to more than 770 Mgal/d obtained from 65 well fields in 1995. Water use for agricultural supply increased from 505 Mgal/d in 1953 to nearly 1,150 Mgal/d in 1988, but has since declined to 764 Mgal/d in 1995, partly as a result of displacement of the agricultural industry by urban growth. Present-day agricultural supplies are obtained largely from surface-water sources in Palm Beach County and ground-water sources in Miami-Dade County, whereas Broward County agricultural growers have been largely displaced. The construction of a complex canal drainage system and large well fields has substantially altered the surface- and ground-water hydrologic systems. The drainage system constructed between 1910 and 1928 mostly failed to transport flood flows, however, and exacerbated periods of low rainfall and drought by overdraining the surficial aquifer system. Following completion of the 1930s Hoover Dike levee system that was designed to reduce Lake Okeechobee flood flows, the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project initiated the restructure of the existing conveyance system in 1948 through canal expansion, construction of protective levees and control structures, and greater management of ground-water levels in the surficial aquifer system. Gated canal control structures discharge excess surface water during the wet season and remain closed during the dry season to induce recharge by canal seepage and well withdrawals. Management of surface water through canal systems has successfully maintained lower ground-water levels inland to curb urban and agricultural flooding, and has been used to increase ground-water levels near the coast to impede saltwater intrusion. Coastal discharge, however, appears to have declined, due in part to water being rerouted to secondary canals, and to induced recharge to the surficial aquifer system by large municipal withdrawals. Southeastern Florida is underlain by Holocene- to Tertiary-age karstic limestone deposits that form (in descending order): a highly prolific surficial aquifer system, a poorly permeable intermediate confining system, and a permeable Floridan aquifer system. Prior to construction of a complex drainage network, a widespread uppermost veneer of fresh wetland peat and muck deposits served to store water, maintained a higher water table (prolonging the Everglades hydroperiod), and ultimately helped to limit movement of the coastal saltwater interface. The highly permeable Biscayne aquifer, which is part of the surficial aquifer system, yields 1,000 to more than 7,000 gallons per minute to wells. By 2000, the Floridan aquifer system was used for aquifer storage and recovery and reverse osmosis at some sites in southern Florida, but primarily was used for wastewater injection purposes; the efficacy of such systems has been increasingly the subject of public scrutiny. Prior to construction of the drainage system, the ground-water table reflected Atlantic Coastal Ridge topography, and springs reportedly discharged as freshwater boils. Everglades surface waters discharged southward toward Florida Bay and in the transverse glade areas. The modern-day ground-water table reflects the effect of canal systems, levees, impoundments, and the drawdown effects of larger well fields. The saltwater interface forms a broad zone of diffusion, and its position is largely a function of lateral movement of seawater from the Atlantic Ocean, seepage from tidal canals, and upconing of relict seawater. Emplacement of conveyance and drainage canals, subsequent compaction and oxidation of inland peat and muck soils (which served previously to maintain higher water levels within the surficial aquifer system, including the Biscayne aquifer), and increased withdrawals from municipal supply wells collectively altered the natural balance between freshwater and saltwater considerably. Saltwater intrusion has been a concern in southeastern Florida since the early 1930s; its effects were most pronounced in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties during the 1940s and 1950s, respectively. Canal drainage appears to have had the most widespread impact on saltwater intrusion, lowering water levels in the surficial aquifer system and contributing to landward movement of the interface. Core sample paleontologic observations of salinity and the distribution of seagrass in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay suggest that the coastal marine ecosystem system during the 20th century has been impacted considerably by anthropogenic activities. Land use and water-management practices have increased nutrient loads and other pollutants and increased bay turbidity. Prior to 1900, the Biscayne Bay ecosystem was characterized by much lower marine salinities, including the extreme southern part of the bay, which contained waters that were nearly fresh. Consistent with the progressive inland saltwater intrusion into the surficial aquifer system and the Biscayne aquifer, the increase in salinity interpreted for surface- and groundwater resources in the early 1900s through the 1970s is the result of increased urban development and construction of a canal drainage system. Post-1940 water-management practices to control water discharge greatly affected the Biscayne Bay ecosystem by increasing the frequency, and particularly the magnitude of salinity fluctuations in the 1940s. Clearly, the changes in land use and water-management practices over the long term have had a profound effect on the ground-water hydrology of southeastern Florida.",2005,,US Geol. Surv.

The importance of pulsed physical events for sustainability of Louisiana coastal forested wetlands,"Day, J.W.; Conner, W.H.; Shaffer, G.P.","A number of freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River into Louisiana's coastal wetlands are currently in operation or in the planning stage. These diversions have multiple objectives including maintaining a desirable salinity gradient, restoring deteriorating wetlands, and enhancing fisheries. The extensive freshwater forested wetlands surrounding the western end of Lake Pontchartrain receive little or no sediment input and are currently deteriorating due to continuous flooding. Diverting nutrient-rich water through wetlands can lead to substantial nutrient removal and to enhanced accretion. The objective of this paper is to compare the impacts on freshwater wetland ecology, accretion, and water quality of several scenarios for diverting freshwater from the Mississippi River. Accretion will be increased so that the area will become progressively less flooded, enhancing productivity and seedling recruitment. With overland flow, about 73% of N and 48% of P will be retained in the wetland, while other alternatives are estimated to remove 0-33% of N and 0-40% of P. Productivity of the forested wetland will decrease by at least 20-50% over the next 50 years if nothing is done, but there would be a substantial increase in productivity if river water is diverted into the area. We recommend that a 45-55 m3/s diversion be placed in the southern portion of the swamps of Lake Maurepas and that the diversion be operated annually from winter to early spring. There are indications that a diversion in late summer and fall would be beneficial, as that is when salt pulses typically occur.",2006,,Hydrol. Manage. For. Wetlands - Proc. Int.

"Baldcypress and water tupelo responses to insect defoliation and nutrient augmentation in Maurepas Swamp, Louisiana, USA","Effler, R.S.; Goyer, R.A.; Lenhard, G.J.","Forested wetlands in Louisiana are hydrologically isolated from the Mississippi River, impacted by saltwater intrusion, and are sinking, resulting in more frequent flooding for longer periods. These problems are exacerbated in some areas by impoundment from man-made structures. Additionally, defoliation of the two dominant trees, baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.), frequently occur during spring. In Louisiana, the baldcypress leafroller, BCLR (Archips goyerana Kruse) and the forest tent caterpillar, FTC (Malacosoma disstria Hubner) annually defoliate an average of 120,000 ha of baldcypress-tupelo swamps. In combination, these factors have led to severely degraded forested wetlands with reduced basal area, dieback and tree mortality over extensive, formerly productive swamplands. Restoration plans call for reintroducing Mississippi River water by diversions, to increase sediment elevation, promote natural regeneration, and enhance primary and secondary productivity. Nutrient augmentation of baldcypress and water tupelo trees in Maurepas Swamps (similar to NO3- loading rates expected from 229 m3/s diversion) increased radial growth (cm2) of both species (especially baldcypress) in degraded forest stands. Nutrient augmentation also increased nitrogen in foliage (insect frass (feces), spring clipped leaves, and abscised leaf litter) for both tree species. Nitrogen content of canopy foliage and leaf litter was positively correlated with site health. These findings support hypotheses that swamps in southeastern Louisiana are nutrient limited, and existing trees can utilize, benefit, and act as nutrient sinks for nutrient-laden river water accompanying diversions. Defoliation of these swamp species, although not uniform among years, did not result in losses in radial growth, but increased overall litter deposition for baldcypress. An increase in nitrogen content in insect frass in response to nutrient augmentation indicates defoliator populations might increase as a result of nutrient influxes. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Spatiotemporal Surface-Groundwater Interaction Simulation in South Florida,"Chebud, Y.; Melesse, A.","South Florida ecosystem is dictated by a large wetland, karst hydrogeology and extended coastal boundary with the Atlantic Ocean. The risks related to the ecosystem include: disruption of groundwater flow as a result of frequent sinkhole formation; flooding in urban areas as a result of the shallow water table; saltwater intrusion from the ocean; and excessive nutrient load to surficial water bodies and subsequently eutrophication because of the intensive utilization of wetlands for nutrient removal. Attempts to understand eco-hydrological processes primarily focus on extensive monitoring and use of distributed hydrological models. However, the relatively flat nature of the region and also the extended coastal boundary with the ocean, makes watershed-based approaches less realistic. A regional spatiotemporal groundwater level modeling approach was attempted using a Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) method. The daily water levels of 13 monitoring well sites from major hydrogeologic regions and different land uses were used to conduct the DFA analysis, and six dynamic factors were identified using minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Further exploratory analysis to relate the dynamic factors with physically attributable explanatory variables has helped to identify five of the major factors that govern the groundwater dynamics in south Florida. Three of the factors were attributable to the Lake Kissimmee water level in the north, Caloosahatchee River water level in the west, and Hillsboro canal in the east. The other two factors identified were the regional averaged rainfall and soil moisture. The spatiotemporal simulation involved interpolation of the loadings of the dynamic factors using an inverse distance weighted method and convoluting with the dynamic factors. The result has shown a good fit with the maximum RMSE of 0. 12 m. Retrieval of rainfall, soil moisture, and surface water level from satellite imagery makes spatiotemporal modeling of the groundwater level achievable.

Ecological impacts of hurricane ivan on the gulf coast of Alabama: A remote sensing study,"Bianchette, T.A.; Liu, K.-B.; Lam, N.S.-N.; Kiage, L.M.","Hurricane Ivan made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a category 3 storm in 2004, causing a storm surge of > 3.0 m and massive tree mortality in the forest around the Shelby Lakes in Gulf State Park. We documented the ecological impacts of Hurricane Ivan by means of remote sensing techniques using Landsat 5 images, coupled with a ground survey of tree mortality and damage patterns. NDVI-based land cover classifications of pre- and post-Ivan images reveal that 44% of the forest in the study area was killed or heavily damaged by the storm. Ground survey data suggest that the belt delineated as dead or highly damaged vegetation is characterized by low elevations (< 3 m) and high tree mortality (50-100% dead trees); whereas forested areas occurring on higher grounds (> 3 m elevation) suffered lower (< 50%) tree mortality. The damage pattern strongly suggests that saltwater intrusion and storm surge flooding, rather than wind damage, was the main cause for massive tree mortality around the Shelby Lakes.

Effects include flooding, saltwater intrusion, and loss of wetland-based resources.

Aquifer salinization from storm overwash,"Anderson Jr., W.P.","Overwash processes are not only an agent of change to the morphology of barrier islands; they are also a source of instantaneous saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifers. Hatteras Island, North Carolina, USA is particularly susceptible to overwash processes because of its geography and the frequency with which tropical and extra-tropical storms strike the area. Hurricane Emily inundated the island in 1993 with saline water from Pamlico Sound. The floodwaters recharged the Buxton Woods Aquifer, raising salinity levels from approximately 40 mg/L prior to flooding to nearly 280 mg/L within several weeks of flooding. By 1997, chloride levels still had not returned to pre-storm levels. One-dimensional analytical solutions of the advection-dispersion equation are used to simulate chloride transport within the aquifer utilizing a pulse source implemented with linear superposition. These simulations are matched with chloride breakthrough curves. Initial simulations show that a pulse duration of five days provides the best fit to the data. Simulation of chloride breakthrough at two streamline locations demonstrates that higher gradients advect chloride further into the aquifer, causing higher chloride concentrations and increasing the duration of contamination. The Cape Hatteras region historically is susceptible to several hurricanes in a single season. In order to analyze the effect of multiple overwash events on water quality, predictive simulations show the effect of two overwash events separated by several time lags between storms. Simulations indicate that higher gradients and short time lags between overwash events result in chloride MCL violations that persist for more than four months.",2002,,J. Coast.

Response of a freshwater marsh plant community to increased salinity and increased water level,"McKee, K.L.; Mendelssohn, I.A.","Field and greenhouse experiments in which salinity and elevation were manipulated demonstrated that the response of freshwater marshes to saltwater intrusion may be variable and dependent upon a number of factors including: species composition; level, duration, and abruptness of exposure to saline water; flooding depth; a source of propagules of more salt-tolerant species. In the field, saltwater intrusion was simulated by transplanting swards of a freshwater marsh to a higher salinity area. The three dominant species, Panicum hemitomon Schultes, Leersia oryzoides (L.) Swartz, and Sagittaria lancifolia L., succumbed to the sudden increase in salinity to 15%. However, the denuded plots were rapidly invaded by more salt-tolerant species that were present in the higher salinity marsh. Although growth was reduced, Panicum hemitomon and Leersia oryzoides were relatively tolerant of salinities up to 9.4% for at least 1 month in the greenhouse. Sagittaria lancifolia was less tolerant of salinity increases and showed symptoms of tissue damage at 4.8%. A decrease in elevation, which resulted in an increase in mean water level and a more reduced soil environment, caused a significant decrease in live above-ground biomass and stem density in the experimental field plots.

WATER TABLE MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.,"Martin, James D.","Practices that provide optimum water use for crop production and maximum protection against depletion of organic soils are important.

Water table management is an important element to successful farming in the flatlands of Southern Florida. It is practiced on approximately 607,287 ha. The climate in this area is ideal for the production of specialty crops grown out of season for the rest of the country.

Asynchronous budbreak in Taxodium distichum L. Richard (baldcypress) as a mode of resistance against Archips goyerana Kruse (baldcypress leafroller),"Johnson, C.W.; Goyer, R.A.; Lenhard, G.J.","Coastal stands of Taxodium distichum L. Richard (baldcypress) in Louisiana, USA, are in decline because of saltwater intrusion, prolonged flooding, and periodic defoliation by an insect herbivore, Archips goyerana Kruse (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae; the baldcypress leafroller). The objective of this study was to examine the potential for the use of variation in budbreak among half-sibling families previously evaluated for salt tolerance as a means of resistance to defoliation. Four half-sibling families were categorized as either early (FA7, SG2) or late (SW2, VE2) leafing during budbreak. Laboratory bioassays in 2002 found that larvae fed on foliage collected on the same date encountered foliage from early-leafing half-sibling families of an advanced age that was significantly lower in N, P, K, and moisture content and significantly higher in digestion-inhibiting compounds (phenolics) than foliage from later leafing half-sibling families. Insect pupal weights and relative growth rates were significantly lower on early-leafing half-sibling families. In 2003, the early and late-leafing families were experimentally synchronized with larvae by collecting foliage from family groups in order of budbreak. Foliar N remained significantly higher and total phenolics significantly lower in the late-leafing families; however, moisture content, P, K, and insect pupal weights and relative growth rates did not differ significantly between early- and late-leafing half-sibling families. Intraspecific budbreak variation in baldcypress can affect insect growth and, potentially, baldcypress leafroller populations and should be explored further. The success of coastal baldcypress restoration programs in Louisiana might be improved by capitalizing on separate traits that reduce damage from herbivory and salinity.",2007,,J. Coast.

Securing water for the cities.,"Satterthwaite, D.","Many cities in developing countries have grown so much that they can no longer provide adequate, sustainable water. Over pumping in Dakar and Mexico City has forced those cities to obtain water from ever more distant sources. In Dakar, the result has been saltwater intrusion. Overpumping has caused Mexico City to sink, in some areas by as much as 9 m, resulting in serious damage to buildings and sewage and drainage pipes. Other cities facing similar water problems are coastal cities in Peru (e.g., Lima), La Rioja and Catamarca in Argentina, cities in Northern Mexico, and cities in dry areas of Africa. For some cities, the problem is not so much ever more distant water supplies but insufficient funds to expand supplies. Bangkok and Jakarta both face saltwater intrusion into their overdrawn aquifers. Even through agriculture is the dominant user of water in most countries, demand concentrated in a small area exhausts local and regional sources and pollutes rivers, lakes, and coasts with untreated human and industrial waste. Most cities in Africa and Asia do not have a sewerage system. Further, most cities do not have the drains to deal with storm water and external floodwater, causing frequent, seasonal flooding. The resulting stagnant water provides breeding grounds for insect vectors of diseases (e.g., malaria). The problems in most cities are a result of poor management, not lack of water. Reducing leaks in existing piped distribution systems from the usual 60% loss of water to leaks to 12% would increase the available water 2-fold.

Viscous finger wavelength degeneration in HeleâShaw Models,"Gupta, S.P.; Varnon, J.E.; Greenkorn, R.A.","The displacement of one fluid by another (miscible or immiscible) in porous media is an important phenomenon that occurs in groundwater movement arid oil reservoir engineering. Practical examples are water flooding, solvent flooding, saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, and coning. Experiments are presented on viscous fingering in HeleâShaw models. The use of HeleâShaw cells facilitates fundamental studies of the viscous effects. For an immiscible displacement the dispersive and the relative permeability phenomena are absent. This investigation covers the entire scope of finger development from the incipient fingers predicted by Chuoke's theory to a parallelâsided single finger. Results of several experiments run in a HeleâShaw cell with and without local heterogeneities show the wavelength degeneration to one finger for different flow conditions and the initial number of fingers. It was also found that the rate of growth develops almost immediately, well before the fingers are parallel sided. The mechanisms of wavelength generation and degeneration are discussed.

Policy,"Schmandt, J.","The preceding chapters document how climate change and climate variability will impact Texas: temperatures will rise, heat waves will occur more frequently, it will be drier west of the Interstate 35 corridor, severe weather will become more frequent, in-stream flows will fall, biodiversity will decline, and the sea level will rise. The exact timing of these changes and the speed at which they will occur remain uncertain. It is also unknown whether some of the predicted changes will occur gradually or suddenly after a tipping point has been reached. These findings echo what we presented in the first edition of this book, published in 1995. Results of more recent studies on climate change and Texas include: â¢ In 1997 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report, Climate Change and the States, that came to similar conclusions (EPA 1997). Its findings are summarized in Table 10.1. â¢ A national assessment published in 2000, ""The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,"" added important points: The summer heat index (which combines temperature and humidity) will increase significantly, heat stress for people and livestock will be more severe, soil moisture will decline as precipitation decreases and evaporation increases, reductions in water supply and quality will pose problems primarily for urban and poor populations, the coastal zone will suffer significant loss of property and damage to ecosystems as a result of coastal flooding and erosion, oil refineries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway will be at risk from more frequent and more intense storms, and the health of urban populations will be impaired by an increase in smog-forming gases from fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2000). â¢ Norwine and John (2007) concluded that South Texas by 2100 will be drier, hotter, and stormier. Barrier islands will have been lost, and saltwater intrusion will diminish water supplies. â¢ A recent study by the U.S. Global Change Research Program emphasizes the risk of more intense droughts: ""The consensus of most climate-model projections is for a reduction of cool-season precipitation across the U.S. Southwest and northwest Mexico"" (NOAA 2008). The likely impacts for Texas fall within the range of changes predicted for North America by Working Group 2 of the 2007 IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2007): IPCC assigns ""very high confidence"" to stress and damage from extreme weather and rising sea level, as well as infrastructure, health, and safety issues (Table 10.2). Taken together, the findings about the expected impacts of climate change on Texas have not changed fundamentally over the last decade and a half, but the evidence is now more extensive and detailed. In contrast, the context for policy development has changed substantially. There are several reasons for this. First, decision makers have fewer excuses to defer action because of scientific uncertainty. Key questions that were controversial two decades ago have been resolved: Yes, warming occurs not only at the earth's surface but also at higher altitudes. Yes, increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies global warming. Only the regional distribution of precipitation and the exact timing of predicted changes remain uncertain and require more study. Second, climate change is no longer a distant possibility but is occurring now. ""Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases."" This is in sharp contrast to our 1995 assumption that the impacts of climate change would be felt only by 2030. Third, the overwhelming majority of scientists are confident that observed and predicted changes in natural as well as social systems are caused by human actions. (These three statements are based on IPCC 2007.) As a result, the urgency to act on climate change has increased greatly since 1995. The 2007-2008 U.N. Human Development report starkly makes the point: ""Climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Centuryâ¯ Looking to the future, no country - however wealthy or powerful - will be immune to the impact of global warming"" (United Nations Development Program 2007). In this chapter I briefly review policy development in response to climate change at international, federal, state, and local levels and then discuss policy options for Texas. Several of the preceding chapters also discuss policy issues related to their subject matter. Here I focus on concrete policy measures that should be taken by state agencies and on development of a comprehensive state climate policy. (Table Presented).

The aim is to illustrate some of the wide range of information available from individual case studies and highlight common themes that are evident across multiple case-study locations. This is used to demonstrate linkages and sensitivities between the specific climate impacts of relevance for each case-study type (urban, rural and coastal) and the key climate hazards and biogeophysical and social vulnerabilities representing the underlying drivers and site conditions. For some impacts, there are clear, direct links with climate events, such as heat stress and flooding, while for others, such as energy supply and demand, the causal relationships are more indirect, via a cascade of climate, social and economic influences. Water availability and extreme temperatures are common drivers of current climate impacts across all case studies, including, for example, freshwater supply and heat stress for urban populations; irrigation capacity and growing season length for agricultural regions; and saltwater intrusion of aquifers and tourist visitor numbers at coastal locations. At some individual case-study locations, specific impacts, hazards and/or vulnerabilities are observed, such as peri-urban fires in Greater Athens, infrastructure vulnerability to coastal flooding in Alexandria, groundwater levels in Tel Hadya and vector-borne diseases in the Gulf of Oran. Throughout this chapter, evidence of current climate impacts, hazards and vulnerabilities from each of the case studies is detailed and assessed relative to other case studies. This provides a foundation for considering the wider perspective of the Mediterranean region as a whole, and for providing a context from which to assess consequences of future climate projections and consider suitable adaptation options.

Effects of salinity on baldcypress seedlings: Physiological responses and their relation to salinity tolerance,"Allen, J.A.; Chambers, J.L.; Pezeshki, S.R.","Growth and physiological responses of 15 open-pollinated families of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) subjected to flooding with saline water were evaluated in this study. Ten of the families were from coastal sites in Louisiana and Alabama, USA that have elevated levels of soil-water salinity. The other five families were from inland, freshwater sites in Louisiana. Seedlings from all families tolerated flooding with water of low (2 g l-1) salinity. Differences in biomass among families became most apparent at the highest salinity levels (6 and 8 g l-1). Overall, increasing salinity reduced leaf biomass more than root biomass, which in turn was reduced more than stem biomass. A subset of seedlings from the main greenhouse experiment was periodically placed indoors under artificial light, and measurements were made of gas exchange and leaf water potential. Also, tissue concentrations of Cl-, Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were determined at the end of the greenhouse experiment. Significant intraspecific variation was found for nearly all the physiological parameters evaluated, but only leaf concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were correlated with an index of family-level differences in salt tolerance.",1997,,Wetlands,17,2,310-320,,10.1007/BF03161419,,#16633,Allen 1997,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03161419,Louisiana,Alabama,USA,,

"Transient groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer: The effects of tides, the lunar cycle, and the beach profile","Abarca, E.; Karam, H.; Hemond, H.F.; Harvey, C.F.","Key Points The intertidal saline cell is not a permanent feature of a coastal aquifer The intertidal saline cell cycle is linked to the lunar cycle of tides The cell cycle modulates the fresh and salt groundwater fluxes to the ocean Detailed field measurements are combined with a numerical modeling to characterize the groundwater dynamics beneath the discharge zone at Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. Groundwater salinity values revealed a saline circulation cell that overlaid the discharging freshwater and grew and disappeared with the lunar cycle. The cell was initiated by a greater bay water infiltration during the new moon when high tides overtopped the mean high-tide mark, flooding the flatter beach berm and inundating a larger area of the beach. The dynamics of this cell were further characterized by a tracer test and by constructing a density-dependent flow model constrained to salinity and head data. The numerical model captured the growing and diminishing behavior of the circulation cell and provided the estimates of freshwater and saline water fluxes and travel times. Furthermore, the model enabled quantification of the relationship between the characteristics of the observed tidal cycle (maximum, minimum, and mean tidal elevations) and the different components of the groundwater circulation (freshwater discharge, intertidal saline cycling, and deep saline cycling). We found that (1) recharge to the intertidal saline cell is largely controlled by the high-tide elevation; (2) freshwater discharge is positively correlated to the low-tide elevation, whereas deep saline discharge from below the discharging freshwater is negatively correlated to the low-tide elevation. So, when the low-tide elevation is relatively high, more freshwater discharges and less deep saltwater discharges. In contrast when low tides are very low, less freshwater discharges and more deep salt water discharges; (3) offshore inflow of saline water is largely insensitive to tides and the lunar cycle.

"Geophysical characterization of seawater intrusion in Antigua, West Indies","Farrell, D.A.; Sandberg, S.K.; Barnes, H.; Browne, J.; Sutherland, A.; Humphrey, J.; Mayers, B.L.; Weller, J.","The Inter-American Agency for Cooperation and Development is currently funding a project focused on groundwater management in coastal karst environments in the Caribbean. The islands of Jamaica, Antigua, and Barbados are currently the primary regional participants in this project. Geophysical characterization of pilot sites on each of these islands is being used to provide input into conceptual groundwater flow models, which in turn will be used to support the development of sustainable groundwater management strategies for these coastal aquifers. Geophysical fieldwork at a pilot site located in the northeast portion of the island of Antigua took place in April 2004. Data from the survey support mapping the geology and hydrology of the region and locating the freshwater-seawater interface. Geophysical methods used in the fieldwork included time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) central-loop soundings, Schlumberger-array resistivity soundings, EM-31 terrain conductivity profiling, and multi-electrode resistivity profiling. In-field analysis of data collected at a regional scale led to a conceptual understanding of seawater intrusion into the study area. This conceptual understanding led to concentrated data collection efforts in specific areas. The first area surveyed in-depth to confirm our conceptual understanding of seawater intrusion at the site was Mercers Creek channel that runs from west of the Collins and Potworks reservoirs to Mercers Creek Bay located along the north coast of the island. TEM soundings, assembled into an eastwest profile across the channel, reveal a conductive region, thought to represent seawater migrating inland in response to the reduced freshwater head caused by pumping at the Collins well field. The second area surveyed in-depth was the Ayres Creek channel that runs by the Collins and Bristol well fields before draining into the extensive tidal flat at Nonsuch Bay located along the northeast coast of the island. This channel contains a secondary dam that captures outflow from the Potworks and Collins dams during periods of high rainfall and flooding, but is otherwise dry. This area was studied in detail using a high-density geophysical data collection strategy. Subsequent data interpretation led to the identification of a conductive zone that appears to be the result of seawater intrusion. The extent of the intrusion in the vicinity of the channel is controlled by the groundwater pumping at the Collins and Bristol well fields and storm surge/tidal fluctuations. This conceptual model has groundwater management implications that are being evaluated using groundwater flow models.",2005,,Proc. Symp. Appl. Geophyics Eng. Environ.

Characteristics of Seawater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers Due to Seawater Flooding: A Numerical Study,"Jeong, Y.H.; Lee, S.Y.; Lee, J.; Lee, T.K.; Lee, W.D.","In typical coastal aquifers, dense brine infiltrates under freshwater in a wedge form. However, during seawater flooding due to storm surges or tsunamis, dense brine infiltrates from the surface into the ground. In this study, to investigate the characteristics of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. we simulated seawater intrusion by seawater flooding using the Navier-Stokes solver based on the porous body model. The numerical analysis results showed that when the hydraulic gradient of the coastal aquifers was small, salt diffusion by seawater flooding occurred throughout the groundwater, and the infiltrated seawater remained in the freshwater layer for a long time. However, when the hydraulic gradient of the coastal aquifers was large, the salt damage by seawater flooding was relatively small, and the amount of infiltrated seawater that escaped into the sea through the groundwater flow increased. In other words, a larger hydraulic gradient of coastal aquifers leads to a lower salt diffusion in the groundwater by seawater flooding and a faster recovery. The results of this study will be useful for the preservation of coastal aquifers in the event of tsunamis and flooding. Â© 2021 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

Seawater intrusion in heterogeneous coastal aquifers under flooding events,"Mahmoodzadeh, D.; Karamouz, M.","Coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR) affects seawater intrusion (SWI) in aquifers. Under coastal flooding events, SWI from both sea boundary and land-surface is expected to increase. SWI in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics. In this study, the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on SWI is quantified in a two-dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer. Three indices including the seawater toe location (xtoe), the mixing volume (vmv) and the SWI volume (vswiv) are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater. A series of 50 log-normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the GCOSIM3D code. Then, numerical simulations of transient, saturated-unsaturated variable-density flow and solute transport, SUTRA, are performed in a stochastic Monte Carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity. During storm surge events, seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality. The results indicate that the storm surge has a short-term impact on fresh groundwater. The aquifer is significantly influenced by SLR as a long-term effect while it causes a larger xtoe in comparison with pre-flooding eventsâ conditions. Also, the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of SLR show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller xtoe which is more realistic. Comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects SWI status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events. It causes reduction in xtoe and vswiv as well as increase in vmv. This study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity, in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers.

"Vegetation Trends in a Restored Coastal Wetland at Prisoners Harbor, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park","Power, P.J.; Denn, M.; Wagner, J.; Martin, M.","Prisoners Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, California, formerly supported a 5-ha wetland and riparian system, the largest on the California Channel Islands. During the late 1800s ranchers filled in about half of the wetland area in order to support ranching activities. They also rerouted the stream channel to the canyon edge and built an earthen berm along its west bank, which disconnected the stream from its floodplain. The National Park Service developed a wetland and riparian restoration design for Prisoners Harbor based on topographic and hydrologic analyses and on vegetation community depth-to-water-table relationships developed from neighboring reference wetlands. In 2011 Channel Islands National Park and The Nature Conservancy restored 1.25 ha of coastal wetlands by removing artificial fill and the earthen berm. Postproject vegetation monitoring during 2012 to 2016 showed increased abundance of 3 of the 8 herbaceous planted wetland species and declines in target invasive species. Severe drought conditions during this window likely influenced vegetation abundance. Postrestoration hydrologic monitoring showed that the restored marsh met the federal wetland hydrology standard only twice: once in late 2011 before the drought began and then again in January-September 2017. An exceptionally large swell and high tide during winter 2015/16 resulted in saltwater flooding of the site; salinity returned to more typical values only slowly after this event. Expansion of wetland species, even during a historic drought and atypical seawater intrusion, suggests that this evidence-based approach to restoration design will result in functional coastal wetland habitat as more typical precipitation levels return. However, we emphasize the need for aggressive control of nonnative plants until native plant cover is well established. Â© Brigham Young University 2018.",2018,,West. North Am.

Influence of Coastal Flooding on Seawater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers,"Mahmoodzadeh, D.; Karamouz, M.","Coastal aquifers as vital fresh groundwater resources are subjected to coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR). Increasing the seawater intrusion volume (SWIV) from both seaward boundary and land-surface can be expected in coastal aquifers as a result of coastal flooding. In the present study, a numerical method using a saturated-unsaturated density-dependent flow and transport code, SUTRA, is employed to understand how such effects can change the groundwater quality of unconfined aquifers. Storm surge simulation shows that SWIV is increased during the coastal storm below the flooded land-surface. However, this increase is a short-Term event. Also, existence of topographic depression negligibly enhances the SWIV in comparison with that of no topographic depression. Unconfined aquifers are significantly influenced from SLR as a long-Term effect.

Effects of salinity and flooding on post-hurricane regeneration potential in coastal wetland vegetation,"Middleton, B.A.","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The nature of regeneration dynamics after hurricane flooding and salinity intrusion may play an important role in shaping coastal vegetation patterns. METHODS: The regeneration potentials of coastal species, types and gradients (wetland types from seaward to landward) were studied on the Delmarva Peninsula after Hurricane Sandy using seed bank assays to examine responses to various water regimes (unflooded and flooded to 8 cm) and salinity levels (0, 1, and 5 ppt). Seed bank responses to treatments were compared using a generalized linear models approach. Species relationships to treatment and geographical variables were explored using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. KEY RESULTS: Flooding and salinity treatments affected species richness even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). Maritime forest was especially intolerant of salinity intrusion so that species richness was much higher in unflooded and low salinity conditions, despite the proximity of maritime forest to salt-marsh along the coastal gradient. Other vegetation types were also affected, with potential regeneration of these species affected in various ways by flooding and salinity, suggesting relationships to post-hurricane environment and geographic position. CONCLUSIONS: Seed germination and subsequent seedling growth in coastal wetlands may in some cases be affected by salinity intrusion events even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). These results indicate that the potential is great for hurricanes to shift vegetation type in sensitive wetland types (e.g., maritime forest) if post-hurricane environments do not support the regeneration of extent vegetation.

Succession in wetlands,"Middleton, B.A.","                             Succession refers to the change in vegetation over time driven by disturbances and the maturation of plant species. In wetlands, these disturbances include water and salinity level changes along other factors that can alter vegetation. The historical view of succession (Clementsian) was that vegetation change represented the linear progression of through stages of vegetation toward a climax state. These stages were thought to be comprised of species that were interlocked with each other. These days the idea that succession is represented by the successive replacement of highly related sets of communities over time has been deemphasized, in favor of the idea that species in the community act more independently of one another (Gleasonian). An important example of this Gleasonian perspective model has been developed for prairie wetlands of North America by van der Valk. In this view, succession proceeds in a cyclic fashion, with flooding and drought driving changes in specific species, so that the indi- vidualistic species responses to water regime and other disturbances drive changes in the system (Environmental Sieve Model). The succession of many other world wetlands types is thought to occur in a similar way. These recent ideas of succession emphasize that species that are able to regenerate after disturbance via seed banks and propagules, and that the nature of post-distur- bance regeneration is the most important determinant of later succession (initial floristics). Notably, the idea that lakes and bogs represent an early state of succession, and that depressions fill in to become dry land (terrestrialization) has little evidence. With climate change, wetlands are likely to have altered successional trajectories, particularly as these ecosystems become exposed to different climatic temperatures, flooding/drought cycles, salinity intrusion and increased CO                             2                             .

Responses of estuarine circulation and salinity to the loss of intertidal flats - A modeling study,"Yang, Z.; Wang, T.","Intertidal flats in estuaries are coastal wetlands that provide critical marine habitats to support wide ranges of marine species. Over the last century many estuarine systems have experienced significant loss of intertidal flats due to anthropogenic impacts. This paper presents a modeling study conducted to investigate the responses of estuarine hydrodynamics to the loss of intertidal flats in Whidbey Basin of Puget Sound on the northwest coast of North America. Changes in salinity intrusion limits in the estuaries, salinity stratification, and circulation in intertidal flats and estuaries were evaluated by comparing model results under the existing baseline condition and the no-flat condition. Model results showed that loss of intertidal flats results in an increase in salinity intrusion, stronger mixing, and a phase shift in salinity and velocity fields in the bay front areas. Model results also indicated that loss of intertidal flats enhances two-layer circulation, especially the bottom water intrusion. Loss of intertidal flats increases the mean salinity but reduces the salinity range in the subtidal flats over a tidal cycle because of increased mixing. Salinity intrusion limits extend upstream in all three major rivers discharging into Whidbey Basin when no intertidal flats are present. Changes in salinity intrusion and estuarine circulation patterns due to loss of intertidal flats affect the nearshore habitat and water quality in estuaries and potentially increase risk of coastal hazards, such as storm surge and coastal flooding.

Ground and confined underground waters and their salt content,"Ravshanov, N.; Daliev, Sh.; Abdullaev, Z.; Khafizov, O.","A article developed a mathematical model for monitoring and predicting changes in groundwater level and salt concentration, as well as for representing the process of flooding, salinization and waterlogging in the design of hydraulic structures. A qualitative analysis of the research work on this issue is presented. Since the process is represented by a nonlinear differential equation, a numerical algorithm based on finite-difference schemes was developed to solve it. Mathematical models of the processes of geofiltration of salt migration have been improved and computational algorithms have been developed. A numerical algorithm has been developed for calculating the problem of changing the groundwater level, taking into account active porosity, flow rate in two-layer formations.

Frequent Storm Surges Affect the Groundwater of Coastal Ecosystems,"Nordio, G.; Frederiks, R.; Hingst, M.; Carr, J.; Kirwan, M.; Gedan, K.; Michael, H.; Fagherazzi, S.","Recent studies have focused on the effect of large tropical cyclones (hurricanes) on the shore, neglecting the role of less intense but more frequent events. Here we analyze the effect of the offshore tropical storm Melissa on groundwater data collected along the North America Atlantic coast. Our meta-analysis indicates that both groundwater level and specific conductivity significantly increased during Melissa, respectively reaching maximum values of 1.09Â m and 25.2Â mS/cm above pre-storm levels. Time to recover to pre-storm levels was 10 times greater for groundwater specific conductivity, with a median value of 20Â days, while groundwater level had a median recovery time of 2Â days. A frequency-magnitude analysis indicates that the percent of time with salinization is higher for Melissa than for energetic hurricanes. Given the high frequency of these events (return period of 1â2Â years), and the long time needed for groundwater conditions to return to normal levels, we conclude that increasingly frequent moderate storms will have a significant impact on the ecology of vegetated shorelines.

Effects of a soil ameliorant on the desalting of soda-salinized meadow soil under flooding condition,"Zhang, M.; Zhou, W.; Shi, L.; Wang, C.; Du, J.; Wu, Y.; Zhang, Y.","Understanding the relationship between the soil ameliorants and soda-salinized meadow soil was crucial for improving its effect on different depths of soil layers. The study investigated the effects of the soil ameliorants on desalting soda-salinized meadow soil under flooding condition, we conducted a simulated leaching soil column experiment in laboratory, six ameliorants application rates, 0.00, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, and 1.00 g to each soil column (cross-sectional area 0.0113 m2), equivalent to the 0.0, 8.9, 44.3, 88.5, 442.5, and 885.1 kg Â· hm2, defined as SO, SI, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively. Our results indicated that under flooding condition, compared to SO, the application of soil ameliorants treatments (S3, S4, and S5) substantially reduced soil bulk density and soil pH on different depths of soil layers (0â¼30 cm) by 3.88% to 8.87% and 2.36% to 8.05%, respectively, and substantially increased soil porosity by 3.82% to 9.38% (P<0.05) on different depth soil layer (0 â¼ 30 cm). The application of soil ameliorants treatments (S2, S3, S4, and S5) enhanced soil moisture infiltration of 20-40 cm soil layer, with an increase of 55.9% to 294.6% (P<0.05). The application of soil ameliorant reduced exchangeable sodium content with 0â¼10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layer (P<0.05), decreased by 4.84% to 56.5% (P<0.05), increased exchangeable sodium content of 20-30 cm and 30-40 cm soil layer by 1.09%-17.1%; S3, S4, and S5 reduced electrical conductivity of 0-10 cm soil layer by 49.0% to 60.4% (P<0.05), increased electrical conductivity of 20-40 cm soil layer by 3.68% to 19.8% (P<0.05); S2, S3, S4, and S5 reduced CO2-3content of 10-20 cm soil layer by 5.98% to 23.4% (P<0.05); S3, S4, and S5 reduced HCO-3content of 0-30 cm soil layer by 1.49%-18.0%; S2, S3, S4, and S5 substantially enhanced water stable aggregate â¸ 0.25 mm, with an increase of 16.4% to 161.7% (P<0.05); S3, S4, and S5 substantially increased mean weight diameter (MDW) by 5.78% to 161.7% (P<0.05). Based on comprehensive analysis of the effect of soil ameliorants on desalting soda-salinized meadow soil and the application rates of soil ameliorants, the optimum application rate for the specific soil salinization in this experiment was proposed as 0.1g (88.5 kg Â· hm2) with each soil column.

"Influence of flooding, salinization, and soil properties on degradation of chlorantraniliprole in california rice field soils","Redman, Z.C.; Parikh, S.J.; Hengel, M.J.; Tjeerdema, R.S.","Chlorantraniliprole (3-bromo-N-[4-chloro-2-methyl-6-(methylcarbamoyl)phenyl]-1-(3-chloro-2-pyridine-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide; CAP) was granted supplemental registration for use in rice cultivation in California through December, 2018. Previous work investigated the partitioning of CAP in California rice field soils; however, its degradation in soils under conditions relevant to California rice culture has not been investigated. The degradation of CAP in soils from two California rice fields was examined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with varying salinity via microcosm experiments. Results indicate that soil properties governing bioavailability may have a greater influence on degradation than flooding practices or field salinization over a typical growing season. Differences between native and autoclaved soils (t1/2 = 59.0-100.2 and 78.5-171.7 days) suggest that biological processes were primarily responsible for CAP degradation; however, future work should be done to confirm specific biotic processes as well as to elucidate abiotic processes, such as degradation via manganese oxides and formation of nonextractable residues, which may contribute to its dissipation.

Hydrological and geomorphological controls on the water balance components of a mangrove forest during the dry season in the pacific coast of Nicaragua,"Calderon, H.; Weeda, R.; Uhlenbrook, S.","Hydrological and geomorphological processes are key to mangrove forest growth and development. However, few mangrove hydrology studies exist in Central America. A 0.2 km2 mangrove forest on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua was investigated to determine the water balance dynamics during the dry season. The used multi-methods approach combined hydrology, hydrochemistry and geophysics. Precipitation is the main freshwater input. Beach ridges are the key geomorphologic features which allowed an increase in water storage of 351 m3d-1 during a 22 day period. Large precipitation events cause breaking of the beach ridges by excess water, suddenly emptying the system. Grey water and pit latrines from the nearby town influence shallow groundwater quality, but also provide extra nutrients for the mangrove forest. Groundwater chemistry is also affected by calcite dissolution and seawater. Refreshening and salinization processes are controlled by the general groundwater flow direction. Hydraulic and hydrochemical influence of seawater on coastal piezometers seems to be controlled by the elevation of the water table and the tidal amplitude. These conditions control forest subsistence during the dry season, which is essential for the mangrove forest to provide ecological and economic benefits such as protection against flooding, habitat for numerous species, and tourist attraction.

Short term effects of salinization on compound release from drained and restored coastalwetlands,"Liu, H.; Lennartz, B.","Over the past two decades, great efforts have been made to restore coastal wetlands through the removal of dikes, but challenges remain because the effects of flooding with saline water on water quality are unknown. We collected soil samples from two adjacent coastal fen peatlands, one drained and diked, the other open to the sea and rewetted, aiming at assessing the mobility and export of various compounds. Microcosm experiments with constant flow-through conditions were conducted to determine the effluent concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH4 +), and phosphate (PO4 3-) during saline-fresh water cycles. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to adjust salinity (saline water, NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1; fresh water, NaCl concentration of 0.008 mol L-1) and served as a tracer. A model analysis of the obtained chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) breakthrough curves indicated that peat soils have a dual porosity structure. Sodium was retarded in peat soils with a retardation factor of 1.4 Â± 0.2 due to adsorption. The leaching tests revealed that water salinity has a large impact on DOC, NH4 +, and PO4 3- release. The concentrations of DOC in the effluent decreased with increasing water salinity because the combination of high ionic strength (NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1) and low pH (3.5 to 4.5) caused a solubility reduction. On the contrary, saline water enhanced NH4 + release through cation exchange processes. The PO4 3- concentrations, however, decreased in the effluent with increasing water salinity. Overall, the decommissioning of dikes at coastal wetlands and the flooding of once drained and agriculturally used sites increase the risk that especially nitrogen may be leached at higher rates to the sea.

Quantification of Impacts and Ecosystem Services Loss in New Jersey Coastal Wetlands Due to Hurricane Sandy Storm Surge,"Hauser, S.; Meixler, M.S.; Laba, M.","The effects of Hurricane Sandy storm surge on wetland degradation and consequent loss of ecosystem services were estimated for coastal wetlands in New Jersey. Research in this field has qualitatively determined the effects of hurricanes on wetlands; however, there has been little quantification of wetland degradation and absolutely no assessment of impact to ecosystem services following a hurricane. Wetland degradation was mapped and quantified by comparing pre- and post-Sandy aerial photography from 2012. Loss of ecosystem services was estimated based on degree of wetland degradation. Our wetland degradation analysis found that the main mechanisms behind degradation were erosion, deposition and marsh salinization. Moderate flooding and marsh dieback were the most prevalent types of damage, and saline marshes and herbaceous wetlands were the most degraded wetland types. Severe degradation was most prevalent, occurring in 41.38Â % of the wetlands. In addition, we found that 51.05Â % of the degradation was long-term damage. In our ecosystem service loss analysis, we created a range of monetary values to show the distribution of damage. Monetary loss within New Jersey ranged up to $4.4 billion of the total $9.4 billion provided by wetlands (47Â %). Our wetland degradation quantification and ecosystem service loss analysis provide insight into the impacts from storm surge damage and offers a novel methodology for remediation and restoration efforts.

Water regimes of rice fields,"Nurjanov, S.","The article is a review work, periodic moistening - a layer of water is absent throughout the entire growing season of rice, optimum soil moisture is created through periodic irrigation. Mostly applied permanent and shortened flooding. The most promising is the water regime with shortened flooding. Depending on the method of sowing, debris from the rice field by grasslands and soil salinization, there are various options for this mode. Rice plant, like any other, imposes different requirements for water in different phases of the growing season. The best medium for rice in the period of germination and in the phase of emergence is a moist soil. To obtain seedlings on highly saline soils with a close level of saline groundwater, the most favorable is a small layer of water, which is periodically replaced.

Hurricane impacts on coastal wetlands: A half-century record of storm-generated features from Southern Louisiana,"Morton, R.A.; Barras, J.A.","Temporally and spatially repeated patterns of wetland erosion, deformation, and deposition are observed on remotely sensed images and in the field after hurricanes cross the coast of Louisiana. The diagnostic morphological wetland features are products of the coupling of high-velocity wind and storm-surge water and their interaction with the underlying, variably resistant, wetland vegetation and soils. Erosional signatures include construction of orthogonal-elongate ponds and amorphous ponds, pond expansion, plucked marsh, marsh denudation, and shoreline erosion. Post-storm gravity reflux of floodwater draining from the wetlands forms dendritic incisions around the pond margins and locally integrates drainage pathways forming braided channels. Depositional signatures include emplacement of broad zones of organic wrack on topographic highs and inorganic deposits of variable thicknesses and lateral extents in the form of shore-parallel sandy washover terraces and interior-marsh mud blankets. Deformational signatures primarily involve laterally compressed marsh and displaced marsh mats and balls. Prolonged water impoundment and marsh salinization also are common impacts associated with wetland flooding by extreme storms. Many of the wetland features become legacies that record prior storm impacts and locally influence subsequent storm-induced morphological changes. Wetland losses caused by hurricane impacts depend directly on impact duration, which is controlled by the diameter of hurricane-force winds, forward speed of the storm, and wetland distance over which the storm passes. Distinguishing between wetland losses caused by storm impacts and losses associated with long-term delta-plain processes is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of future conversion of land to open water.

"Water, climate, and social change in a fragile landscape","Hargrove, W.L.; Borrok, D.M.; Heyman, J.M.; Tweedie, C.M.; Ferregut, C.","We present here and in the companion papers an analysis of sustainability in the Middle Rio Grande region of the U.S.-Mexico border and propose an interdisciplinary research agenda focused on the coupled human and natural dimensions of water resources sustainability in the face of climate and social change in an international border region. Key threats to water sustainability in the Middle Rio Grande River region include: (1) increasing salinization of surface and ground water, (2) increasing water demand from a growing population in the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez area on top of an already high base demand from irrigated agriculture, (3) water quality impacts from agricultural, municipal, and industrial discharges to the river, (4) changing regional climate that portends increased frequency and intensity of droughts interspersed with more intensive rainfall and flooding events, and (5) disparate water planning and management systems between different states in the U.S. and between the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to these challenges, there is an increasing demand from a significant regional population who is (and has been historically) underserved in terms of access to affordable potable water. To address these challenges to water resources sustainability, we have focused on: (1) the determinants of resilience and transformability in an ecological/social setting on an international border and how they can be measured and predicted; and (2) the drivers of change . . . what are they (climate, social, etc.) and how are they impacting the coupled human and natural dimensions of water sustainability on the border? To tackle these challenges, we propose a research agenda based on a complex systems approach that focuses on the linkages and feedbacks of the natural, built/managed, and social dimensions of the surface and groundwater budget of the region. The approach that we propose incorporates elements of systems analysis, complexity science, and the use of modeling tools such as scenario planning and back-casting to link the quantitative with the qualitative. This approach is unique for our region, as are our bi-national focus and our conceptualization of ''water capital''. In particular, the concept of water capital provides the basis for a new interdisciplinary paradigm that integrates social, economic, and natural sectors within a systems framework in order to understand and characterize water resources sustainability. This proposed approach would not only provide a framework for water sustainability decision making for our bi-national region at the local, state, and federal levels, but could serve as a model for similar border regions and/or international rivers in arid and semi-arid regions in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.Â© 2013 Hargrove et al.",2013,,Ecosphere,4,2,,,10.1890/ES12-00269.1,,#17004,Hargrove 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1890/ES12-00269.1,U.S.,the El Paso,Mexico,,
Greenhouse soil salinity reclamation by leaching,"Blanco, F.F.; Folegatti, M.V.","Fertilizers overapplication and inadequate irrigation management in greenhouse crops have brought to soil salinization, resulting in crop yield reduction.

From the obtained results, we concluded that the application by drip was more efficient than flood in leaching the salts accumulated in the soil, and the relative water depth and coefficient K of 0.9 and 0.1 for drip and 1.3 and 0.2 for flooding, respectively, should be used.",2000,,ASAEAnnu.

Roles of saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and capillary rise in salinizing a non-flooding terrace on a flow-regulated desert river,"Glenn, E.P.; Morino, K.; Nagler, P.L.; Murray, R.S.; Pearlstein, S.; Hultine, K.R.","Tamarix spp. (saltcedar) secretes salts and has been considered to be a major factor contributing to the salinization of river terraces in western US riparian zones. However, salinization can also occur from the capillary rise of salts from the aquifer into the vadose zone. We investigated the roles of saltcedar and physical factors in salinizing the soil profile of a non-flooding terrace at sites on the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge on the Lower Colorado River, USA. We placed salt traps under and between saltcedar shrubs and estimated the annual deposition rate of salts from saltcedar. These were then compared to the quantities and distribution on of salts in the soil profile. Dense stands of saltcedar deposited 0.159kgm -2yr -1 of salts to the soil surface. If this rate was constant since seasonal flooding ceased in 1938 and all of the salts were retained in the soil profile, they could account for 11.4kgm -2 of salt, about 30% of total salts in the profile today. Eliminating saltcedar would not necessarily reduce salts, because vegetation reduces the upward migration of salts in bulk flow from the aquifer. The densest saltcedar stand had the lowest salt levels in the vadose zone in this study. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,,J.

"Knowledge, conservation and sustainable use of soil: Physic and morphological aspects","Pagliai, M.","The main aspects of environmental degradation can be ascribed to soil (erosion, soil compaction, soil crusting, deterioration of soil structure, flooding, losses of organic matter, salinisation, onsite and offsite damages, etc.) following the impact of human activities. Since agricultural conventional production systems have resulted in excessive erosion and soil degradation, there is need to control and fight such degradation. Scientific results have clearly showed that the agricultural management systems can play an important role in preventing soil degradation provide that appropriate management practices are adopted. Long-term field experiments in different types of soils have shown that alternative tillage systems, like minimum tillage, ripper subsoiling, etc., improve the soil structural quality. The continuous conventional tillage causes a decrease of soil organic matter content that is associated to a decrease of aggregate stability, leading, as a consequence, to the formation of surface crusts, with an increase of runoff and erosion risks. Other aspects of very dangerous soil degradation (erosion) in the hilly environments are represented by land levelling and scraping. After levelling, slopes being prepared for plantation (in particularly vineyard) are almost always characterised by the presence of large amounts of incoherent earth materials accumulated with scraper. In this vulnerable condition, a few summer storms can easily cause soil losses exceeding 500 Mg ha-1y -1. Moreover, the land levelling and the following soil loss causes drastic alteration of the landscape and loss of the cultural value of soil. Subsoil compaction is strongly under evaluated, even though the presence of a ploughpan at the lower limit of cultivation is largely widespread in the alluvial soils of the plains cultivated by monoculture and it is responsible of the frequent flooding of such plains in occasion of heavy rains concentrated in a short time (rainstorm), because the presence of this ploughpan strongly reduced drainage. Alternative tillage practices, like ripper subsoiling, are able to avoiding the formation of this compact layer. The soil conservation can be realised through a correct soil management and, therefore, it is essential to know this resource and to have pedological data bases of appropriate detail.",2009,,Ital. J.

Parametric Studies on Saltwater Intrusion into Coastal Aquifers for Anticipate Sea Level Rise,"Priyanka, BN; Mahesha, A","Saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers is a global issue, exacerbated by increasing demands for freshwater in coastal regions. This study investigates into the parametric analysis on saltwater intrusion in a conceptual, coastal, unconfined aquifer considering wide range of freshwater draft and anticipated sea level rise. The saltwater intrusion under various circumstances is simulated through parametric studies using MODFLOW, MT3DMS and SEAWAT. The MODFLOW is used to simulate the groundwater flow system under changing hydro-dynamics in coastal aquifer. To simulate solute transport MT3DMS and SEAWAT is used. The saltwater intrusion process has direct bearing on hydraulic conductivity and inversely related to porosity. It may also be noted that increase in recharge rate considered in the study does not have much influence on saltwater intrusion. Effect of freshwater draft at locations beyond half of the width of the aquifer considered has marginal effect and hence can be considered as safe zone for freshwater withdrawals. Due to the climate change effect, the anticipated rise in sea level of 0.88 m over a century is considered in the investigation. This causes increase in salinity intrusion by about 25%.

Evaluating the effects of and-use change and future climate change on vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater intrusion,"Bhattachan, A; Emanuel, RE; Ardon, M; Bernhardt, ES; Anderson, SM; Stillwagon, MG; Ury, EA; BenDor, TK; Wright, JP","The exposure of freshwater-dependent coastal ecosystems to saltwater is a present-day impact of climate and land-use changes in many coastal regions, with the potential to harm freshwater and terrestrial biota, alter biogeochemical cycles and reduce agricultural yields. Land-use activities associated with artificial drainage infrastructure (canals, ditches, and drains) could exacerbate saltwater exposure. However, studies assessing the effects of artificial drainage on the vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater exposure are lacking. We examined the extent to which artificial drainage infrastructure has altered the potential for saltwater intrusion in the coastal plain of eastern North Carolina. Regional spatial analyses demonstrate that artificial drainages not only lower the overall elevation in coastal landscapes, but they also alter the routing and concentration of hydrological flows. Together, these factors have the potential to increase the total proportion of the landscape vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, not only in areas adjacent to drainage infrastructure but also in places where no artificial drainages exist due to large scale effects of flow rerouting. Among all land cover types in eastern North Carolina, wetlands are most vulnerable to saltwater exposure.

Adaptation as a potential response to sea-level rise: a genetic basis for salinity tolerance in populations of a coastal marsh fish,"Purcell, KM; Hitch, AT; Klerks, PL; Leberg, PL","Relative sea-level rise is resulting in the intrusion of saline waters into marshes historically dominated by fresh water. Saltwater intrusions can potentially affect resident marsh species, especially when storm-related tidal surges cause rapid changes in salinity. We examined the role of historical salinity exposure on the survival of Gambusia affinis from two locations in coastal Louisiana. At each location, we sampled fish populations from fresh, intermediate and brackish marshes. Individuals were then exposed to a salinity of 25 parts per thousand and survival time was measured. We found that fish from brackish and intermediate marshes had an increased tolerance to salinity stress relative to fish from freshwater environments. We then tested the descendents of fish from the fresh and brackish marshes, reared for two generation in fresh water, to determine if there was a genetic basis for differential survival. We found that descendents of individuals from brackish marshes showed elevated survivals relative to the descendents of fish with no historical exposure to salinity. The most reasonable mechanism to account for the differences in survival relative to historical exposure is genetic adaptation, suggesting that natural selection may play a role in the responses of resident marsh fishes to future increases in salinity.",2008,,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,1,1,155-160,WOS:000262783400013,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00001.x,,#17208,Purcell 2008,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00001.x,Gambusia,Louisiana,,,
Exploration of the effects of storm surge on the extent of saltwater intrusion into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida (USA),"Xiao, H; Wang, DB; Medeiros, SC; Bilskie, MV; Hagen, SC; Hall, CR","Climate change such as altered frequency and intensity of storm surge from tropical cyclones can cause saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. In this study, a reference SEAWAT model and a diagnostic SEAWAT model are developed to simulate the temporal variation of surficial aquifer total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations after the occurrence of a storm surge for exploration of the effects of storm surge on the extent of saltwater intrusion into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida (USA). It is indicated from the simulation results that: (1) rapid infiltration and diffusion of overtopping saltwater resulting from storm surge could cause a significant and rapid increase of TDS concentrations in the surficial aquifer right after the occurrence of storm surge; (2) rapid infiltration of freshwater from rainfall could reduce surficial aquifer TDS concentrations beginning from the second year after the occurrence of storm surge in that the infiltrated rainwater could generate an effective hydraulic barrier to impede further inland migration of saltwater and provide a downgradient freshwater discharge for saltwater dilution and flushing counteracting the effects of storm surge on the extent of saltwater intrusion; and (3) infiltrated rainwater might take approximately eight years to dilute and flush the overwhelming majority of infiltrated saltwater back out to the surrounding waterbodies, i.e., the coastal lagoons and the Atlantic Ocean.

Assessment of the impact of sea-level rise on steady-state seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer,"Shi, WL; Lu, CH; Ye, Y; Wu, JC; Li, L; Luo, J","Previous studies on the impact of sea-level rise (SLR) on seawater intrusion (SWI) are mostly based on the assumption of a homogeneous coastal aquifer. In this study, we extend those studies by investigating SLR-induced SWI in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by Strack and Ausk (2015). We provide analytical solutions for steady-state SWI in confined and unconfined coastal aquifers, where both constant-head and constant-flux inland boundary conditions are considered. The analysis based on a three-layer aquifer indicates that in general aquifer stratification affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe. Specifically, for flux-controlled unconfined coastal systems, the toe response distance driven by SLR is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers. Using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity (derived based on the initial interface toe location before SLR) would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance, depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers. For flux-controlled confined layered coastal systems, by contrast, SLR can not cause variation of the steady-state interface toe location, which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers. The interface toe location in head-controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers. Moreover, the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux-controlled coastal system, as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux. The results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of SLR on SWI, which could provide a first-order assessment tool for relevant practitioners.",2018,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,563,,851-862,WOS:000441492700068,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.06.046,,#17267,Shi 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.06.046,,,,,
Impacts of inland boundary conditions on modeling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers due to sea-level rise,"Sun, DM; Niu, SX; Zang, YG","Inland boundary conditions have significant impacts on seawater intrusion (SWI) due to sea-level rise (SLR). This study investigated the impacts of three inland boundary conditions (flux-controlled (FC), head-controlled (HC) and general-head boundary (GHB)) on modeling SWI due to SLR in coastal aquifers. First, we used the TOUGH2/EOS7 software program to solve the standard Henry's problem and compared the results with those from the literatures. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the impacts of the three inland boundary conditions on SWI induced by SLR in confined coastal aquifers (standard Henry's problem) and unconfined coastal aquifers (Henry's problem extended to unconfined domains). The simulation results show that HC systems in both confined and unconfined coastal aquifers are remarkably vulnerable to the effects of SLR owing to the resulting decreased head difference, while FC systems are relatively insensitive to SLR because the equivalent freshwater head at the inland boundary can increase by a similar magnitude to the SLR. The GHB boundary is more realistic than the other two boundary conditions: the recharge decreases because of SLR depending on the aquifer properties and the head difference between the reference head and the equivalent freshwater head at the seaside boundary.",2017,,NATURAL HAZARDS,88,1,145-163,WOS:000405328100008,10.1007/s11069-017-2860-0,,#17285,Sun 2017,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-017-2860-0,,,,,
Functional and Compositional Responses of Periphyton Mats to Simulated Saltwater Intrusion in the Southern Everglades,"Mazzei, V; Gaiser, EE; Kominoski, JS; Wilson, BJ; Servais, S; Bauman, L; Davis, SE; Kelly, S; Sklar, FH; Rudnick, DT; Stachelek, J; Troxler, TG","Periphyton plays key ecological roles in karstic, freshwater wetlands and is extremely sensitive to environmental change making it a powerful tool to detect saltwater intrusion into these vulnerable and valuable ecosystems. We conducted field mesocosm experiments in the Florida Everglades, USA to test the effects of saltwater intrusion on periphyton metabolism, nutrient content, and diatom species composition, and how these responses differ between mats from a freshwater versus a brackish marsh. Pulsed saltwater intrusion was simulated by dosing treatment chambers monthly with a brine solution for 15months; control chambers were simultaneously dosed with site water. Periphyton from the freshwater marsh responded to a 1-ppt increase in surface water salinity with reduced productivity and decreased concentrations of total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These functional responses were accompanied by significant shifts in periphytic diatom assemblages. Periphyton mats at the brackish marsh were more functionally resilient to the saltwater treatment (similar to 2ppt above ambient), but nonetheless experienced significant shifts in diatom composition. These findings suggest that freshwater periphyton is negatively affected by small, short-term increases in salinity and that periphytic diatom assemblages, particularly at the brackish marsh, are a better metric of salinity increases compared with periphyton functional metrics due to functional redundancy. This research provides new and valuable information regarding periphyton dynamics in response to changing water sources in the southern Everglades that will allow us to extend the use of periphyton, and their diatom assemblages, as tools for environmental assessments related to saltwater intrusion.",2018,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,41,7,2105-2119,WOS:000445240600018,10.1007/s12237-018-0415-6,,#17292,Mazzei 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-0415-6,USA,,,,
Effect of Sea-Level Rise on Salt Water Intrusion near a Coastal Well Field in Southeastern Florida,"Langevin, CD; Zygnerski, M","A variable-density groundwater flow and dispersive solute transport model was developed for the shallow coastal aquifer system near a municipal supply well field in southeastern Florida. The model was calibrated for a 105-year period (1900 to 2005). An analysis with the model suggests that well-field withdrawals were the dominant cause of salt water intrusion near the well field, and that historical sea-level rise, which is similar to lower-bound projections of future sea-level rise, exacerbated the extent of salt water intrusion. Average 2005 hydrologic conditions were used for 100-year sensitivity simulations aimed at quantifying the effect of projected rises in sea level on fresh coastal groundwater resources near the well field. Use of average 2005 hydrologic conditions and a constant sea level result in total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of the well field exceeding drinking water standards after 70 years. When sea-level rise is included in the simulations, drinking water standards are exceeded 10 to 21 years earlier, depending on the specified rate of sea-level rise.",2013,,GROUND WATER,51,5,781-803,WOS:000323889900020,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.01008.x,,#17325,Langevin 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.01008.x,Florida,,,,
Climate Change Projected Effects on Coastal Foundation Communities of the Greater Everglades Using a 2060 Scenario: Need for a New Management Paradigm,"Koch, MS; Coronado, C; Miller, MW; Rudnick, DT; Stabenau, E; Halley, RB; Sklar, FH","Rising sea levels and temperature will be dominant drivers of coastal Everglades' foundation communities (i.e., mangrove forests, seagrass/macroalgae, and coral reefs) by 2060 based on a climate change scenario of +1.5 A degrees C temperature, +1.5 foot (46 cm) in sea level, +/- 10 % in precipitation and 490 ppm CO2. Current mangrove forest soil elevation change in South Florida ranges from 0.9 to 2.5 mm year(-1) and would have to increase twofold to fourfold in order to accommodate a 2060 sea level rise rate. No evidence is available to indicate that coastal mangroves from South Florida and the wider Caribbean can keep pace with a rapid rate of sea level rise. Thus, particles and nutrients from destabilized coastlines could be mobilized and impact benthic habitats of southern Florida. Uncertainties in regional geomorphology and coastal current changes under higher sea levels make this prediction tentative without further research. The 2060 higher temperature scenario would compromise Florida's coral reefs that are already degraded. We suggest that a new paradigm is needed for resource management under climate change that manages coastlines for resilience to marine transgression and promotes active ecosystem management. In the case of the Everglades, greater freshwater flows could maximize mangrove peat accumulation, stabilize coastlines, and limit saltwater intrusion, while specific coral species may require propagation. Further, we suggest that regional climate drivers and oceanographic processes be incorporated into Everglades and South Florida management plans, as they are likely to impact coastal ecosystems, interior freshwater wetlands and urban coastlines over the next few decades.",2015,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,55,4,857-875,WOS:000351838300009,10.1007/s00267-014-0375-y,,#17336,Koch 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0375-y,Florida,,,,
The impact of aquifer stratification on saltwater intrusion characteristics. Comprehensive laboratory and numerical study,"Etsias, G; Hamill, GA; Aguila, JF; Benner, EM; McDonnell, MC; Ahmed, AA; Flynn, R","Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were utilized in this study to assess the impact of aquifer stratification on saltwater intrusion. Three homogeneous and six layered aquifers were investigated. Image processing algorithms facilitated the precise calculation of saltwater wedge toe length, width of the mixing zone, and angle of intrusion. It was concluded that the length of intrusion in stratified aquifers is predominantly a function of permeability contrast, total aquifer transmissivity and the number of heterogeneous layers, being positively correlated to all three. When a lower permeability layer overlays or underlays more permeable zones its mixing zone widens, while it becomes thinner for the higher permeability strata. The change in the width of the mixing zone (WMZ) is positively correlated to permeability contrast, while it applies to all strata irrespectively of their relative vertical position in the aquifer. Variations in the applied hydraulic head causes the transient widening of WMZ. These peak WMZ values are larger during saltwater retreat and are negatively correlated to the layer's permeability and distance from the aquifer's bottom. Moreover, steeper angles of intrusion are observed in cases where low permeability layers overlay more permeable strata, and milder ones in the inverse aquifer setups. The presence of a low permeability upper layer results in the confinement of the saltwater wedge in the lower part of the stratified aquifer. This occurs until a critical hydraulic head difference is applied to the system. This hydraulic gradient value was found to be a function of layer width and permeability contrast alike.",2021,,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,35,4,,WOS:000645220700034,10.1002/hyp.14120,,#17338,Etsias 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14120,,,,,
Prospective scenarios of the saltwater intrusion in an estuary under climate change context using Bayesian neural networks,"Zhou, XD; Yang, T; Shi, PF; Yu, ZB; Wang, XY; Li, ZY","In recent decades, saltwater intrusion over some low-lying coastal regions was deteriorated by rising sea-level and decreasing streamflow in the context of climate change. Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.",2017,,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,31,4,981-991,WOS:000399692500010,10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7,,#17346,Zhou 2017,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7,,,,,
Interactive effects of hydrology and salinity on oligohaline plant species productivity: Implications of relative sea-level rise,"Spalding, EA; Hester, MW","Sea-level rise is anticipated to alter hydrologic and salinity regimes of coastal wetlands. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine species-level responses to 12 sea-level rise scenarios. Both hydrologic regime (-10, +5, and +20 cm flooding depth) and salinity level (fresh, 2%o, 4%o, and 6%o) were interactively manipulated. Within these various sea-level rise scenarios, we sought to determine the effects of hydrologic regime, salinity level, and the interaction of these two stresses on the productivity of Panicum hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Spartina patens, which are dominant macrophytes of fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh types, respectively, in coastal Louisiana and the southeastern coastal plain. We found that altered hydrologic regimes and increased salinity levels differentially affected edaphic conditions and species-level productivity. Increases in flooding depth were most detrimental to S. patens. Salinity levels greater than 4%o resulted in mortality of P. hemitomon, and salinity levels of 6%o resulted in reduced growth and eventual death of S. lancifolia. The effects of elevated salinity levels on P. hemitomon and S. lancifolia were exacerbated when coupled with increased flooding levels. Although soil organic matter was shown to increase in all vegetative conditions, increases were dependent upon the productivity of the species under the different hydrologic regimes and salinity levels with P. hemitomon displaying tremendous potential to increase soil organic matter under fresh conditions, especially when coupled with moderate flooding. The results of this study indicate that as plant communities are subjected to long-term changes in hydrology and salinity levels, community productivity and sustainability ultimately will be determined by species-level tolerances in conjunction with species interactions.",2007,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,30,2,214-225,WOS:000247075600002,10.1007/BF02700165,,#17349,Spalding 2007,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02700165,Louisiana,,,,
Assessing the Effects of Irrigation Water Salinity on Two Ornamental Crops by Remote Spectral Imaging,"Yu, XY; Her, YG; Chang, AJ; Song, JH; Campoverde, EV; Schaffer, B","Salinity is one of the most common and critical environmental factors that limit plant growth and reduce crop yield. The aquifers, the primary sources of irrigation water, of south Florida are shallow and highly permeable, which makes agriculture vulnerable to projected sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. This study evaluated the growth responses of two ornamental nursery crops to the different salinity levels of irrigation water to help develop saltwater intrusion mitigation plans for the improved sustainability of the horticultural industry in south Florida. Two nursery crops, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Mandevilla splendens, were treated with irrigation water that had seven different salinity levels from 0.5 (control) to 10.0 dS/m in the experiment. Crop height was measured weekly, and growth was monitored daily using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values derived from multispectral images collected using affordable sensors. The results show that the growth of H. rosa-sinensis and M. splendens was significantly inhibited when the salinity concentrations of irrigation water increased to 7.0 and 4.0 dS/m, for each crop, respectively. No significant differences were found between the NDVI values and plant growth variables of both H. rosa-sinensis and M. splendens treated with the different irrigation water salinity levels less than 2.0 dS/m. This study identified the salinity levels that could reduce the growth of the two nursery crops and demonstrated that the current level of irrigation water salinity (0.5 dS/m) would not have significant adverse effects on the growth of these crops in south Florida.",2021,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,11,2,,WOS:000621982300001,10.3390/agronomy11020375,,#17358,Yu 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11020375,Florida,,,,
Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization on Groundwater Resources in a Barrier Island,"Chang, SW; Nemec, K; Kalin, L; Clement, TP","Coastal freshwater aquifers are highly vulnerable to climate change and other anthropogenic environmental impacts. Therefore, managing coastal freshwater for future use requires critical planning. This is especially true for small barrier islands where, in most cases, groundwater could be the only freshwater resource. In this study, the combined effects of climate change, land-use changes, and increased groundwater pumping on freshwater resources of a barrier island were studied. A case study was completed using the field data available for Dauphin Island, a small barrier island located in Alabama, U.S., and by using the simulation data generated from multiple water-resource-management models. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulations provided recharge estimates under various future land use/land cover and climate-change scenarios. Downscaled global circulation model provided precipitation and temperature patterns for the period 2011-2030. The recharge estimates from SWAT were then used as input in a numerical groundwater model to evaluate saltwater-intrusion effects and forecast the changes in freshwater storage within the island aquifer system. Various groundwater-management scenarios were simulated using the MODFLOW-family computer code SEAWAT to assess the sensitivity of the groundwater system to increased pumping rates and decreased recharge due to climate change and/or future developments. SEAWAT was used to predict the lateral saltwater-intrusion effects and its impacts on groundwater quality and freshwater volume. The simulation results show that the saltwater wedge would advance laterally under all future climate-change scenarios. These results indicate that the shallow unconfined aquifer might not be able to sustain any significant future population growth, especially under adverse climate-change conditions. Analysis of changes in the volume of freshwater lens provided a broader understanding of the coupled effects of climatic and anthropogenic changes on freshwater storage and this information can be used to better manage Dauphin Island's unconfined groundwater system.

"A risk-based groundwater modeling framework in coastal aquifers: a case study on Long Island, New York, USA","Karamouz, M; Mahmoodzadeh, D; Essink, GHPO","A methodology is proposed to define indices for quantifying risks under the threat of reducing in groundwater levels, the existence of saltwater intrusion (SWI), and an increasing nitrate contamination load in submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The proposed methodology considers coastal regions under geological heterogeneity and it is tested on a groundwater system in Nassau County of Long Island, New York (USA). The numerical model is constructed with the SEAWAT code. The parameter uncertainty of this model is evaluated by coupling the Latin hypercube sampling method (as a sampling algorithm) and Monte Carlo simulation to consider the uncertainty in both hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate. The indices are presented in spatial maps that classify areas of risk to potential threats. The results show that two of the water districts have a high risk under conditions of decreasing groundwater level. Salinity occurs in the southern and southwestern parts of the Nassau County aquifer and a considerable area of high risk of SWI is identified. Furthermore, the average SGD rate with the associated fluxes of nitrate is estimated as 81.4 million m(3)/year (average 0.8 tons of nitrate through SGD per year), which can adversely affect the quality of life in the local coastal ecosystems.

Responses of Tidal Freshwater and Brackish Marsh Macrophytes to Pulses of Saline Water Simulating Sea Level Rise and Reduced Discharge,"Li, F; Pennings, SC","Coastal low-salinity marshes are increasingly experiencing periodic to extended periods of elevated salinities due to the combined effects of sea level rise and altered hydrological and climatic conditions. However, we lack the ability to predict detailed vegetation responses, especially for saline pulses that are more realistic in nature than permanent saline presses. In this study, we exposed common freshwater and brackish plants to different durations (1-31days per month for 3months) of saline water (salinity of 5). We found that Zizaniopsis miliacea was more tolerant to salinity than the other two freshwater species, Polygonum hydropiperoides and Pontederia cordata. We also found that Zizaniopsis miliacea belowground and total biomass appeared to increase with salinity pulses up to 16days in length, although this relationship was quite variable. Brackish plants, Spartina cynosuroides, Schoenoplectus americanus and Juncus roemerianus, were unaffected by the experimental treatments. Our experiment did not evaluate how competitive interactions would further affect responses to salinity but our results suggest the hypothesis that short pulses of saline water will increase the cover of Zizaniopsis miliacea and decrease the cover of Polygonum hydropiperoides and Pontederia cordata in tidal freshwater marshes, thereby reducing diversity without necessarily affecting total plant biomass.",2018,,WETLANDS,38,5,885-891,WOS:000450305300003,10.1007/s13157-018-1037-2,,#17379,Li 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-018-1037-2,,,,,
Testing the interactive effects of flooding and salinity on tidal marsh plant productivity,"Buffington, KJ; Goodman, AC; Freeman, CM; Thorne, KM","Tidal wetlands support plant communities that facilitate carbon storage, accrete soil, and provide habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change.

Trees from estuarine reaches heavily intruded by saltwater flooding contained larger concentrations of chloride, bromide, and sodium than did trees from less intruded reaches. At three intruded sites, trees nearest open water contained larger concentrations of these elements within outermost sapwood rings than did trees farther from open water and presumably flooded less often. Chloride was translocated from outer to inner sapwood rings of saltwater-intruded trees, resulting in larger concentrations within heartwood than within the inner sapwood. Chloride concentrations along the heartwood radius were used to estimate the position of the heartwood-sapwood interface during the beginning stages of intrusion, thus permitting historical estimates of the local onset of intrusion.

"PEAT COLLAPSE, PENDING AND WETLAND LOSS IN A RAPIDLY SUBMERGING COASTAL MARSH","DELAUNE, RD; NYMAN, JA; PATRICK, WH","Conversion of coastal marshes to inland open water is often associated with plant stresses such as saltwater intrusion into non-saline marshes and soil waterlogging, but the physical processes that initiate pond formation are not clear. We hypothesized that marsh elevation decreased rapidly following plant mortality because of structural collapse of the living root network. We monitored the elevation of 20 marsh hummocks between April 1990 and April 1992. Near total plant mortality occurred within 1 year and was attributed to excessive flooding. Hummock elevation decreased almost 15 cm within 2 years but elevation of adjacent ponds showed no trend. Plant stubble was still rooted in place on the submerged hummocks, and even slight evidence of surface erosion was not noted until the end of the study. The Cs-137 inventory in soil collected before and after the study also indicated that pest collapse rather than erosion caused the elevation decrease. Thus, pest collapse may initiate interior marsh ponds that subsequently spread via erosion and may partly explain why some marshes experiencing plant mortality convert to open water rather than re-vegetate. Feat collapse appeared to be the primary mechanism of marsh loss in this Louisiana hotspot.",1994,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,10,4,1021-1030,WOS:A1994PJ19000018,,,#17414,DELAUNE 1994,,,https://doi.org/nan,Louisiana,,,,

In this study, we simultaneously manipulated these three factors under controlled greenhouse conditions. This three-year study consisted of an experiment that included equal amounts of each of the three species of Sagittaria planted approximately 15 cm apart in 200 liter mesocosm vessels. Dead aboveground biomass was harvested regularly and above- and belowground biomass was harvested at the end of the study. All three species began with relatively high turnover across salinities. While S. latifolia and S. platyphylla only grew well in the freshwater treatments, S. lancifolia grew in all three salinity levels (0, 3, and 6 ppt) and showed decline in the 6 ppt treatment, but not until the third year. Both S. latifolia and S. platyphylla produced less belowground biomass than aboveground biomass while S. lancifolia produced much more belowground biomass in comparison to aboveground biomass. These results suggest that the pattern of replacement of S. latifolia and S. platyphylla by S. lancifolia in coastal Louisiana may be a result of locally increased salinities. Because Sagittaria lancifolia produces massive tubers and rhizomes (belowground biomass) and is somewhat flood- and salt-tolerant, it may be a good candidate for use in restoration of freshwater marshes that are susceptible to saltwater intrusion.",2005,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,21,1,167-174,WOS:000226987500013,10.2112/02110.1,,#17419,Martin 2005,,,https://doi.org/10.2112/02110.1,Louisiana,,,,
Effects of diversity and coalescence of species assemblages on ecosystem function at the margins of an environmental shift,"Werba, JA; Stucy, AL; Peralta, AL; McCoy, MW","Sea level rise is mixing formerly isolated freshwater communities with saltwater communities. The structure of these new aquatic communities is jointly controlled by pre- and post-colonization processes. Similarly, since salinity is a strong abiotic determinant of post-colonization survival in coastal systems, changes in salinity will likely impact community composition. In this study, we examine how a strong abiotic gradient affects the diversity and structure of bacterial and zooplankton communities and associated ecosystem functions (decomposition and carbon mineralization). We ran a six week dispersal experiment using mesocosm ponds with four distinct salinity profiles (0, 5, 9, and 13 psu). We find that salinity is the primary driver of both bacterial and zooplankton community composition. We find evidence that as bacterial richness increases so does the amount of decomposition. A phenomenological model suggests carbon mineralization may decrease at mid-salinities; this warrants future work into possible mechanisms for this apparent loss of function. Understanding how salinization changes community structure and ecosystem function maybe paramount for managing and conserving coastal plain ecosystems where salinity is increasing due to sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, storm surges, and drought.",2020,,PEERJ,8,,,WOS:000518532000004,10.7717/peerj.8608,,#17421,Werba 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8608,,,,,
Trends in vegetation and height of the topographic surface in a tidal freshwater swamp experiencing rooting zone saltwater intrusion,"Middleton, BA; David, JL","A decrease in the ground surface height of coastal wetlands is of worldwide concern because of its relationship to peat loss, coastal carbon, and biodiversity in freshwater wetlands. We asked if it is possible to determine in-dicators of impending transitions of freshwater swamps to other coastal types by examining long-term changes in the environment and vegetation. In a tidal Taxodium distichum swamp in Hickory Point State Forest, Maryland, the topographic surface height (ground surface height) decreased by as much as 25.6 +/- 2.2 to 50.8 +/- 3.8 cm at two Surface Elevation Tables from 2015 to 2021 following salinity intrusion events related to hurricanes and offshore storms (e.g., Hurricane Melissa). In 2019, rooting zone salinity exceeded 5 ppt for >24.9 % of the time, with a maximum salinity level of 12.5 ppt. Tree growth of T. distichum trees declined and 60 % of these trees died along a 4 m wide x 125 m transect in 2014-2016. Root biomass and ground surface height decreased roughly in conjunction with a salinity pulse in the rooting zone during Hurricane Melissa in 2019. Saplings survived but T. distichum seedlings were uncommon and did not survive in the study area. Typha x glauca increased in cover (0.2 to 5.6 % cover plot-1) from 2014 to 2016 so a vegetation shift toward T. x glauca was apparent by 2021. This work captures a multi-year trend of decreasing ground surface height, tree growth and health, and fresh-water status in the rooting zone that may be an indicator of impending vegetation transition.",2022,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,145,,,WOS:000886218900001,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109637,,#17426,Middleton 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109637,Taxodium,Maryland,,,
Effects of salinity and water level on coastal marshes: an experimental test of disturbance as a catalyst for vegetation change,"Baldwin, AH; Mendelssohn, IA","Wetlands in many coastal areas are threatened by sea level rise. Higher sea level will increase the frequency and duration of inundation in coastal areas and, in some systems, result in higher salinity as well. While the effects of salinity and water level on coastal marsh vegetation have been widely investigated, the role of disturbance in causing shifts in vegetation due to changes in salinity or water level has received little attention. We examined interactions of disturbance (clipping of aboveground vegetation) with salinity and water level treatments in a factorial arrangement using oligohaline marsh mesocosms. The mesocosms all contained soil and vegetation from two adjoining plant communities, one dominated by Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. and the other by Sagittaria lancifolia L. We assessed vegetation responses quarterly for 1 year and related responses to soil redox potential (E-h). sulfide concentration, salinity, and pH. We found that salinity and water level had significant effects on species richness only following disturbance and that similar patterns occurred for aboveground biomass of dominant and subdominant species. Following disturbance, aboveground biomass of Sagittaria lancifolia was significantly reduced by salinity but not by flooding (due to a capacity for seed germination under flooded conditions and rapid vegetative growth following disturbance), while the more salt-tolerant Spartina patens was eliminated by flooding but not affected by salinity. Disturbance led to almost complete eradication of vegetation under flooded, saline conditions. In the absence of disturbance, Sagittaria lancifolia biomass increased while Spartina patens was not affected in response to flooding, and neither species was significantly affected by salinity. Responses of vegetation corresponded with lower E-h in flooded and saline treatments and higher sulfide concentration in saline treatments. Our results suggest that disturbance is an important component of vegetation change in response to rising sea level, catalyzing rapid shifts in vegetation structure or accelerating wetland loss.

In situ measurements of wind-driven salt fluxes through constructed channels in a coastal wetland ecosystem,"Manda, AK; Reyes, E; Pitt, JM","A suite of instruments was deployed in a coastal wetland ecosystem in the Albemarle estuarine system, North Carolina (USA), to characterize wind-driven transport of saltwater through a constructed (man-made) channel. Flow velocity, electrical conductivity, and stage were measured in a representative channel over a 2-month period from May to July 2014, during which 4 wind tides were observed. Collected data show that thousands of metric tons of salt were advected through the channel into coastal wetlands during each event, which lasted up to 4days. The results reveal that as much as 36% of advected salts accumulated in the wetlands, suggesting that the cumulative effects of these events on the health of coastal wetlands in the Albemarle system may be substantial due to the abundance of constructed channels and the frequency of wind-driven tidal events. This study is the first to quantify wind-driven salt fluxes through constructed channels in coastal wetland settings.",2018,,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,32,5,636-643,WOS:000426510600004,10.1002/hyp.11445,,#17439,Manda 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11445,North Carolina,USA,Albemarle,,
"Mechanisms, configuration typology, and vulnerability of pumping-induced seawater intrusion in heterogeneous aquifers","Yu, X; Michael, HA","Coastal aquifers are vulnerable to seawater intrusion due to excessive groundwater pumping. Most research on salinization vulnerability considers homogeneous aquifers, forming the basis of management guidance. However, geologic structure can be highly heterogeneous, with preferential flow paths and low-permeability barriers that complicate flow and salt transport processes under pumping conditions. Here we use a series of variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport models with geostatistical representations of heterogeneity to illustrate characteristics of vulnerability in heterogeneous and homogeneous aquifers. Simulations showed that in homogeneous aquifers, salinization patterns were simple and related only to the hydraulic properties. In heterogeneous aquifers, salinization rates and patterns were much more complicated, and related to pumping location and depth, aquifer geometry, and geologic connections between pumping location, landward boundaries, and saline groundwater. An intrusion configuration typology approach was developed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers. The configuration approach was applied to heterogeneous aquifers of low, medium, and high geologic continuity, and vulnerability was assessed. The probability-based assessment was able to characterize the impact of pumping locations and rates in heterogeneous aquifers, considering different types of intrusion. The results showed that groundwater vulnerability to salinization was sensitive to pumping distance to the coastline for low-continuity aquifers and to pumping depth for high-continuity aquifers. The analysis provides new insights into the relationship between land-sea geologic connections and seawater intrusion vulnerability. The configuration approach plus probability-based assessment can be a starting point for large-scale aquifer characterization and more sophisticated groundwater management, including vulnerability assessment and optimization of pumping location, depth, and rate.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,128,,117-128,WOS:000468138400010,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.04.013,,#17449,Yu 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.04.013,,,,,
Spatial and temporal changes in groundwater salinity in South Florida,"Blanco, RI; Naja, GM; Rivero, RG; Price, RM","A combination of statistical and interpolation methods and Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis was used to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in groundwater Cl- concentrations in Collier and Lee Counties (southwestern Florida), and Miami-Dade and Broward Counties (southeastern Florida), since 1985. In southwestern Florida, the average Cl- concentrations in the shallow wells (0-43 m) in Collier and Lee Counties increased from 132 mg L-1 in 1985 to 230 mg L-1 in 2000. The average Cl- concentrations in the deep wells (> 43 m) of southwestern Florida increased from 392 mg L-1 in 1985 to 447 mg L-1 in 2000. Results also indicated a positive correlation between the mean sea level and Cl- concentrations and between the mean sea level and groundwater levels for the shallow wells. Concentrations in the Biscayne Aquifer (southeastern Florida) were significantly higher than those of southwestern Florida. The average Cl- concentrations increased from 159 mg L-1 in 1985 to 470 mg L-1 in 2010 for the shallow wells (<33 m) and from 1360 mg L-1 in 1985 to 2050 mg L-1 in 2010 for the deep wells (>33 m). In the Biscayne Aquifer, wells showed a positive or negative correlation between mean sea level and Cl- concentrations according to their location with respect to the saltwater intrusion line. Wells located inland behind canal control structures and west of the saltwater intrusion line showed negative correlation values, whereas wells located east of the saltwater intrusion line showed positive values. Overall, the results indicated that since 1985, there was a potential decline in the available freshwater resources estimated at about 12-17% of the available drinking-quality groundwater of the southeastern study area located in the Biscayne Aquifer.

Saltwater reduces potential CO2 and CH4 production in peat soils from a coastal freshwater forested wetland,"Minick, KJ; Mitra, B; Noormets, A; King, JS","A major concern for coastal freshwater wetland function and health is the effects of saltwater intrusion on greenhouse gas production from peat soils. Coastal freshwater forested wetlands are likely to experience increased hydroperiod with rising sea level, as well as saltwater intrusion. These potential changes to wetland hydrology may also alter forested wetland structure and lead to a transition from forest to shrub/marsh wetland ecosystems. Loss of forested wetlands is already evident by dying trees and dead standing trees (""ghost"" forests) along the Atlantic coast of the US, which will result in significant alterations to plant carbon (C) inputs, particularly that of coarse woody debris, to soils. We investigated the effects of salinity and wood C inputs on soils collected from a coastal freshwater forested wetland in North Carolina, USA, and incubated in the laboratory with either freshwater or saltwater (2.5 or 5.0 ppt) and with or without the additions of wood. Saltwater additions at 2.5 and 5.0 ppt reduced CO2 production by 41% and 37 %, respectively, compared to freshwater. Methane production was reduced by 98% (wood-free incubations) and by 75%-87% (wood-amended incubations) in saltwater treatments compared to the freshwater plus wood treatment. Additions of wood also resulted in lower CH4 production from the freshwater treatment and higher CH4 production from saltwater treatments compared to wood-free incubations. The delta(CH4)-C-13-C isotopic signature suggested that, in wood-free incubations, CH4 produced from the freshwater treatment originated primarily from the acetoclastic pathway, while CH4 produced from the saltwater treatments originated primarily from the hydrogenotrophic pathway. These results suggest that saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater forested wetlands will reduce CH4 production, but long-term changes in C dynamics will likely depend on how changes in wetland vegetation and microbial function influence C cycling in peat soils.",2019,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,16,23,4671-4686,WOS:000502281100001,10.5194/bg-16-4671-2019,,#17471,Minick 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4671-2019,US,North Carolina,USA,,
Impacts of Receding of the Lakes Located in the Arid and Semi-arid Areas on the Coastal Groundwater: Integrated Modeling and Experimental Study,"Motallebian, M; Ahmadi, H; Raoof, A; Cartwright, N","The dropping of the water level of the lakes located in the arid lands leads to salt concentration increase. In this study, a combined experimental-computational method is developed to explore the effect of seawater concentration on the elevation of groundwater table and the rate of saltwater intrusion, while the lake water level is dropping. At the laboratory tank scale, we have collected experimental data by varying the saltwater concentration by 2.0 and 2.5 times its initial value while measuring the height of the groundwater table. Our simulation has shown an unexpected increase in height of groundwater by 5.0 and 13.0% relative to the head difference at the boundaries of the domain. Also, the intrusion rate of saltwater wedge increased by 2.0 and 3.0 times, respectively. We have used the verified model for a field state and found that if density variations are neglected in simulation, the calculated groundwater level is affected more than 2 times in response to fluctuation of lake water level (relative to simulations by including the effect of fluid density changes). Based on the results density variations can counteract; even reverse, the effect of water table changes. Remarkably, our simulations have shown that despite a severe decrease in the water level of a saline lake over time, the saltwater wedge has indeed intruded further because of the substantial increase in the density of the lake water due to the rising salinity. Based on the findings, to reach a reasonable result in the study of interaction between saline water of shrinking lakes with coastal groundwater, saltwater concentration as well as saline water density in the modeling must be considered.",2022,,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,36,11,4057-4080,WOS:000826820300001,10.1007/s11269-022-03236-8,,#17487,Motallebian 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03236-8,,,,,
Salt intrusion at a submarine spring in a fringing reef lagoon,"Parra, SM; Valle-Levinson, A; Marino-Tapia, I; Enriquez, C","Variations in discharge and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) were studied at a point-source submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), within a fringing reef lagoon, from quadrature (neap) to syzygy (spring) tides. The principal factors affecting discharge and TKE variations were tides and waves. Field data indicated discharge, and TKE varied with high and low tides, and with quadrature and syzygy. Maximum discharge and TKE values were observed during low tides when the hydrostatic pressure over the jet was minimal, while the lowest discharge and TKE values were found at high tides. Syzygy tides produced consistent saltwater intrusion during high tides, while quadrature tides produced the greatest TKE values. In general, as the discharge intensified during low tides, jet temperatures decreased suggesting that waters originated further within the aquifer. At the same time jet salinities increased, suggesting a mixing of aquifer and seawater. To reconcile these two seemingly opposing views, it is proposed that the jet conduit is connected to a stratified chamber with seawater below brackish water. The greatest subtidal discharge occurred during quadrature tides. Syzygy produced low subtidal discharge driven by flow reversals (flow into the aquifer) observed throughout syzygy high tides in conjunction with the peak wave setup (>5 cm) observed during a storm. While tides were the primary driving force of the discharge, waves played a nonnegligible role. Wave effects on the discharge were most evident during syzygy high tides combined with a storm, when the subtidal spring discharge was weakest and salt intrusion developed.",2015,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,120,4,2736-2750,WOS:000354417200020,10.1002/2014JC010459,,#17492,Parra 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010459,,,,,
Investigation of transient freshwater storage in island aquifers,"Bedekar, VS; Memari, SS; Clement, TP","Fresh groundwater in an island aquifer is an extremely important resource that is highly vulnerable to variations in natural weather cycles and climate change effects. On small islands, precipitation creates subsurface freshwater lenses that float on top of coalesced saltwater that has intruded from the surrounding seawater. The volume and shape of these highly vulnerable freshwater lenses depend on the size and shape of the island, underlying geology, and the rate and duration of groundwater recharge. This study focuses on the transient changes in freshwater storage volume within these lenses. We completed a sand tank experiment to visualize an evolving freshwater lens that undergoes a dry- and -wet recharge cycle resulting in forming a shrinking and an expanding lens. The physical experiments provided a dataset to develop a robust numerical model that can rigorously simulate different types of evolving transient freshwater lenses. Our laboratory data along with past literature information have indicated that the shrinking of a freshwater lens occurred at a slower rate relative to an expanding freshwater lens. This aspect of a rather rapid freshwater volume recovery was investigated further using the numerical model by imposing cyclic recharge patterns to study the impacts of shortened recharge periods on freshwater storage in island aquifers. The results show that a sustainable dynamic equilibrium condition can be achieved within a few cycles of periodic recharge. Unsustainable conditions were only encountered at extremely short recharge periods. The model was then extended to simulate a freshwater lens in Dauphin Island, Alabama, to assess changes in freshwater storage under realistic wet and dry recharge cycles. The experimental data together with the modeling results presented in this study provide a better understanding of transient changes in freshwater storage patterns in small islands.",2019,,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,221,,98-107,WOS:000460827500009,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.02.004,,#17506,Bedekar 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.02.004,Dauphin Island,Alabama,,,

Recently developed techniques, including a flexible vertical grid system and a 2nd-order, monotone and implicit transport solver are critical in successfully capturing the baroclinic responses. Most importantly, good accuracy is achieved through an accurate representation of the underlying bathymetry, without any smoothing. The model in general exhibits a good skill for all hydrodynamic variables: the averaged root-mean-square errors (RMSE's) in the Bay are 9 cm for sub-tidal frequency elevation, 17 cm/s for 3D velocity time series, 1.5 PSU and 1.9 PSU for surface and bottom salinity respectively, 1.1 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C for surface and bottom temperature respectively. On the shelf, the average RMSE for the surface temperature is 1.4 degrees C.

Disturbance legacies regulate coastal forest soil stability to changing salinity and inundation: A soil transplant experiment,"Hopple, AM; Pennington, SC; Megonigal, JP; Bailey, V; Bond-Lamberty, B","Coastal forests worldwide are vulnerable to a dramatic transition from upland to wetland as sea-level rise accelerates and regimes of precipitation and storms change. However, the biogeochemical impacts of shifting salinity and inundation disturbance that foreshadow forest to wetland state transitions are largely unknown. This experiment used a natural salinity gradient in a tidal creek in eastern Maryland, U.S.A., to examine how soil respiration and chemistry may change under novel salinity and inundation disturbance regimes. Soil monoliths were transplanted in a reciprocal design among plots varying in seawater exposure and elevation above the creek. We monitored the monoliths' carbon dioxide (CO2) flux for two years and performed soil chemical analyses at the end of the experiment. Soil CO2 flux was affected by changing disturbance regimes and responses were dependent upon the salinity and inundation legacies associated with each study location. Lowland soil CO2 flux was resistant to changing salinity and inundation disturbance, with transplanted soil monolith chemistry composition in between that of its origin and destination. Conversely, upland soil CO2 flux was sensitive to changing salinity and inundation disturbance and remained suppressed throughout the 2-year study when exposed to wetter, saline conditions. Additionally, transplanted upland soil chemistry composition was like that of its destination, rather than origin, with upland soils displaying higher pH, base saturation, and nutrient availability relative to lowland soils. We hypothesize that reductions in soil respiration rates were driven by loss of soil nutrients and osmotic and redox stress on microbial communities following exposure to seawater. Together, our results suggest that disturbance legacies shape coastal forest soil responses to changing salinity and inundation disturbance regimes. However, fully understanding the dependence of system responses on disturbance legacies requires future study across a variety of systems and spatial and temporal scales.",2022,,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,169,,,WOS:000797329100001,10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108675,,#17538,Hopple 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108675,Maryland,U.S.A.,,,

Experiment and Numerical Simulation of Seawater Intrusion under the Influences of Tidal Fluctuation and Groundwater Exploitation in Coastal Multilayered Aquifers,"Guo, QN; Huang, JW; Zhou, ZF; Wang, JG","The dynamic behavior of groundwater flow and salt transport is affected by tide and pumping in coastal multilayered aquifers. In this paper, two groups of experiments were conducted considering different constant head inland boundaries. The fluctuation of the groundwater level and the process of seawater intrusion in the multilayered aquifers were observed. A two-dimensional SEAWAT model is developed to simulate the seawater intrusion to coastal aquifers under the influences of tidal fluctuation and groundwater exploitation. The hydrogeological parameters in the model are calibrated by the records of the groundwater level and salinity measurements. The results showed that the simulated groundwater level and salt concentration match the observation well. The groundwater level has the characteristics of periodic fluctuation with tide. The lag time of the groundwater level fluctuation in each monitoring point increases slightly with the increasing distance from the saltwater chamber. For the low tide, the inland freshwater recharge has main effect on groundwater level fluctuation. The rising tide has a negative effect on the drawdown of the groundwater level induced by pumping. For the high tide, the tide plays a major role on groundwater level fluctuation, compared with the inland freshwater recharge. Compared with the condition of high head of inland recharge, larger saltwater intrusion lengths and area have been observed and simulated in the aquifer, which means that faster inland motion of the seawater wedge would occur when the inland recharge is small in the coastal aquifers. It revealed that inland recharge plays a major role in the seawater intrusion for the same pumping rate of groundwater in different seasons. The analysis provides insights into how the tide fluctuation, groundwater pumping, and inland recharge effect on the area and rates of seawater intrusion.",2019,,GEOFLUIDS,2019,,,WOS:000477831600001,10.1155/2019/2316271,,#17546,Guo 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2316271,,,,,
"Groundwater level observations in 250,000 coastal US wells reveal scope of potential seawater intrusion","Jasechko, S; Perrone, D; Seybold, H; Fan, Y; Kirchner, JW","Seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers can increase groundwater salinity beyond potable levels, endangering access to freshwater for millions of people. Seawater intrusion is particularly likely where water tables lie below sea level, but can also arise from groundwater pumping in some coastal aquifers with water tables above sea level. Nevertheless, no nation-wide, observation-based assessment of the scope of potential seawater intrusion exists. Here we compile and analyze similar to 250,000 coastal groundwater-level observations made since the year 2000 in the contiguous United States. We show that the majority of observed groundwater levels lie below sea level along more than 15% of the contiguous coastline. We conclude that landward hydraulic gradients characterize a substantial fraction of the East Coast (>18%) and Gulf Coast (>17%), and also parts of the West Coast where groundwater pumping is high. Sea level rise, coastal land subsidence, and increasing water demands will exacerbate the threat of seawater intrusion. The authors here investigate in the susceptibility of coastal aquifers to seawater intrusion.

The effects of subterranean estuary dynamics on nutrient resource ratio availability to microphytobenthos in a coastal lagoon,"Rocha, C; Jiang, S; Ibanhez, JSP; Yang, Q; Mazi, K; Koussis, AD","Causal links between subterranean estuary (STE) dynamics, their climatological drivers, and the ecology of coastal eco-systems have remained elusive. Yet, establishing these connections is essential for fully integrated management of coastal ecosystems. We test, in a semi-arid climate, whether the composition of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to a lagoon can be regulated by the annual oscillation of the local STE, itself driven by groundwater recharge variability. We study STE outflow samples gathered monthly for a year in the Ria Formosa lagoon, examining the temporal dynamics of salinity, EH, pH (Total scale), dissolved oxygen and nutrient (PO43-, NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, and Si(OH)(4)) concentrations under the local hydrological regime. The objectives were threefold: (1) to determine the annual variability of nutrient content and N:P:Si stoichiometry in SGD into the lagoon; (2) to identify the main drivers of variability in SGD composition and stoichiometry and their interactive effects; (3) to discuss links to, and implications for, ecosystem function that could help define expectations of cause-effect relationships and be useful for environmental management of the lagoon and similar systems elsewhere.We find that the terrestrial groundwater recharge cycle drives the expansion and contraction of the subterranean estuary on annual timescales, causing the pH of SGD to fluctuate in opposition to continental groundwater level. The annual dynamics of the STE and the resulting pH oscillation determine the annual variability of nutrient composition ratio in SGD and shape benthic primary production dynamics. When saltwater intrusion occurs, the pH within SGD increases, enhancing nitrification and desorption of exchangeable phosphorus, while silicate fluxes increase with sea-water retreat. The result is that nutrient resource ratio availability for coastal primary production depends on the fresh groundwater level. This implies that ecosystem function in such systems is more tightly related to the dynamics of linked groundwater reservoirs than previously thought.",2022,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,851,,,WOS:000861087300004,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157522,,#17554,Rocha 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157522,NO3-,Si(OH)(4,,,
"Restoration of Isles Dernieres, Louisiana: Some reflections on morphodynamic approaches in the northern Gulf of Mexico to conserve Coastal/Marine systems","Khalil, SM; Lee, DM","The Isles Dernieres barrier island chain, located along the southern Louisiana coast, USA, displays some of the highest rates of erosion for any coastal region in the world, Between 1887 and 1988, the average annual rate of land loss was 28.2 ha yr(-1) whereas the average rate of Gulf shoreline retreat was 11.1 in yr(-1) (McBRIDE et al., 1991). This condition contributed to landward migration (barrier island rollover) and rapid disintegration of the Isles Dernieres sedimentary system. Failure of the barrier decreased the natural protective capacity of the island to maintain the adjacent mainland marshes and wetlands from the effects of storm surge, saltwater intrusion, increased tidal prism, and energetic storm waves (MCBRIDE and BYRNES, 1997). The modem islands are transgressive products of hundreds of years of persistent inundation and shoreline retreat, which has led to the formation of five separate barriers that include: Wine Island, East Island, Trinity Island, Whiskey Island, and Raccoon Island. Modern morphodynamic evolution of these islands is related to high rates of land loss, synergistic effects of relative sea-level rise, land subsidence, tropical and extra-tropical storm activity, inadequate sediment supply, and anthropogenic disturbances (BOYD and PENLAND, 1981; LIST et al.., 1997; PENLAND and RAMSEY, 1990; ROBERTS et al., 1987). In response to accelerated land loss along the fringing mainland marshes, due to continued deterioration of barrier island ecosystems, the State of Louisiana developed near-term strategy in 1993 for large-scale restoration through dedicated dredging of sand. The primary objective of the project was to attempt quasi-stabilization of the landward retreating and disappearing Isles Dernieres by adding sediment to the barrier system and by facilitating vegetative growth on dunes and in marshes to protect the lower Terrebonne Basin estuarine system. The specific goals of the project were to (1) increase the height and width of the islands using dredged sediments; and (2) reduce the loss of dredged sediments through sand fencing and subsequent planting to establish a protective cover on the artificial fill surface. Quantitative evaluation of these goals indicated how well the project objectives were met. Near-vertical aerial photography of the project area and LIDAR surveys facilitated the assessment of project performance. Conclusions are based on the analysis of topographic data collected pre- and post-construction, efficacy of sand fencing, and growth of vegetation on Whiskey, East and Trinity islands. The results of the restoration effort with respect to volumetric changes indicate that the goals were achieved with plausible increase in the longevity of the islands. It was observed that the total habitat area increased, predominantly the bare-land, some times at the expense of other habitats. The survival of the vegetative plantings on the three islands varied due to drought. Initial assessments of the planted vegetation indicate that the planted species dominated in the planted areas but they did not extend significantly to the implanted areas depicting. a lack of spread.",2006,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,65-71,WOS:000202961300011,,,#17557,Khalil 2006,,,https://doi.org/nan,Louisiana,al.,USA,Wine Island,East Island
Denitrification Potential and Carbon Mineralization in Restored and Unrestored Coastal Wetland Soils Across an Urban Landscape,"Doroski, AA; Helton, AM; Vadas, TM","The recovery of wetland function after tidal flow restoration may be influenced by water pollution and sea level rise. Our objective was to examine the effects of tidal flow restoration on denitrification potential and carbon (C) mineralization across an urban coastal landscape. Soil cores were collected from 32 tidal wetlands in Connecticut, U.S.A., spanning a wide range of salinity (0.3-29 ppt) and watershed development (<1-79%). In brackish wetlands, denitrification potential increased with time since restoration, while C mineralization showed no significant relationship. Soil chemistry was also a strong predictor of process rates; best fit multiple linear regression models for denitrification included both soil chemistry variables and time since restoration. Although principal components analysis revealed soil chemistry overlapped by wetland type (freshwater, saline, or brackish), process rates in freshwater versus brackish wetlands had different relationships with soil chemistry. In freshwater wetlands, denitrification potential and C mineralization increased with soil metal content. In brackish wetlands, denitrification potential decreased with increasing salinity and C mineralization increased with increasing organic matter, soil moisture, and ammonium. Our results highlight the potential for biogeochemical processes to recover after wetland restoration, along with complex interactions between these processes and chemicals in developed coastal landscapes.",2019,,WETLANDS,39,4,895-906,WOS:000485037400017,10.1007/s13157-019-01128-z,,#17559,Doroski 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-019-01128-z,Connecticut,U.S.A.,,,
Untangling complex shallow groundwater dynamics in the floodplain wetlands of a southeastern US coastal river,"Kaplan, D; Munoz-Carpena, R; Ritter, A","Understanding the hydrological functioning of tidally influenced floodplain forests is essential for advancing ecosystem protection and restoration goals in impacted systems. However, finding direct relationships between basic hydrological inputs and floodplain hydrology is hindered by complex interactions between surface water, groundwater, and atmospheric fluxes in a variably saturated matrix with heterogeneous soils, vegetation, and topography. Thus, an explanatory method for identifying common trends and causal factors is required. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA), a time series dimension reduction technique, models temporal variation in observed data as linear combinations of common trends, which represent unidentified common factors, and explanatory variables. In this work, DFA was applied to model water table elevation (WTE) in the floodplain of the Loxahatchee River (Florida, USA), where altered watershed hydrology has led to changing hydroperiod and salinity regimes and undesired vegetative changes in the floodplain forest. The technique proved to be a powerful tool for the study of interactions among 29 long-term, nonstationary hydrological time series (12 WTE series and 17 candidate explanatory variables). Regional groundwater circulation, surface water elevations, and spatially variable net local recharge (cumulative rainfall - cumulative evapotranspiration) were found to be the main factors explaining groundwater profiles. The relative importance of these factors was spatially related to floodplain elevation, distance from the river channel, and distance upstream from the river mouth. The resulting dynamic factor model (DFM) simulated the WTE time series well (overall coefficient of efficiency, C-eff = 0.91) and is useful for assessing management scenarios for ecosystem restoration and predicted sea level rise.",2010,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,46,,,WOS:000280960900003,10.1029/2009WR009038,,#17563,Kaplan 2010,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2009WR009038,Florida,USA,,,
"The Effect of Hurricane Irma Storm Surge on the Freshwater Lens in Big Pine Key, Florida using Electrical Resistivity Tomography","Kiflai, ME; Whitman, D; Ogurcak, DE; Ross, M","Animals and plants on low elevation oceanic islands often rely on a thin lens of fresh groundwater and this lens is vulnerable to seawater contamination from storm surge. Documentation of the impact of the storm surge on the freshwater lens and its subsequent recovery is limited. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys as a category 4 storm with storm surge heights in excess of 2 m. This study used Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to investigate the effect of the storm surge on the freshwater lens of Big Pine Key, FL. The study compared ERT images along three profiles ranging between 220 and 280 m length collected in 2011 with post storm data collected about 3 to 4 months (November 2017/January 2018) and eight (May 2018) months after Irma. The post storm data documented that the storm surge impacted the freshwater lens on all three profiles with low resistivity (i.e., high salinity) zones in the upper 2 m of the groundwater. The increase in salinity was most pronounced in the lower elevations of the profiles. The May 2018 data were collected immediately after 2 weeks of intense precipitation. These data showed 40% recovery of the freshwater lens, most pronounced in the lower elevation of the profiles. This suggests that both the impact of storm surge and the freshwater recovery due to precipitation are most pronounced in low elevation regions where both saline and freshwater can collect at the surface.",2020,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,43,5,1032-1044,WOS:000495741300001,10.1007/s12237-019-00666-3,,#17576,Kiflai 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00666-3,,,,,
Sustainability strategies for coastal aquifers: A case study of the Hermosillo Coast aquifer,"Quintana, DSZ; Renteria, CML; Vega, NEM; Peralta, JE; Contreras, LEV","Inadequate water management stresses water resources, impacting not only economic but also social and environmental sectors. Its consequences negatively impact the gross domestic product of affected countries by limiting economic growth. Arid coastal regions are the most severely affected due to the confluence of periods of greater demand and periods of greater scarcity. In such regions, the most reliable sources of fresh water are coastal aquifers (CAs); however, due to their current overexploitation, CAs are encountering problems such as marine intrusion (MI). In Mexico, the Costa de Hermosillo aquifer (CHA) is one of the most exploited, and at present it is experiencing the negative consequences of MI, which are harming not only quality of life of the inhabitants but also irreparably damaging the regional environment. This article aims to formulate a coastal aquifer management plan through a case study that takes environmental costs into consideration to support decision-making processes and seeks to show how sustainability strategies can be applied to recover, conserve, and sustainably exploit CAs water resources. The originality/value of this paper is the interaction of the sustainability pillars that allowed an environmental accounting evaluation as a step toward the implementation of future holistic strategies to facilitate water resource management in a sustainable development framework.

"The case of the Biscayne Bay and aquifer near Miami, Florida: density-driven flow of seawater or gravitationally driven discharge of deep saline groundwater?","Weyer, KU","Coastal groundwater flow investigations at the Cutler site of the Biscayne Bay south of Miami, Florida, gave rise to the dominating concept of density-driven flow of seawater into coastal aquifers indicated as a saltwater wedge. Within that wedge, convection-type return flow of seawater and a dispersion zone were concluded to be the cause of the Biscayne aquifer 'seawater wedge.' This conclusion was merely based on the chloride distribution within the aquifer and on an analytical model concept assuming convection flow within a confined aquifer without taking non-chemical field data into consideration. This concept was later labeled the 'Henry problem,' which any numerical variable-density flow program has to be able to simulate to be considered acceptable. Revisiting the summarizing publication with its record of piezometric field data (heads) showed that the so-called seawater wedge was actually caused by discharging deep saline groundwater driven by regional gravitational groundwater flow systems. Density-driven flow of seawater into the aquifer was not found reflected in the head measurements for low and high tide which had been taken contemporaneously with the chloride measurements. These head measurements had not been included in the assumption of a seawater wedge and associated dispersion zone and convection cell. The Biscayne situation emphasizes the need for any chemical interpretation of flow pattern to be backed up by head data as energy indicators of flow fields. At the Biscayne site density-driven flow of seawater did not and does not exist. This conclusion was confirmed by five independent methods. The hydrostatic use of vertical buoyancy forces needs, under hydrodynamic boundary conditions, to be replaced with buoyancy forces along the direction of the pressure potential forces [(grad p)/density] which, in the subsurface, can be pointed in any direction in space.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,77,1,,WOS:000424366000001,10.1007/s12665-017-7169-5,,#17594,Weyer 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-7169-5,Miami,Florida,Biscayne,,
Response and Recovery of Low-Salinity Marsh Plant Communities to Presses and Pulses of Elevated Salinity,"Li, F; Pennings, SC","In estuaries, future variation in sea level and river discharge will lead to saline intrusion into low-salinity tidal marshes. To investigate the processes that control the differential response and recovery of tidal freshwater marsh plant communities to saline pulses, a 3x5 factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a range of salinity levels (3, 5, and 10practical salinity units (PSU)) and pulse durations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30days per month) on community composition of tidal freshwater marsh vegetation. Recovery of perturbed communities was also examined after 10months. The results showed that community composition was increasingly affected by the more-saline and longer-duration treatments. The increasing suppression of salt-sensitive species resulted in species reordering, decreased species richness, and decreased aboveground biomass. Most of the plant species were able to recover from low-salinity, short-duration saline pulses in less than 1year. However, because not all species recovered in the heavily salinized treatments, species richness at the end of the recovery period remained low for treatments that were heavily salinized during the treatment period. In contrast, plant aboveground biomass fully recovered in the heavily salinized treatments. Although the magnitude and duration of pulsed environmental changes had strong effects on community composition, shifts in community composition prevented long-term reductions in productivity. Thus, in this study system, environmental change affected species composition more strongly than it did ecosystem processes.",2019,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,42,3,708-718,WOS:000463827200008,10.1007/s12237-018-00490-1,,#17595,Li 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-00490-1,,,,,
Seawater transport through quartz pores of coastal aquifers: A molecular dynamics study,"Burgos, JC; Quinones-Bolanos, E; Saghir, MZ; Mehrvar, M","Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to analyze the diffusion of saltwater in aquifers at a salinity of 3.5 wt%, and temperatures between 5 and 50 ?. Porous systems were built from the quartz stable alpha phase to represent typical compositions and structures reported for aquifer surfaces. The SPC/E model was used to describe the interactions between water molecules in the system, while the quartz intramolecular bonds were characterized through a Buckingham-type potential. It was demonstrated from MD trajectories that the diffusivity in small pores of both, water molecules and NaCl ions, depends strongly on the crystallographic orientation of quartz surfaces exposed to the quartz/saltwater interface. The three most stable quartz surfaces, favor the diffusion of Na+ over Cl- in confinement, principally due to strong nonbonded interactions between chloride and silicon atoms with partial positive charges that remain exposed at surface terminations. The exposed quartz surfaces also determined the structure of confined water and the distribution of ions along the normal direction of the pore surfaces. The results reported in this study provide a molecular-scale description of the diffusive transport of seawater through quartz pores, which represents a potential scenario for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers.",2022,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,161,,,WOS:000788071100001,10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.104121,,#17600,Burgos 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.104121,MD,Buckingham,,,
Investigating how river flow regimes impact on river delta salinization through idealized modeling,"Matsoukis, C; Amoudry, LO; Bricheno, L; Leonardi, N","IntroductionExcessive salinity can harm ecosystems and compromise the various anthropogenic activities that take place in river deltas. The issue of salinization is expected to exacerbate due to natural and/or anthropogenic climate change. Water regulations are required to secure a sufficient water supply in conditions of limited water volume availability. Research is ongoing in seek of the optimum flow distribution establishing longer lasting and fresher conditions in deltas. MethodsIn this study a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model built for an idealized delta configuration was utilized to investigate how different river discharge annual distributions affect saltwater in deltas. Five simulations were carried out by implementing annual distributions of equal water volume but different shape. ResultsThe results showed that peak flow magnitude, time of occurrence and the length of a hydrograph's tails can be important parameters affecting stratification, freshwater residence, and renewal times. Hydrographs of small flow range and light tails were the most successful in keeping the delta and its trunk channel fresher for longer periods. Salinity distributions showed a slower response to decreasing rather than increasing river discharges. An increase in the flow rate can result in salinity standards demanded for certain activities (e.g., farming, irrigation etc.) in much shorter times. On the other hand, hydrographs with heavy tails can push the salt intrusion limit further away and be more efficient in mixing the water column. However, they present low freshwater residence and high-water renewal times. DiscussionThese results provide strong indications that it is possible to improve the freshwater conditions in deltas without seeking for additional water resources but by modifying the water distribution. The main outcomes of this work may be able to support and assist coastal scientists and stakeholders dealing with the management of freshwater resources in river deltas across the world.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000933837200001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1075683,,#17616,Matsoukis 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1075683,,,,,
Groundwater Throughflow and Seawater Intrusion in High Quality Coastal Aquifers,"Costall, AR; Harris, BD; Teo, B; Schaa, R; Wagner, FM; Pigois, JP","High quality coastal aquifer systems provide vast quantities of potable groundwater for millions of people worldwide. Managing this setting has economic and environmental consequences. Specific knowledge of the dynamic relationship between fresh terrestrial groundwater discharging to the ocean and seawater intrusion is necessary. We present multi- disciplinary research that assesses the relationships between groundwater throughflow and seawater intrusion. This combines numerical simulation, geophysics, and analysis of more than 30 years of data from a seawater intrusion monitoring site. The monitoring wells are set in a shallow karstic aquifer system located along the southwest coast of Western Australia, where hundreds of gigalitres of fresh groundwater flow into the ocean annually. There is clear evidence for seawater intrusion along this coastal margin. We demonstrate how hydraulic anisotropy will impact on the landward extent of seawater for a given groundwater throughflow. Our examples show how the distance between the ocean and the seawater interface toe can shrink by over 100% after increasing the rotation angle of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy when compared to a homogeneous aquifer. We observe extreme variability in the properties of the shallow aquifer from ground penetrating radar, hand samples, and hydraulic parameters estimated from field measurements. This motived us to complete numerical experiments with sets of spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields, representative of karstic aquifers. The hydraulic conductivity proximal to the zone of submarine groundwater discharge is shown to be significant in determining the overall geometry and landward extent of the seawater interface. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) data was acquired and assessed for its ability to recover the seawater interface. Imaging outcomes from field ERI data are compared with simulated ERI outcomes derived from transport modelling with a range of hydraulic conductivity distributions. This process allows for interpretation of the approximate geometry of the seawater interface, however recovery of an accurate resistivity distribution across the wedge and mixing zone remains challenging. We reveal extremes in groundwater velocity, particularly where fresh terrestrial groundwater discharges to the ocean, and across the seawater recirculation cell. An overarching conclusion is that conventional seawater intrusion monitoring wells may not be suitable to constrain numerical simulation of the seawater intrusion. Based on these lessons, we present future options for groundwater monitoring that are specifically designed to quantify the distribution of; (i) high vertical and horizontal pressure gradients, (ii) sharp variations in subsurface flow velocity, (iii) extremes in hydraulic properties, and (iv) rapid changes in groundwater chemistry. These extremes in parameter distribution are common in karstic aquifer systems at the transition from land to ocean. Our research provides new insights into the behaviour of groundwater in dynamic, densely populated, and ecologically sensitive coastal environments found worldwide.",2020,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10,1,,WOS:000543960400008,10.1038/s41598-020-66516-6,,#17619,Costall 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66516-6,,,,,
A Generalized Semi-Analytical Solution for the Dispersive Henry Problem: Effect of Stratification and Anisotropy on Seawater Intrusion,"Fahs, M; Koohbor, B; Belfort, B; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Simmons, CT; Younes, A; Ackerer, P","The Henry problem (HP) continues to play a useful role in theoretical and practical studies related to seawater intrusion (SWI) into coastal aquifers. The popularity of this problem is attributed to its simplicity and precision to the existence of semi-analytical (SA) solutions. The first SA solution has been developed for a high uniform diffusion coefficient. Several further studies have contributed more realistic solutions with lower diffusion coefficients or velocity-dependent dispersion. All the existing SA solutions are limited to homogenous and isotropic domains. This work attempts to improve the realism of the SA solution of the dispersive HP by extending it to heterogeneous and anisotropic coastal aquifers. The solution is obtained using the Fourier series method. A special hydraulic conductivity-depth model describing stratified heterogeneity is used for mathematical convenience. An efficient technique is developed to solve the flow and transport equations in the spectral space. With this technique, we show that the HP can be solved in the spectral space with the salt concentration as primary unknown. Several examples are generated, and the SA solutions are compared against an in-house finite element code. The results provide high-quality data assessed by quantitative indicators that can be effectively used for code verification in realistic configurations of heterogeneity and anisotropy. The SA solution is used to explain contradictory results stated in the previous works about the effect of anisotropy on the saltwater wedge. It is also used to investigate the combined influence of stratification and anisotropy on relevant metrics characterizing SWI. At a constant gravity number, anisotropy leads to landward migration of the saltwater wedge, more intense saltwater flux, a wider mixing zone and shallower groundwater discharge zone to the sea. The influence of stratified heterogeneity is more pronounced in highly anisotropic aquifers. The stratification rate and anisotropy have complementary effects on all SWI metrics, except for the depth of the discharge zone.",2018,,WATER,10,2,,WOS:000426775500140,10.3390/w10020230,,#17621,Fahs 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/w10020230,Henry,,,,
The Henry problem: New semianalytical solution for velocity-dependent dispersion,"Fahs, M; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Younes, A; Simmons, CT; Ackerer, P","A new semianalytical solution is developed for the velocity-dependent dispersion Henry problem using the Fourier-Galerkin method (FG). The integral arising from the velocity-dependent dispersion term is evaluated numerically using an accurate technique based on an adaptive scheme. Numerical integration and nonlinear dependence of the dispersion on the velocity render the semianalytical solution impractical. To alleviate this issue and to obtain the solution at affordable computational cost, a robust implementation for solving the nonlinear system arising from the FG method is developed. It allows for reducing the number of attempts of the iterative procedure and the computational cost by iteration. The accuracy of the semianalytical solution is assessed in terms of the truncation orders of the Fourier series. An appropriate algorithm based on the sensitivity of the solution to the number of Fourier modes is used to obtain the required truncation levels. The resulting Fourier series are used to analytically evaluate the position of the principal isochlors and metrics characterizing the saltwater wedge. They are also used to calculate longitudinal and transverse dispersive fluxes and to provide physical insight into the dispersion mechanisms within the mixing zone. The developed semianalytical solutions are compared against numerical solutions obtained using an in house code based on variant techniques for both space and time discretization. The comparison provides better confidence on the accuracy of both numerical and semianalytical results. It shows that the new solutions are highly sensitive to the approximation techniques used in the numerical code which highlights their benefits for code benchmarking.",2016,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,52,9,7382-7407,WOS:000386977900038,10.1002/2016WR019288,,#17623,Fahs 2016,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019288,,,,,
Occurrence of seawater intrusion overshoot,"Morgan, LK; Bakker, M; Werner, AD","A number of numerical modeling studies of transient sea level rise (SLR) and seawater intrusion (SI) in flux-controlled aquifer systems have reported an overshoot phenomenon, whereby the freshwater-saltwater interface temporarily extends further inland than the eventual steady state position. Recently, physical sand-tank modeling has shown overshoot to be a physical process. In this paper, we have carried out numerical modeling of SLR-SI to demonstrate that overshoot can occur at the field scale within unconfined aquifers. This result is contrary to previous conclusions drawn from a restricted number of cases. In addition, we show that SI overshoot is plausible under scenarios of gradual sea level rise that are consistent with conditions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Overshoot was found to be largest in flux-controlled unconfined aquifers characterized by low freshwater flux, high specific yield, and large inland extent. These conditions result in longer timeframes for the aquifer to reach new steady state conditions following SLR, and the extended period prior to reequilibration of the groundwater flow field produces more extensive overshoot.",2015,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,51,4,1989-1999,WOS:000354733500007,10.1002/2014WR016329,,#17640,Morgan 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2014WR016329,,,,,
Bridging groundwater models and decision support with a Bayesian network,"Fienen, MN; Masterson, JP; Plant, NG; Gutierrez, BT; Thieler, ER","Resource managers need to make decisions to plan for future environmental conditions, particularly sea level rise, in the face of substantial uncertainty. Many interacting processes factor in to the decisions they face. Advances in process models and the quantification of uncertainty have made models a valuable tool for this purpose. Long-simulation runtimes and, often, numerical instability make linking process models impractical in many cases. A method for emulating the important connections between model input and forecasts, while propagating uncertainty, has the potential to provide a bridge between complicated numerical process models and the efficiency and stability needed for decision making. We explore this using a Bayesian network (BN) to emulate a groundwater flow model. We expand on previous approaches to validating a BN by calculating forecasting skill using cross validation of a groundwater model of Assateague Island in Virginia and Maryland, USA. This BN emulation was shown to capture the important groundwater-flow characteristics and uncertainty of the groundwater system because of its connection to island morphology and sea level. Forecast power metrics associated with the validation of multiple alternative BN designs guided the selection of an optimal level of BN complexity. Assateague island is an ideal test case for exploring a forecasting tool based on current conditions because the unique hydrogeomorphological variability of the island includes a range of settings indicative of past, current, and future conditions. The resulting BN is a valuable tool for exploring the response of groundwater conditions to sea level rise in decision support.",2013,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,49,10,6459-6473,WOS:000327432500023,10.1002/wrcr.20496,,#17648,Fienen 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/wrcr.20496,Assateague Island,Virginia,Maryland,USA,

A brief discussion on previous methodology, novelty and limitations on direct simulation of SWI are tabulated. The significant aspects to be considered while direct modeling of coastal aquifers are discussed and the recent focus of research in this area of interest are stated.

Suspended sediment projections in Apalachicola Bay in response to altered river flow and sediment loads under climate change and sea level rise,"Huang, WR; Hagen, SC; Wang, DB; Hovenga, PA; Teng, F; Weishampel, JF","Suspended sediments, or total suspended solids (TSS), are an important factor for oyster habitat. While high concentrations of suspended sediments can cause a reduction of oyster density, some level of suspended sediment is required to supply oysters with necessary nutrients. In this study, characteristics of TSS variations in response to sea level rise (SLR) at two oyster reefs in Apalachicola Bay are investigated by coupled estuarine hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling. A storm event in 1993 and a year-long period in 2010 under recent sea level conditions are selected as the baseline conditions. Scenarios of river flow and sediment loads under SLR and climate change are obtained by downscaled global climate modeling. Compared to the baseline conditions, simulations of TSS indicate that predicted SLR yields a substantial decrease in TSS near the two oyster reefs. However, TSS levels differed at the two study locations. TSS changes by SLR revealed minimal impact on oyster habitat at the Dry Bar site (to the west of the mouth of the Apalachicola River) but are projected to have a significant impact at the Cat Point site (to the east of the Apalachicola River). At Cat Point, because SLR causes the increase of salt water intrusion from the Gulf through a large tidal inlet (East Pass), maximum sediment concentration is near zero for 0.2-m SLR and equal to zero for 0.5- and 1.2-m SLR.

It is hypothesized here that a self-reinforcing feedback, termed a ""vegetation switch,"" between vegetation and soil salinity, helps maintain the sharp mangrove-marsh ecotone. A general theoretical implication of the switch mechanism is that the ecotone will be stable to small disturbances but vulnerable to rapid regime shifts from large disturbances, such as storm surges, which could cause large spatial displacements of the ecotone. We develop a simulation model to describe the vegetation switch mechanism. The model couples vegetation dynamics and hydrologic processes. The key factors in the model are the amount of salt-water intrusion into the freshwater wetland and the passive transport of mangrove (e.g., Rhizophora mangle) viviparous seeds or propagules. Results from the model simulations indicate that a regime shift from freshwater marsh to mangroves is sensitive to the duration of soil salinization through storm surge overwash and to the density of mangrove propagules or seedlings transported into the marsh. We parameterized our model with empirical hydrologic data collected from the period 2000-2010 at one mangrove-marsh ecotone location in southwestern Florida to forecast possible long-term effects of Hurricane Wilma (24 October 2005). The model indicated that the effects of that storm surge were too weak to trigger a regime shift at the sites we studied, 50 km south of the Hurricane Wilma eyewall, but simulations with more severe artificial disturbances were capable of causing substantial regime shifts.",2014,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,37,1,24-35,WOS:000330588000002,10.1007/s12237-013-9666-4,,#17727,Jiang 2014,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9666-4,Florida,,,,
Forcing uncertainty and salinity response to dredging in a tidal freshwater river,"Miller, RL","This study evaluates the salinity response to dredging under different forcing regimes for a 75-kilometer segment of the flood-prone Vermilion River located in coastal Louisiana, USA. The Vermilion is a tidal freshwater river affected by baseflow regulation, rapid urbanization, and hydromodification. This river also serves as major freshwater resource for the region. An efficient one-dimensional model calibrated previously for stage and water temperature is used to analyse the salinity impacts due to a large-scale flood control dredging. The analysis is based on 200 alternative scenarios based on combinations of uncertain key forcing variables for a critical 13-day intrusion period. The analysis reveals a nonlinear effect on mean salinities and position of the brackish water limit as a function of uncertain forcing variables. Dredging also increases the variability of salinity encroachment effects due to uncertainty in future forcing conditions (e.g. relative sea level rise, baseflow diversion volumes, and salinities at the river mouth). The robust analysis presented here provides a foundation for future model-based assessments of under-studied tidal freshwater rivers and provides key insights for coastal management and sustainability efforts in general.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,21,2,243-251,WOS:000685732200001,10.1080/15715124.2021.1961795,,#17728,Miller 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2021.1961795,Louisiana,USA,,,
Using management to address vegetation stress related to land-use and climate change,"Middleton, BA; Boudell, J; Fisichelli, NA","While disturbances such as fire, cutting, and grazing can be an important part of the conservation of natural lands, some adjustments to management designed to mimic natural disturbance may be necessary with ongoing and projected climate change. Stressed vegetation that is incapable of regeneration will be difficult to maintain if adults are experiencing mortality, and/or if their early life-history stages depend on disturbance. A variety of active management strategies employing disturbance are suggested, including resisting, accommodating, or directing vegetation change by manipulating management intensity and frequency. Particularly if land-use change is the main cause of vegetation stress, amelioration of these problems using management may help vegetation resist change (e.g. strategic timing of water release if a water control structure is available). Managers could direct succession by using management to push vegetation toward a new state. Despite the historical effects of management, some vegetation change will not be controllable as climates shift, and managers may have to accept some of these changes. Nevertheless, proactive measures may help managers achieve important conservation goals in the future.",2017,,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,25,3,326-329,WOS:000402012700001,10.1111/rec.12507,,#17765,Middleton 2017,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.12507,,,,,
Estuarine tidal range dynamics under rising sea levels,"Khojasteh, D; Chen, SY; Felder, S; Heimhuber, V; Glamore, W","How an estuary responds to sea level rise (SLR) is complex and depends on energy drivers (e.g., tides and river inflows), estuarine geometry (e.g., length and depth), intrinsic fluid properties (e.g., density), and bed/bank roughness. While changes to the tidal range under SLR can impact estuarine sediment transport, water quality, and vegetation communities, studies on the altered tidal range under SLR are often based on case studies with outcomes applicable to a specific site. As such, this study produced a large ensemble of estuarine hydrodynamic models (>1800) to provide a systematic understanding of how tidal range dynamics within different estuary types may change under various SLR and river inflow scenarios. The results indicated that SLR often amplifies the tidal range of different estuary types, except for short estuaries with a low tidal range at the mouth where SLR attenuates the tides. SLR alters the location of the points with minimum tidal range and overall tidal range patterns in an estuary. Variations in tidal range were more evident in converging estuaries, shallower systems, or in estuaries with strong river inflows. These findings provide an indication of how different estuary types may respond to estuaries and may assist estuarine managers and decision makers.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,9,,WOS:000707078200044,10.1371/journal.pone.0257538,,#17788,Khojasteh 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257538,,,,,

SEA-LEVEL RISE AND THE REDUCTION IN PINE FORESTS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS,"ROSS, MS; OBRIEN, JJ; STERNBERG, LDL","Forests dominated by Pinus elliottii var densa have undergone a reduction in area in the Florida Keys (USA). A previous investigation interpreted the presence of halophytic species in a former pine forest in Key Large as evidence of sea-level rise. We therefore examined aerial photos and field evidence to learn how the 15-cm rise in local sea level over the last 70 yr had affected the distribution of pines on a second island, where intact pine forests still remained in 1991. The distribution of in situ dead pine stems showed that the area occupied by pines on Sugarloaf Key was 88 ha at some time prior to the earliest available aerial photographs, in 1935. The area of pine forest was reduced to 46 ha by 1935, and continued to decrease through 1991, when it covered 30 ha. The pattern of pine mortality was related to topographic position, with the areas where pines died earliest occupying the lowest elevations. Our analysis of current vegetation patterns showed that the areas of earliest pine mortality are now populated by a higher proportion of halophytic plant assemblages than areas of more recent pine mortality. We also compared the physiological responses of pines in two portions of the island: one where pine forest reduction had been most pronounced, and a second where the extent of the forest had changed little over the past 50 yr. Both groundwater and soil water salinity were higher in the area of rapid pine forest reduction, and the pines sampled there exhibited higher physiological stress, as indicated by pre-dawn water potential and stemwood carbon isotope ratios. These results suggest that the salinization of ground- and soil water that occurs as sea level rises is a major factor in the reduction of pine forests of Sugarloaf Key. If sea level continues to increase, the Florida Keys will experience a decline in both landscape and species diversity, as species-rich upland communities are replaced by simpler mangrove communities. This pattern may also occur in other low-lying island ecosystems with limited freshwater resources.",1994,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,4,1,144-156,WOS:A1994MU60500016,10.2307/1942124,,#17819,ROSS 1994,,,https://doi.org/10.2307/1942124,,,,,
A review of recent advances and future challenges in freshwater salinization,"Iglesias, MCA","In spite of being a worldwide phenomenon that can have important ecological, economic and social consequences, freshwater salinization (i.e. the increase in ion concentrations in freshwaters) has been poorly studied when compared with other environmental issues. However, it is receiving increasing attention, with significant scientific advances being made during the last two decades. Here I review the current knowledge on the topic and propose future research directions within the context of human welfare and global change. Freshwater salinization is caused by a wide range of human activities, with agriculture and resource extraction being the most widely documented. Different studies suggest that it could be affecting around 1/3 of freshwater bodies, and this number will very likely increase in the future due to climate and land use changes. The increase in the salinity of freshwaters is known to cause adverse effects on the fitness and survival of many aquatic organisms, however the osmoregulatory mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood. Moreover, it has been proved that different ions can have different toxicities to aquatic organisms, but most of the research has focused exclusively on Na+ and Cl-. Thus, more investigations on the potential effects of increasing concentrations of other specific ions (e.g. K+, SO42-) are needed. The impact of salinization on freshwater biodiversity can alter ecosystem functioning, although only a few functions have been studied (e.g. leaf litter decomposition). Also, freshwater salinization can affect the delivery of ecosystem services and have direct economic (e.g. infrastructure corrosion) and social (e.g. human health) impacts that have rarely been assessed. The management of this urgent environmental issue needs to be improved through mitigation (e.g. backfilling of mine tailings), remediation (e.g. enhanced wastewater treatment), prevention (e.g. using alternative deicers for roads) and monitoring (e.g. estimating salt loads to freshwater ecosystems) actions.",2020,,LIMNETICA,39,1,185-211,WOS:000509685900014,10.23818/limn.39.13,,#17880,Iglesias 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.23818/limn.39.13,,,,,
Increasing salinization of freshwater limits invasiveness of a live-bearing fish: Insights from behavioral and life-history traits,"Zhou, LJ; Liu, K; Zhao, Y; Cui, L; Dong, CL; Wang, ZZ","Biological invasions and continued salinization of freshwater are two global issues with largely serious ecological consequences. Increasing salinity in freshwater systems, as an environmental stressor, may negatively affect normal life activities in fish. It has been documented that salinity limits the invasive success of alien species by mediating physiological and life-history performances, however, there are few studies on how salinity affects its invasive process via altered behaviors. Using wild-caught invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as animal model, in this study, we asked whether gradual increasing salinity affects behaviors (personality and mate choice decision here), life-history traits, as well as the correlation between them by exposing G. affinis to three levels salinity (freshwater, 10 and 20 parts per thousand). Results showed that, with increased salinity, male tended to be shyer, less active, less sociable, and reduced desire to mate, and female tended to be shyer, less active and lost pref-erences for the larger male. Furthermore, across salinity treatments, male exhibited reduced body fat content and rising reproduction allocation, however, pregnant female revealed diametrically opposed trends. In addition, the correlation between life-history traits and behaviors was only identified in pregnant female. It seems that either salinity or life-history traits directly affects mosquitofish behaviors. In summary, our results partially emphasize the harmful consequences of salinity on both life-history traits and behavioral performances. These findings provide a novel perspective on how salinity potentially affect fish fitness via altering personalities, mate choice decisions, as well as body condition, and hence supports the idea that salinity could affect the spread of invasive mosquitofish.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,308,,,WOS:000822715000002,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119658,,#17892,Zhou 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119658,,,,,
'A commons before the sea:' climate justice considerations for coastal zone management,"Jurjonas, M; Seekamp, E","If climate change mitigation and adaptation are a human right, institutional change is needed that considers coastal ecosystem integrity as a common pool resource. Increasing risks in coastal zones necessitates adopting new and frequently controversial zoning, planning, and management practices, particularly as insurance programmes reform or require bailouts. In the U.S., current coastal policy frameworks employed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state-level authorities incentivize defensive strategies, especially in high-value tourism destinations, despite critiques of inequity and longer-term evidence demonstrating that hardening shorelines shifts erosion patterns. Other coastal regions and developing countries that cannot afford defensive strategies - particularly rural, minority, and impoverished communities located adjacent to estuarine areas - rely heavily on ecosystem services for protection and will likely disproportionately face buyouts, forced relocation, and retreat as seas rise.",2020,,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,12,3,199-203,WOS:000518862400001,10.1080/17565529.2019.1611533,,#17924,Jurjonas 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2019.1611533,U.S.,,,,
Multigenerational effects of salinity in six clonal lineages of Daphnia longispina,"Venancio, C; Ribeiro, R; Soares, AMVM; Lopes, I","Sea level rise, as a consequence of climate changes, is already causing seawater intrusion in some freshwater coastal ecosystems worldwide. The increase in salinity at these freshwater coastal ecosystems may occur gradually (through groundwater) or abruptly (through extreme weather events). Moreover, many of them are also being altered and threatened by anthropogenic activities. Accordingly, the present study aimed at assessing the multigenerational lethal and sublethal effects caused by increased salinity in six clonal lineages of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia longispina differing in their sensitivity to lethal levels of copper. Three specific objectives were delineated: i) to compare the lethal and sublethal toxicity of sodium chloride (NaCl) and natural seawater (SW); ii) to evaluate possible multigenerational effects after exposure to low levels of salinity, and iii) to evaluate if an association exists between tolerance to lethal and sublethal levels of salinity and tolerance to metals. Overall, NaCl was found to elicit sublethal effects at lower or similar concentrations than SW, suggesting its use as a protective surrogate of SW in early phases of ecological risk assessment schemes. Multigenerational exposure to conductivities of 0.73 +/- 0.015 mS cm(-1) led to dissimilar responses by the six clonal lineages. Significant associations were found neither between lethal and sublethal endpoints nor between salinity and metals, possibly indicating the absence of common mechanisms responsible to confer metal tolerance and salt stress. However, some clonal lineages presented an inverse sensitivity to lethal levels of NaCl and of copper. These results suggest that natural populations of D. longispina, by exhibiting clonal lineages with differential tolerance to increased salinity, may cope with long-term exposure to small increases of this stressor. However, over time those populations may face the occurrence of genetic erosion due to the loss of the most sensitive genotypes before or after a multigenerational exposure. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

MANTRA-O18: An Extended Version of SUTRA Modified to Simulate Salt and delta O-18 Transport amid Water Uptake by Plants,"Teh, SY; De Angelis, DL; Voss, CI; Sternberg, L; Koh, HL","Sea level rise and the increasing landward intrusion of storm surges pose the threat of replacement of salinity-intolerant vegetation of important coastal habitats by salinity-tolerant vegetation. Therefore, a means is needed to better understand the processes that influence this vegetation shift and to aid in the management of coastal resources. For this purpose, a hydrology-salinity-vegetation model known as MANTRA was developed by coupling a spatially explicit model (MANHAM) for simulation of vegetation community dynamics along coastal salinity gradients with SUTRA, a USGS groundwater flow and transport model. MANTRA has been used to project possible future changes in Coot Bay Hammock in southern Florida under conditions of gradually rising sea level and storm surges. The simulation study concluded that feasibility exists of a regime shift from hardwood hammocks to mangroves subject to a few conditions, namely severe damage to the existing hammock after a storm surge and a sufficiently persistent high salinity condition and high input of mangrove seedlings. Early detection of salinity stress in vegetation may facilitate sustainable conservation measures being applied. It has been shown that the delta O-18 value of water in the xylem of trees can be used as a surrogate for salinity in the rooting zone of plants, which is difficult to measure directly. Hence, the model MANTRA is revised into MANTRA-O18 by including the delta O-18 of the tree xylem dynamics. A simulation study by MANTRA-O18 shows that effects of increasing salinization can be detected many years before the salinity-intolerant trees are threatened with replacement.",2018,,25TH SALT WATER INTRUSION MEETING (SWIM 2018),54,,,WOS:000468040400039,10.1051/e3sconf/20185400039,,#18042,Teh 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20185400039,Florida,,,,
Development of a groundwater quality index for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Tomaszkiewicz, M; Abou Najm, M; El-Fadel, M","Coastal aquifers are increasingly threatened by seawater intrusion due to increased urbanization, groundwater exploitation, and global sea-level rise. Pattern diagrams, which constitute the outcome of several hydro-geochemical processes, have traditionally been used to characterize vulnerability to seawater intrusion. However, the formats of such diagrams do not facilitate the geospatial analysis of groundwater quality, thus limiting the ability of spatio-temporal mapping and monitoring. This raises the need to transform the information from current pattern diagrams into a format that can be readily used under a GIS framework to define vulnerable areas prone to seawater intrusion. In this study, a groundwater quality index specific to seawater intrusion (GQI(SWI)) was developed for the purpose of aggregating data into a comprehensible format that allows spatial analysis. The index was evaluated with data from various coastal regions worldwide and then applied at a pilot karstic aquifer along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Influences on coastal tourism demand and substitution behaviors from climate change impacts and hazard recovery responses,"Seekamp, E; Jurjonas, M; Bitsura-Meszaros, K","Climate change impacts can negatively affect tourism demand and, subsequently, local economies by disrupting access and altering physical conditions, including those from adaptation and recovery efforts. Research is needed that helps destinations become more climate ready, including studies of decision factors that influence trip-taking behaviors. This paper presents findings from a discrete choice experiment to determine how physical and economic changes could affect visitation behaviors to a vulnerable coastal destination, the Outer Banks region of North Carolina, USA. We embedded our experiment within an on-site visitor survey to reveal thresholds of negative changes to coastal attributes that tourists are willing to tolerate, and also examined tourists' willingness to substitute their future trips to the region. Transportation-related changes had the highest relative importance among the four selected attributes. The likelihood of three types of spatial substitution, spurred by not being able to access the destination, were consistently related to residency but less consistently related to place meanings, visitation history, and other demographic variables.

Individual-based modeling of flooding and salinity effects on a coastal swamp forest,"Hoeppner, SS; Rose, KA","Coastal swamps are among the rapidly vanishing wetland habitats in Louisiana. Increased flooding, nutrient and sediment deprivation, and salt-water intrusion have been implicated as probable causes of the decline of coastal swamps. We developed a two-species individual-based forest succession model to compare the growth and composition of a cypress-tupelo swamp under various combinations of flooding intensity and salinity levels, using historical time-series of stage and salinity data as inputs. Our model simulates forest succession over 500 years by representing the growth, mortality, and reproduction of individual Taxodium distichum (baldcypress) and Nyssa aquatica (water tupelo) trees in a 1-km(2) spatial grid of 1 m x 10 m cells that vary in water levels and salinity through differences in elevation. We independently adjusted the elevations of each cell to obtain different grid-wide mean elevations and standard deviations of elevation; this affected the temporal and spatial pattern of flooding. We calibrated the model by adjusting selected parameters until averaged basal area, stem density and wood production rates under two different mean elevations (partially versus highly flooded) were qualitatively similar to comparable values reported for swamps in the literature. Corroboration involved comparing model predictions to four well-monitored contrasting habitat sites within the Maurepas Basin, Louisiana, USA. Model predictions of both species combined showed the same patterns among sites as the data, but the model overestimated wood production and the dominance of T. distichum. Exploratory simulations predicted that increased flooding leads to swamps with reduced basal areas and stem densities, while increased salinity resulted in lower basal areas at low salinity concentration (similar to 1-3 psu) and complete tree mortality at higher salinity concentrations (similar to 2-6 psu). Our model can provide insight into the succession dynamics of coastal swamps and information for the effective design of restoration actions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"BALDCYPRESS (TAXODIUM-DISTICHUM (L) RICH) RESTORATION IN SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA - THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF HERBIVORY, FLOODING, COMPETITION, AND MACRONUTRIENTS","MYERS, RS; SHAFFER, GP; LLEWELLYN, DW","In the early 1900s, old-growth baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) was completely logged out of what is now the Manchac Wildlife Management Area, located in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin, Louisiana. Natural regeneration of swamp did not occur; the area is currently dominated by bulltongue (Sagittaria lancifolia) marsh. This study was conducted to isolate the major factors prohibiting cypress restoration. Specifically, four hundred baldcypress seedlings were planted in a three-way factorial treatment arrangement that included nutrient augmentation (fertilized vs. unfertilized), management of entangling vegetation (managed vs. unmanaged), herbivore protection (Tuber tree shelters, PVC sleeves, Tanglefoot), and elevation (included as a covariable). Highly significant differences in diameter growth were found for ah main effects. For the herbivore protection treatment, relatively inexpensive PVC sleeves were as effective as Tuber Tree Shelters; unprotected trees experienced 100% mortality. Seedlings that received Osmocote 18-6-12 fertilizer showed nearly a two-fold increase in diameter growth. Similarly, seedlings that were managed grew nearly two times greater in diameter than unmanaged seedlings. However, seedlings that were: unmanaged grew nearly two times greater in height than managed seedlings. This study indicates that biotic factors are primarily responsible for the lack of cypress regeneration in southeastern Louisiana, not the prevalent, but largely untested, hypothesis of salt-water intrusion.

The Coastal Hazard Wheel system for coastal multi-hazard assessment & management in a changing climate,"Appelquist, LR; Halsnaes, K","This paper presents the complete Coastal Hazard Wheel (CHW) system, developed for multi-hazard-assessment and multi-hazard-management of coastal areas worldwide under a changing climate.

The CHW constitutes a key for determining the characteristics of a particular coastline, its hazard profile and possible management options, and the system can be used for local, regional and national hazard screening and management. The system is developed to assess the main coastal hazards in a single process and covers the hazards of ecosystem disruption, gradual inundation, salt water intrusion, erosion and flooding. The system was initially presented in 2012 and based on a range of test-applications and feedback from coastal experts, the system has been further refined and developed into a complete hazard management tool. This paper therefore covers the coastal classification system used by the CHW, a standardized assessment procedure for implementation of multi-hazard-assessments, technical guidance on hazard management options and project cost examples. The paper thereby aims at providing an introduction to the use of the CHW system for assessing and managing coastal hazards.",2015,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION,19,2,157-179,WOS:000356537700005,10.1007/s11852-015-0379-7,,#18391,Appelquist 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11852-015-0379-7,,,,,
Modeling sea-level rise vulnerability of coastal environments using ranked management concerns,"Kane, HH; Fletcher, CH; Frazer, LN; Anderson, TR; Barbee, MM","Coastal erosion, salt-water intrusion, and flooding due to sea-level rise threaten to degrade critical coastal strand and wetland habitats. Because habitat loss is a measure of the risk of extinction, managers are keen for guidance to reduce risk posed by sea-level rise. Building upon standard inundation mapping techniques and suitability mapping, we develop a ranking system that models sea-level rise vulnerability as a function of six input parameters defined by wetland experts: type of inundation, time of inundation, soil type, habitat value, infrastructure, and coastal erosion. We apply this model under the mid-century and end-of-century RCP8.5 sea-level projection (0.30 m by 2057, and 0.74 m by 2100) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. To demonstrate this method, the model is applied to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and O'ahu. Each ranked input parameter is mapped upon a 2 m horizontal resolution raster and final vulnerability is obtained by calculating the weighted geometric mean of the input vulnerability scores. Areas that ranked with the 'highest' vulnerability should be the focus of future management efforts. The tools developed in this study can be a guide to prioritize conservation actions at flooded areas and initiate decisions to adaptively manage sea-level rise impacts.",2015,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,131,2,349-361,WOS:000357037700013,10.1007/s10584-015-1377-3,,#18394,Kane 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1377-3,,,,,
GLOBAL SEA-RISE: AN EARLY WARNING,"Zambo, AA","One of the most important problems facing coastal communities today is the effects of a global sea-rise on coastline habitat and infrastructure. Such a rise could inundate lowlands and wetlands, erode beaches, and exacerbate coastal flooding. Furthermore, rising sea level can influence the rate of salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers, cause expansion of the salt-water wedge in estuaries, and increase the probability of damage from storm surges along coastlines. Predicting shoreline retreat and land loss rates is critical to planning future coastal zone management strategies and assessing biological impacts due to changes in or destruction of habitat. To date long-term coastal planning has been done piecemeal, if at all (NRC, 1995). Consequently, facilities are being located and entire communities are being developed without consideration to the potential costs to relocate and/or protect them from the effects of sea-level rise, flooding, and/or loss of natural resources.An average rise in global ocean levels of just a few inches could have devastating effects on coastal towns, cities, and ecosystems worldwide. More than 100 million people live within I meter (3.28 feet) of the mean sea level (Douglas & Kearney, 2001). The problem is exceptionally urgent and serious for the low-lying small island nations of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2006 that by 2100 the sea-level could rise as much as 0.58 meters (23 inches) (Solomon et al., 2007). Current estimates of sea-level rise by 2100 range between 0.30-0.91 meters (1-3 feet). The range reflects uncertainty about global temperature projections and how rapidly ice sheets will melt or slide into the ocean in response to the warmer temperatures.Regardless of the future uncertainty, the current rate of sea-level rise is more than double the average sea-level rise seen over the past few centuries. Equally alarming is the fact that the rate of sea-level rise appears to have increased exponentially over the past few decades.",2008,,JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING,3,1,14-23,WOS:000264995000002,10.3992/jgb.3.1.14,,#18399,Zambo 2008,,,https://doi.org/10.3992/jgb.3.1.14,,,,,
Freshwater diversions as an ecosystem management tool for maintaining soil organic matter accretion in coastal marshes,"DeLaune, RD; Kongchum, M; White, JR; Jugsujinda, A",Marsh soil accretion processes were examined at 12 locations in fresh and brackish marshes in Louisiana's northern Barataria Basin estuary. Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Constraints and opportunities in planning for the wise use of natural resources in developing countries: Example of a hydropower project,"Alam, MK; Mirza, MR; Maughan, OE","The impacts of hydropower developments on local environment, ecology, and socio-economics, has influenced, and will continue to influence, the efficacy in decision making and planning/design processes. Big dams have several disadvantages: (a) high costs, (b) possible collapse, (c) evaporation loss, (d) flooding of prime agricultural land, (e) siltation of reservoir, (f) salt-water intrusion in coastal areas, (g) deforestation and 'greenhouse' effect, and (h) destruction of habitat for rare species. We must refine our environmental understanding of how hydropower development affects species, both individually and in their interactions with each other. The utter dependence of organisms on appropriate environments is what frustrates most attempts to proceed with development and still protect ecosystems and wider ecocomplexes. Conservation objectives must be integrated with other objectives in formulating national and other policies, before they crystallize into projects and programmes. When ecological factors are considered only at the end of the process, they are liable to be viewed as obstructing development, which can be disastrously wrong. But if integrated at the basic level of decision-making, they can positively guide development most propitiously and beneficially. Translated to the global context, this is best served by holistic thinking.Developing countries face severe challenges in dealing with planning, conservation, and wise use of resources. The stimulus given by hydropower developments to ecological and limnological research can provide a valuable infrastructure which can be used to promote future effective multi-objective environmental evaluation, especially in truly developing countries. Multi-objective planning must also include sociological impacts for sufficient understanding for innovative treatment of the complex interrelationships between the components of the environment. Environmentally well-designed, and meticulously carried out, integrated research should play a fundamental role as the basis of deciding for the future the renewable and sustainable needs and wise use of our often limited resources.",1995,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,22,4,352-358,WOS:A1995UG62700011,10.1017/S0376892900034925,,#18405,Alam 1995,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900034925,,,,,
Seasonal predictability of high sea level frequency using ENSO patterns along the US West Coast,"Khouakhi, A; Villarini, G; Zhang, W; Slater, LJ","High sea levels can be conducive to coastal flooding, coastal erosion and inland salt-water intrusion, and thus pose a significant threat to coastal communities, ecosystems and coastal assets. Increases in high water levels have been attributed largely to rising mean sea levels associated with intra-seasonal to interannual climate modes of variability such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we examine the predictability of the seasonal frequency of high sea levels using the Nino3.4 index. Different high sea level quantities are considered at 23 tide gauges along the U.S. West Coast, including storm surge and nuisance (minor) floods. At each site, we develop a statistical probabilistic forecasting model for seasonal high sea level frequency during the cold period of October-March. As predictors, we compare the use of (1) seasonal Nino3.4 index observations over the warm antecedent period of July-September and (2) seasonal Nino3.4 index forecasts from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) over the cold concurrent period of October-March. Results indicate that the Nino3.4 observations are a good predictor of seasonal high sea level frequency, especially for predicting the storm surge frequency. Correlation coefficients between the observed and modelled seasonal storm surge frequency range from 0.6 to 0.95 at most of the 23 tide gauges. In the predictive model, when using NMME Nino3.4 index, correlation coefficients range between approximately 0.4 and 0.7 at the southern gauges for Nino3.4 index forecasts initialized from October to June (the skill decreases with lead time). Our results provide insights into the seasonal predictability of high sea levels using ENSO patterns which is important for planning and coastal management.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,131,,,WOS:000485107000018,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.07.007,,#18407,Khouakhi 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.07.007,,,,,
Environmentally sensitive areas and indicators of desertification,"Kosmas, C; Tsara, M; Moustakas, N; Kosma, D; Yassoglou, N","Desertification is the consequence of a series of important processes in the Mediterranean environments, especially in semi-arid and and regions, where water is the main limiting factor of land use performance oil ecosystems. Among the most important processes of desertification are soil erosion and salinization particularly affecting hilly areas and lowlands, respectively. Various methodologies have been developed in identifying and mapping environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) to desertification. Studies have shown that the various types of ESAs have different behavior on crop production, plant growth, grazing capacity, and soil erosion rates. For example, olive oil and cereal production decreased as the type of ESA changes from non-threatened to critical areas. Soil erosion measures have shown that soil erosion rates increased as the sensitivity of land to desertification increased. Loss in land productivity greatly affects farmer's income and measures applied for protecting the land from further degradation and desertification.The necessity of elaborating indicators is one of the priorities identified by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The use of indicators can generally simplify complex processes and provide appropriate tools for combating desertification. Indicators can be classified to those related a) to the physical environment (soil, vegetation, climate), b) to the land management (tillage operations, irrigation practices, animal density grazing the land, forest fire protection, erosion measures, etc), and c) to the socio-economic characteristics (farmer age, family size, farm size, subsidies, farmer income, etc). Indicators can be better used for defining land desertification risk if they are classified according to the land use type. For example important indicators for defining desertification risk for vineyards are related to land management as well as to land characteristics such as tillage operations, tillage direction, slope gradient, parent material, plant cover, etc. Studies, conducted in areas in which the main process of desertification was salinization, showed that important indicators for defining desertification risk were ground water depth, drainage, water quality, frequency of flooding, distance from the seashore, type of land use, rainfall, etc.",2006,,DESERTIFICATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION.

Assessing causes and identifying solutions for high groundwater levels in a highly managed irrigated region,"Deng, CD; Bailey, RT","High groundwater levels in urban and irrigated areas around the world can lead to infrastructure damage, land degradation, and crop yield reduction. Causes can include groundwater flooding due to fluvial processes, excess rainfall and irrigation, inadequate subsurface drainage, and additional sources such as injection and seepage from earthen canals and recharge ponds. The principal causes of shallow water tables, however, are difficult to quantify due to the inter-connectedness of all possible causes. This paper presents a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in highly managed, irrigated stream-aquifer systems, using a combination of numerical groundwater flow modeling and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) tools. A tested MODFLOW groundwater model and Sobol GSA methods are used to simulate and then quantify the influence of all major groundwater stresses on water table elevation for a region in northern Colorado, USA experiencing high groundwater levels, with results showing that recharge from surface water irrigation, canal seepage, and groundwater pumping have the strongest influence on water table elevation, whereas precipitation recharge and recharge from groundwater irrigation have small influences. Time series sensitivity plots quantify the seasonality of these influences over a decadal period, and spatial sensitivity plots indicate regions that are strongly influenced by individual stresses. Results from best management practice (BMP) implementation indicate that limiting canal seepage and transitioning > 50 % of cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1.5m-3m over a 5-year period, leading to beneficial conditions for crop growth in the root zone and dewatering of subsurface infrastructure. These methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide. However, proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local, state, or national water law.",2020,,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,240,,,WOS:000546646400030,10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106329,,#18657,Deng 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106329,Colorado,USA,,,
Improving salt leaching efficiency of subsurface drainage systems using low-permeability surface mulch,"Zhang, JX; Werner, AD; Lu, CH","Surface ponding is often used in combination with subsurface drainage systems to leach excessive salts from the saline soils of reclaimed coastal areas. However, soils that are not immediately proximal to subsurface drains are typically subjected to reduced leaching efficiency (LE). This study evaluates an approach for increasing the LE through the use of a low-permeability surface mulch (LPSM) above the drain. Sand tank experiments and 2D numerical simulations were conducted to examine the effectiveness of LPSM configurations under continuous surface flooding. The results show that the addition of a LPSM leads to more spatially uniform, accelerated salt leaching towards subsurface drains. As a result, base case leaching periods and freshwater application rates were reduced by up to-60% and-80%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis based on field-scale models revealed optimal values (i.e., leading to maximum LE) of the LPSM hydraulic conductivity and length. Moreover, an approximate method is applied to estimate the leaching period, and to thereby assist in the design of drainageLPSM schemes. We conclude that the addition of a LPSM is an effective strategy to enhance salt leaching under surface ponding, adding to existing methods for ameliorating saline soils.",2022,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,162,,,WOS:000788071600001,10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104147,,#18661,Zhang 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104147,LE,,,,
Changes in plant communities of low-salinity tidal marshes in response to sea-level rise,"Humphreys, A; Gorsky, AL; Bilkovic, DM; Chambers, RM","As sea-level rises, low-salinity tidal marshes experience greater flooding with more saline water. In the Chesapeake Bay estuary, we compared the 1980 and 2014 tidal marsh inventories (TMIs) of plant communities from James City County, Virginia, USA, with respect to the spatial distribution of two species-the invasive reed Phragmites australis and native salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora-plus overall species richness. Since the 1980 TMI, the total area of low-salinity tidal marshes in which P. australis occurred increased from 0.46 km(2) to 6.30 km(2) in 2014. Between TMIs, however, the total area of low-salinity marshes occupied by S. alterniflora increased by only 0.02 km(2). Species richness in low-salinity tidal marshes decreased from 41 to 25 between TMIs. To assess seedling emergence under increased flooding and salinity, we completed two seed bank germination experiments using soil samples collected from six low-salinity marshes containing established P. australis stands. In the first experiment, more seedlings emerged in the two low-salinity (0 vs. 5 ppt) treatments after seven weeks, irrespective of flooding (water 3.75 cm below vs. at soil surface), but no P. australis or S. alterniflora germinated. For the second experiment, we added seeds of P. australis and S. alterniflora to soils exposed to the same flooding and salinity treatments to test the impact of these plant competitors on seedling emergence. No difference in number of seedlings was detected among treatments, but the number of species and their relative abundance was significantly affected by flooding (ANOSIM, R = 0.138, P < 0.001). The presence of P. australis and S. alterniflora seedlings appeared to shift the physical factor more influential on seedling emergence from salinity to flooding. For both seed bank experiments, more seedlings but not more species emerged from soils collected from marshes where P. australis coverage was P. australis and S. alterniflora-a trend expected to continue here and in other riverine estuaries of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.",2021,,ECOSPHERE,12,7,,WOS:000678730500014,10.1002/ecs2.3630,,#18752,Humphreys 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3630,James City County,Virginia,USA,,
Incorporating Groundwater Levels into Sea-Level Detection Models for Hawaiian Anchialine Pool Ecosystems,"Marrack, L","As sea levels rise, the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems are expected to change. In many coastal aquifers, fresher groundwater floats on top of denser saltwater and will rise with sea level. Under these conditions, ecosystems dependent on groundwater may shift inland as a result of inundation, changes in salinity, or both. Groundwater-fed anchialine pool habitats existing in porous coastal substrates around the world have not been assessed for sea-level rise impacts. As a first step toward examining ecosystem response to rising water levels, geospatial models were developed to detect anchialine pools on the island of Hawai'i at current water levels and models were validated with known pool locations. Specifically, the objectives were to determine whether accounting for groundwater levels in the model improved pool detection, to identify the model that most accurately detected known pools, and to identify which pool features make some pools more likely to be detected than others. Six water level models were validated with the test data set of actual pool locations to determine how well they detected known anchialine pools. Water surface models that included groundwater levels were up to 37% better at detecting anchialine pools than corresponding models without groundwater levels. The model that included groundwater levels at mean higher high water was applied to 42 km of coastline where it correctly detected 62% of known pools. A generalized linear model showed that pools with surface areas greater than 5 m(2) and pools without canopy were the most likely to be detected. Future predictive modeling of anchialine pool response to sea-level rise should include groundwater levels. Furthermore, geospatial models aimed at predicting ecosystem shifts due to sea level rise may be improved by including groundwater as a factor and should be validated using current ecosystem conditions.",2015,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,31,5,1170-1182,WOS:000360936200013,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00043.1,,#18757,Marrack 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00043.1,,,,,
"Will inundation and salinity levels associated with projected sea level rise reduce the survival, growth, and reproductive capacity of Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed)?","Woo, I; Takekawa, JY","In the San Francisco Bay Estuary, CA, USA, sea level rise (SLR) is projected to increase by 1.4 m during the next 90 years resulting in increased inundation and salt water intrusion up-estuary. Since inundation and salinity are critical factors that drive vegetation structure and composition in coastal wetlands, we asked whether inundation and salinity levels associated with SLR would reduce the survival, growth, and reproductive capacity of a dominant halophyte, Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed). We conducted a 4 x 4 factorial greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of a range of inundation periods (25, 50, 75, and 100%) and water salinities (0, 10, 20, 30 psu) on individual S. pacifica adults and seedlings. We found that inundation and salinity treatments affected the height of adults and seedlings combined. When examined separately, adult height was negatively affected by inundation >= 75%, while seedling height was affected by the interaction of both inundation and salinity. Adult belowground biomass was negatively affected by complete inundation. Seedling aboveground biomass decreased 46% at the highest salinity (30 psu) and belowground biomass decreased at salinities >= 20 psu. Adult flower production was not affected by treatments but was reduced by 38% at 30 psu salinity for seedlings. While adult survival was 99%, seedling survival was 56% with greatest mortality at low (25%) inundation, possibly because their roots were more susceptible to desiccation. Vegetation structure of the marsh platform comprised of S. pacifica adults will be susceptible to greater inundation rates associated with SLR. Our results suggest that adults may grow less tall, thus altering the vegetation structure and likely the tidal marsh wildlife that rely on these habitats.

Saltwater Transport under the Influence of Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Multilayered Aquifers,"Guo, QN; Zhang, YH; Zhou, ZF; Zhao, Y","The dynamic behavior of groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal multilayered aquifers is affected by sea-level rise (SLR). Two sets of laboratory experiments were completed that took into account SLR (seawater rising from 85 to 105 cm for scenario 1 and inland head decreasing from 100 to 80 cm for scenario 2). Groundwater flow and salt transport in the multilayered aquifers were observed during the experiment. SEAWAT software was used to validate the processes of seawater transport in the coastal multilayered aquifer under the influence of SLR. The hydrogeological parameters were identified by fitting the observed values of groundwater level and salinity in the model. The influences of aquifer heterogeneity, SLR, and boundary condition on solute mixing of saltwater and freshwater were described. Results showed that the transient toe penetration x(toe) and area of the seawater wedge increased initially and then tended to stabilize as the seawater level increased in each stage of both scenarios. The spreading rate of the seawater wedge during the process of releasing water in scenario 2 was faster than that of storing water in scenario 1, although the difference between sea level and inland boundary head was the same in the two scenarios. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated parameters were reasonable. Moreover, the variation of the seawater wedge could not be reproduced well when the hydraulic conductivities and saltwater density of the upper and lower layers were increased or decreased. The analysis provided insights into how SLR and inland water head influence seawater intrusion rate and area.",2020,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,36,5,1040-1049,WOS:000571455700012,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00189.1,,#18817,Guo 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00189.1,,,,,
Water salinity and inundation control soil carbon decomposition during salt marsh restoration: An incubation experiment,"Wang, FM; Kroeger, KD; Gonneea, ME; Pohlman, JW; Tang, JW","Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.",2019,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,9,4,1911-1921,WOS:000461114900029,10.1002/ece3.4884,,#18833,Wang 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4884,,,,,
Defining estuarine squeeze: The loss of upper estuarine transitional zones against in-channel barriers through saline intrusion,"Little, S; Lewis, JP; Pietkiewicz, H","Here we define, for the first time, the concept of estuarine squeeze and lay out recommendations for the consistent use of terminology for this new but critical research area. Climate and catchment-driven reductions in river flow together with rising sea levels are increasing estuarine salinities and driving saltwater into upper estuarine zones. This saline intrusion is exacerbated in regions where land level is falling (i.e. relative sea level rise) and in catchments subject to high freshwater demand and water regulation, which reduces river flow. In unmodified systems, many estuaries would naturally migrate inland in response to sea level rise. However, es-tuaries are some of the most anthropogenically impacted ecosystems in the world, being settlement and devel-opment hubs due to the ecosystem services they provide. To protect these assets, many estuaries have man-made in-channel barriers (such as dams, weirs and sluices) at their inland tidal limits, a trend that is likely to continue in the future to protect against the impacts of climate change. As sea levels rise and river flows reduce, saltwater will move further inland. This increasing saline intrusion will be most detrimental for upper estuarine, low salinity (oligohaline) and tidal freshwater zones, which will progressively become 'squeezed out' against these barriers. We have termed this concept 'estuarine squeeze' and define this as 'the progressive loss of extent of upper estuarine tidal freshwater and oligohaline zones against in-channel man-made barriers through saline intrusion and increasing salinities driven by relative sea level rise and/or reductions in river flow'. A lack of research into the structure and functioning of tidal freshwater zones in particular means that the impact of their reduction and/or loss on the wider estuary is unknown. However, there are indications that these zones may play a key role in estuarine biogeochemical cycling, habitat provision, primary and secondary production, food-web functioning, and the provision of trophic subsidies to the brackish estuary and coastal zone. Loss and/or reduction of these zones through estuarine squeeze may therefore result in a net loss of function, with critical implications for the ability of estuaries to continue to provide key ecosystem services into the future.",2022,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,278,,,WOS:000880382200002,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108107,,#18857,Little 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108107,,,,,
Responses of estuarine salinity and transport processes to potential future sea-level rise in the Chesapeake Bay,"Hong, B; Shen, J","Understanding the changes of hydrodynamics in estuaries with respect to magnitudes of sea-level rise is important to understanding the changes of biogeochemical processes that are coupled tightly with the physical processes. Based on the 21st century sea-level rise scenarios projected by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), the Chesapeake Bay was chosen as a prototype to study the responses of the estuary to potential future sea-level rise. The numerical model results show that the average salt content, salt intrusion length, and stratification will increase as sea level rises. The changes of these parameters have obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations. Both the salt content and stratification show more increase in spring (following the high-flow periods) and wet years than in autumn (following the low-flow periods) and dry years. The salt intrusion length has larger increase and greater standard deviation in autumn than in spring. The transport time scales are used to illustrate the variations of transport processes as sea level rises, and results indicate that (1) the exchange flow would be strengthened but the downstream transport of fresh water would be slower; (2) the residence time of the Bay would increase due to the increased volume and change of circulation; (3) the vertical transport time (reference to water surface) has more pronounced increase and the volume of water mass with different age groups increases with different rates. As a result, the retention time of dissolved substances in the Bay would increase. Although the increased tidal currents would strengthen the vertical mixing, the increased stratification would weaken the vertical exchange. The increase of vertical transport time is due to the impact of stratification changes, which overwhelms the impact of tidal changes. As the bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) supply is predominated by the vertical exchanges in the Chesapeake Bay, the increased upstream transport time has a weak impact on hypoxia conditions in the middle and upper portions of the Bay. The weakened vertical exchange would result in less DO supply from the surface to the bottom layer.

Projected sea-level rise (SLR) is expected to cause shoreline erosion, saline intrusion into the water table and inundation and flooding of beaches and coastal areas. Areas most vulnerable to these physical impacts include small, tropical low- lying islands, which are often key habitat for threatened and endemic species, such as sea turtles.2. Successful conservation of threatened species relies upon the ability of managers to understand current threats and to quantify and mitigate future threats to these species. This study investigated how sea-level rise might affect key rookeries (nesting grounds) (n=8) for the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR) green turtle population, the largest green turtle population in the world.3. 3-D elevation models were developed and applied to three SLR scenarios projected by the IPCC 2007 and an additional scenario that incorporates ice melting. Results indicate that up to 38% of available nesting area across all the rookeries may be inundated as a result of SLR.4. Flooding, as a result of higher wave run-up during storms, will increase egg mortality at these rookeries affecting the overall reproductive success of the nGBR green turtle population. Information provided will aid managers to prioritize conservation efforts and to use realistic measures to mitigate potential SLR threats to the nGBR green turtle population.

"Hydrodynamic modeling and analysis of sea-level rise impacts on salinity for oyster growth in Apalachicola Bay, Florida","Huang, WR; Hagen, S; Bacopoulos, P; Wang, DB","In this study, a previously calibrated hydrodynamic model was applied to investigate the impacts of sea level rise on salinity variations and oyster growth in Apalachicola Bay. With available observed data (winds, tides, and river flow), a case study has been conducted for the period of June 10 July 9, 2005. In addition, sea level rise impacts under a range of river flow conditions have also been examined, which include minimum monthly flow, average monthly flow, and maximum monthly flow based on the flow data from 1977 to 2013. Referring to the case study conditions under the existing sea level, model simulations were conducted to examine salinity changes in the bay in response to the sea level rise scenarios of 0.31 m, 0.5 m and 1.0 m. SLR-induced saline water intrusion mainly enters the estuary from the large opening in the east boundary. Based on the optimal salinity range for oyster growth (20-25 at Cat Point and 17-26 at Dry Bar) in Apalachicola Bay, SLR impacts were evaluated based on the model predicted salinity at Dry Bay and Cat Point. Results indicate that sea level rise results in stronger impacts on Cat Point than Dry Bar. Under the flow conditions of average monthly flow and the observed daily flow during June 10 July 9, mean salinity at Dry Bar varies within 21-24 in the optimal salinity range under 031 m and 0.5 m SLR conditions; and further increase above 26.0 when SLR is equal to 1.0 m. Under the conditions of average monthly flow and the observed daily flow during June 10 July 9, the mean salinity at Cat Point is within the optimal range under existing sea level, and increases above the maximum optimal salinity of 27 under the SLR scenarios of 0.31 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m, respectively. Extreme low and high flow conditions have also been investigated to examine the combined effects of flow and SLR. At the same sea level rise conditions, salinity under minimum flow is much higher than those under average flow, while salinity under maximum flow is much lower than those under the average flow condition.

Modeling Salinity Response to Relative Sea Level Rise in a Brackish Floodplain Region,"Miller, RL","A model-based assessment of the response of mean salinities to relative sea level rise (RSLR) in a brackish floodplain region is presented. The study area is located on the Gulf coastal region of Louisiana which is experiencing some of the highest rates of relative sea level rise in the world. A two-dimensional modeling approach is developed, and the local hydrodynamic model is well calibrated for scenario testing purposes. Numerous alternative scenarios of RSLR are evaluated to simulate the salinity response in both the open water and adjacent floodplain areas under a range of wetland roughness and dispersion factors. The analysis reveals key insights on the mean salinity response patterns to RSLR including the sensitivity to deterioration of wetlands and offshore boundary conditions. Also developed are expressions describing the qualitative nonlinear response. A novel partitioning strategy is also employed in the simulation trials to analyze the effect of various accretion deficit scenarios on the nonlinear RSLR-induced salinity response. The analysis shows that the fraction of the floodplain which is able to keep pace with RSLR has an effect an order of magnitude larger than transport parameters associated with marsh deterioration on the RSLR salinity response. Sites exhibiting sustained accretion surpluses over the long term are able to keep pace and would likely contribute to greater overall resilience to future RSLR-induced salinity changes. The robust scenario analysis and findings of this study are widely applicable to the global challenge of managing the effects of RSLR in coastal wetland areas.",2022,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,45,5,1270-1286,WOS:000718760600001,10.1007/s12237-021-01025-x,,#18929,Miller 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-021-01025-x,Louisiana,,,,
"Compound Inundation Impacts of Coastal Climate Change: Sea-Level Rise, Groundwater Rise, and Coastal Precipitation","Rahimi, R; Tavakol-Davani, H; Graves, C; Gomez, A; Valipour, MF","The importance of considering the compound effects of multiple hazards has increased in recent years due to their catastrophic impacts on human lives and property. Compound effects correspond to events with multiple concurrent or consecutive drivers, e.g., heavy storms, coastal flooding, high tides, and sea level rise (SLR). There is a recent evidence on inundation caused by SLR-driven groundwater rise, and there is a distinct knowledge gap in understanding the compound inundation effects of this phenomenon considering the important hydrologic and hydraulic considerations under compound events. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a novel analytical framework to understand the movements of the surface flow under typical precipitation events considering their interaction with uprising groundwater and SLR in a coastal watershed located in Oakland Flatlands, CA, USA, home to several disadvantaged communities. This modelling approach simulates the dynamics of compound flooding in two dimensions of the earth surface in a fine resolution, which is critical for devising proper flood management strategies. The reason to focus on disadvantaged coastal communities is that such communities typically encounter disproportionate environmental injustices due to the lack of sufficient drainage capacity in their infrastructure. Our results show that by considering the compound effect of SLR, groundwater inundation and precipitation flooding, the drainage capacity of infrastructure will be substantially exceeded, such that over 700 acres of the built infrastructure could be flooded. This is a considerable increase compared to scenarios that do not consider compound effect, or scenarios that consider inappropriate combinations of driving factors. In sum, our results highlight the significance of considering compound effects in the coastal inundation analyses, with a particular emphasis on the role of groundwater rise.",2020,,WATER,12,10,,WOS:000586177400001,10.3390/w12102776,,#18934,Rahimi 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/w12102776,Oakland Flatlands,CA,USA,,
Sea Level Rise Impacts on Wastewater Treatment Systems Along the US Coasts,"Hummel, MA; Berry, MS; Stacey, MT","As sea levels rise, coastal communities will experience more frequent and persistent nuisance flooding, and some low-lying areas may be permanently inundated. Critical components of lifeline infrastructure networks in these areas are also at risk of flooding, which could cause significant service disruptions that extend beyond the flooded zone. Thus, identifying critical infrastructure components that are exposed to sea level rise is an important first step in developing targeted investment in protective actions and enhancing the overall resilience of coastal communities. Wastewater treatment plants are typically located at low elevations near the coastline to minimize the cost of collecting consumed water and discharging treated effluent, which makes them particularly susceptible to coastal flooding. For this analysis, we used geographic information systems to assess the exposure of wastewater infrastructure to various sea level rise projections at the national level. We then estimated the number of people who would lose wastewater services, which could be more than five times as high as previous predictions of the number of people at risk of direct flooding due to sea level rise. We also performed a regional comparison of wastewater exposure to marine and groundwater flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area. Overall, this analysis highlights the widespread exposure of wastewater infrastructure in the United States and demonstrates that local disruptions to infrastructure networks may have far-ranging impacts on areas that do not experience direct flooding.Plain Language Summary Wastewater treatment plants are susceptible to flooding resulting from sea level rise. Previous estimates of wastewater exposure have only considered the impacts of marine flooding at the local or regional scale. In this analysis, we quantify the exposure to marine flooding across the coastal United States and then consider the relative impacts of marine and groundwater flooding at the regional scale in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also estimate the number of people who may lose access to wastewater services if no actions are taken to prevent flooding at wastewater treatment plants. We find that the number of people impacted by sea level rise due to loss of wastewater services could be five times as high as previous predictions of the number of people who experience direct flooding of their homes or property. We also find that groundwater flooding poses a significant threat to wastewater plants in the San Francisco Bay region.",2018,,EARTHS FUTURE,6,4,622-633,WOS:000431986000002,10.1002/2017EF000805,,#18945,Hummel 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2017EF000805,the United States,United States,,,
Effect of seawater intrusion on formation of bromine-containing trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during chlorination,"Ged, EC; Boyer, TH","This study quantified the formation and speciation of halogenated organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during chlorination as a function of seawater intrusion by spiking fresh groundwater with 0.1% to 2% seawater by volume. The four chlorine- and bromine-containing trihalomethanes (THM4) and the nine chlorine- and bromine-containing haloacetic acids (HAA9) were the DBPs investigated. The bromide concentration increased from 38 mu g L-1 in fresh groundwater to 974 ug L-1 in 2% seawater, and upon chlorination the concentration of THM4 increased from 43 to 206 pg L-1 and the concentration of HAA9 increased from 39 to 75 pig L-1. At 0.4% seawater and higher the THM4 concentration exceeded the U.S. EPA maximum contaminant level of 80 pg L-1. Although the mass concentration of HAA9 increased by nearly a factor of 2 over the seawater range of 0% to 2%, the mass concentration of the five regulated HAAs (i.e., HAA5) remained approximately constant. This is because HAA5 excludes four bromine-containing species. The increase in mass concentrations of THM4 and HAA9 with increasing seawater intrusion was the result of an increased molar formation of DBP species and a shift from chlorinated species to brominated species.

An assessment of seawater intrusion overshoot using physical and numerical modeling,"Morgan, LK; Stoeckl, L; Werner, AD; Post, VEA","In recent years, a number of numerical modeling studies of transient sea-level rise (SLR) and seawater intrusion (SWI) in flux-controlled systems have reported an overshoot phenomenon, whereby the freshwater-saltwater interface temporarily extends further inland than the eventual steady state position. In this study, we have carried out physical sand tank modeling of SLR-SWI in a flux-controlled unconfined aquifer setting to test if SWI overshoot is a measurable physical process. Photographs of the physical SLR experiments show, for the first time, that an overshoot occurs under controlled laboratory conditions. A sea-level drop (SLD) experiment was also carried out, and overshoot was again observed, whereby the interface was temporarily closer to the coast than the eventual steady state position. This shows that an overshoot can occur for the case of a retreating interface. Numerical modeling corroborated the physical SLR and SLD experiments. The magnitude of the overshoot for SLR and SLD in the physical experiments was 24% of the change in steady state interface position, albeit the laboratory setting is designed to maximize overshoot extent by adopting high groundwater flow gradients and large and rapid sea-level changes. While the likelihood of overshoot at the field scale appears to be low, this work has shown that it can be observed under controlled laboratory conditions.",2013,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,49,10,6522-6526,WOS:000327432500027,10.1002/wrcr.20526,,#19017,Morgan 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/wrcr.20526,,,,,
Accelerated microbial organic matter mineralization following salt-water intrusion into tidal freshwater marsh soils,"Weston, NB; Vile, MA; Neubauer, SC; Velinsky, DJ","The impact of salt-water intrusion on microbial organic carbon (C) mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) soils was investigated in a year-long laboratory experiment in which intact soils were exposed to a simulated tidal cycle of freshwater or dilute salt-water. Gas fluxes [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)], rates of microbial processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis), and porewater and solid phase biogeochemistry were measured throughout the experiment. Flux rates of CO2 and, surprisingly, CH4 increased significantly following salt-water intrusion, and remained elevated relative to freshwater cores for 6 and 5 months, respectively. Following salt-water intrusion, rates of sulfate reduction increased significantly and remained higher than rates in the freshwater controls throughout the experiment. Rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were higher than rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but the rates did not differ by salinity treatment. Soil organic C content decreased significantly in soils experiencing salt-water intrusion. Estimates of total organic C mineralized in freshwater and salt-water amended soils over the 1-year experiment using gas flux measurements (18.2 and 24.9 mol C m(-2), respectively) were similar to estimates obtained from microbial rates (37.8 and 56.2 mol C m(-2), respectively), and to losses in soil organic C content (0 and 44.1 mol C m(-2), respectively). These findings indicate that salt-water intrusion stimulates microbial decomposition, accelerates the loss of organic C from TFM soils, and may put TFMs at risk of permanent inundation.",2011,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,102,1-3,135-151,WOS:000285359000009,10.1007/s10533-010-9427-4,,#19026,Weston 2011,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-010-9427-4,,,,,
The paleo-ecological application of mollusks in the calculation of saltwater encroachment and resultant changes in depositional patterns driven by the Anthropocene Marine Transgression,"Meeder, JF; Adelgren, N; Stoffella, SL; Ross, MS; Kadko, DC","Numerous studies address changes in wetland deposition in response to saltwater encroachment driven by the accelerating rate of sea-level rise, by quantifying temporal changes recovered from a vertical sediment sequence. This is the first landscape scale study, based upon 10 core transects representing the heterogeneity of the Southeast Saline Everglades, Florida. By utilizing the known salinity preferences of molluscan assemblages, a Salinity Index was calculated for each core sequence and the recorded salinity changes identified and dated. Radiometric dating utilizing the Pb-210 method provides the rate of sediment accumulation and the date of changes identified in the core. The core transects provide the basis for calculation of the rate of saltwater encroachment by comparing the date of saltwater encroachment and the distance between two cores. Thereby, temporal and spatial changes in other sediment parameters in a landscape can also be quantified, such as organic carbon. This paleo-ecological approach to rapidly changing coastal conditions can be utilized to provide scientists and land managers with a record of the past, rate of changing conditions and provide the basis for predicting the future trajectory of their site. Application of this paleo-ecological approach documented increasing rates of saltwater encroachment associated with accelerating rate of sea-level rise: an average rate of 49.1 between 1895 and 1940, 69.2 between 1940 and 1968, 73 between 1968 and 1995 and 131.1 m/yr between 1995 and 2015. Approximately 1.79 km of saltwater encroachment has occurred since 1995, with three partial reversals because of increased freshwater delivery. Associated with saltwater encroachment are changes in sediment organic carbon, decreasing area of marl production and increasing distribution of mangrove. Although the distance of saltwater encroachment is greater in Florida Bay, both changes in sediment organic carbon and mangrove distribution are much less than in Biscayne Bay coastal basins. This heterogeneity is likely the result of differences in tidal ingress efficiency. At the present rate of saltwater encroachment, the freshwater wetlands are predictably lost within a century.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10,,,WOS:000868230200001,10.3389/fevo.2022.908557,,#19050,Meeder 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.908557,Florida,,,,
Growth stress response to sea level rise in species with contrasting functional traits: A case study in tidal freshwater forested wetlands,"Zhai, L; Krauss, KW; Liu, X; Duberstein, JA; Conner, WH; DeAngelis, DL; Sternberg, LDSL","With rising sea levels, mortality of glycophytes can be caused by water and nutrient stress under increasing salinity. However, the relative effects of these two stressors may vary by species-specific functional traits. For example, deciduous species, with leaves typically emerging during low salinity periods of the year, may suffer less from water stress than evergreen species. We sampled two woody species with contrasting functional traits: the evergreen and N-2-fixing waxmyrtle (Morella cerifera), and the deciduous and non-N-2 fixing baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along a coastal river (South Carolina, USA) showing an increasing pattern of plant mortality along a salinity gradient. We first analyzed oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of plant stem water and river water to determine changes in plant source water at different sites. Then we analyzed foliar carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) along with nitrogen and phosphorus content (%N and %P) as proxies for the water and nutrient stress. Results showed that: (1) the two species had different water sources at the higher salinity sites; (2) foliar delta N-15 values of baldcypress decreased with higher salinity while retaining a constant delta C-13 value, and both of these isotope values were positively related with foliar %P, suggesting greater nutrient stress but minor water stress under high salinity; and (3) foliar delta C-13 values of waxmyrtle increased with higher salinity while retaining a constant foliar delta N-15 value, and neither of the values was significantly related to foliar nutrients, suggesting greater water stress but minor nutrient stress under high salinity. The different responses of the two species to high salinity may be related to their differences in leaf phenology and N-2-fixation. Our results suggest that nutrient stress, particularly of P, can contribute to stress and eventual high mortality of baldcypress exposed to salt water intrusion.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,155,,378-386,WOS:000446289500036,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.07.023,,#19080,Zhai 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.07.023,South Carolina,USA,,,
Study on the influence of seawater density variation on sea water intrusion in confined coastal aquifers,"Na, J; Chi, BM; Zhang, Y; Li, JL; Jiang, X","The coupled influence of seawater density and groundwater level variation plays an import role in seawater intrusion in confined coastal aquifers. In this study, the effects of seawater density variations along with changing hydraulic gradients were investigated by conducting laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Parameters of salinty and density in the experiments are based on the references related Bohai sea of China. The results indicate that the higher density of saltwater facilitates the seawater intrusion into the aquifers at the bottom and accelerates the circulation at the changing hydraulic gradient. Even slight variations in saltwater density can change the steady-state conditions in a confined aquifer, which should be considered when attempting to control the intrusion of seawater. Moreover, the influence of seawater density variations on transient salt-wedge dynamics was also examined in these experiments. Numerical modelling was simultaneously performed to mimic the behaviour of SW using the TOUGH2/EOS7 package. The simulated results were generally consistent with those obtained from the experiments.

"Sea-level rise and coastal groundwater inundation and shoaling at select sites in California, USA","Hoover, DJ; Odigie, KO; Swarzenski, PW; Barnard, P","Study region: The study region spans coastal California, USA, and focuses on three primary sites: Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon.Study focus: 1m and 2m sea-level rise (SLR) projections were used to assess vulnerability to SLR-driven groundwater emergence and shoaling at select low-lying, coastal sites in California. Separate and combined inundation scenarios for SLR and groundwater emergence were developed using digital elevation models of study site topography and groundwater surfaces constructed from well data or published groundwater level contours.New hydrological insights for the region: SLR impacts are a serious concern in coastal California which has a long (1800 km) and populous coastline. Information on the possible importance of SLR-driven groundwater inundation in California is limited. In this study, the potential for SLR-driven groundwater inundation at three sites (Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon) was investigated under 1 m and 2 m SLR scenarios. These sites provide insight into the vulnerability of Northern California coastal plains, coastal developments built on beach sand or sand spits, and developed areas around coastal lagoons associated with seasonal streams and berms. Northern California coastal plains with abundant shallow groundwater likely will see significant and widespread groundwater emergence, while impacts along the much drier central and southern California coast may be less severe due to the absence of shallow groundwater in many areas. Vulnerability analysis is hampered by the lack of data on shallow coastal aquifers, which commonly are not studied because they are not suitable for domestic or agricultural use. Shallow saline aquifers may be present in many areas along coastal California, which would dramatically increase vulnerability to SLR -driven groundwater emergence and shoaling. Improved understanding of the extent and response of California coastal aquifers to SLR will help in preparing for mitigation and adaptation.

Simulated storm surge effects on freshwater coastal wetland soil porewater salinity and extractable ammonium levels: Implications for marsh recovery after storm surge,"McKee, M; White, JR; Putnam-Duhon, LA","Coastal wetland systems experience both short-term changes in salinity, such as those caused by wind driven tides and storm surge, and long-term shifts caused by sea level rise. Salinity increases associated with storm surge are known to have significant effects on soil porewater chemistry, but there is little research on the effect of flooding length on salt penetration depth into coastal marsh soils. A simulated storm surge was imposed on intact soil columns collected from a non-vegetated mudflat and a vegetated marsh site in the Wax Lake Delta, LA. Triplicate intact cores were continuously exposed to a 35 salinity water column (practical salinity scale) for 1, 2, and 4 weeks and destructively sampled in order to measure porewater salinity and extractable NH4-N at two cm depth intervals. Salinity was significantly higher in the top 8 cm for both the marsh and mudflat cores after one week of flooding. After four weeks of flooding, salinity was significantly higher in marsh and mudflat cores compared to the control (no salinity) cores throughout the profile for both sites. Extractable ammonium levels increased significantly in the marsh cores throughout the experiment, but there was only a marginally (p < 0.1) significant increase seen in the mudflat cores. Results indicate that porewater salinity levels can become significantly elevated within a coastal marsh soil in just one week. This vertical intrusion of salt can potentially negatively impact macrophytes and associated microbial communities for significantly longer term post storm surge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Negative impacts of sea-level rise on soil microbial involvement in carbon metabolism,"Zhang, JJ; Fu, Q; Huang, Y; Fan, YX; Liang, MX; Chen, HH; Yu, SX","Sea-level rise has been threatening the terrestrial ecosystem functioning of coastal islands, of which the most important component is carbon (C) cycling. However, metagenomic and metabolomic evidence documenting salt intrusion effects on molecular biological processes of C cycling are still lacking. Here, we investigated microbial communities, metagenomic taxonomy and function, and metabolomic profiles in the marine-terrestrial transition zone of low- and high-tide, and low- and high-land areas based on distances of 0 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m, respectively, to the water-land junction of Neilingding Island. Our results showed that soil salinity (EC) was the dominant driver controlling bacterial abundance and community composition and metagenomic taxonomy and function. The metabolomic profiling at the low-tide site was significantly different from that of other sites. The low-tide site had greater abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (1.6-3.7 fold), especially Gammaproteobacteria, but lower abundance (62-83%) of Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi, compared with other three sites. The metagenomic functional genes related to carbohydrate metabolism decreased at the low-tide site by 15.2%, including the metabolism of aminosugars, di- and oligo-saccharides, glycoside hydrolases, and monosaccharides, leading to significant decreases in 21 soil metabolites, such as monosaccharide (l-gulose), disaccharide (sucrose and turanose), and oligosaccharides (stachyose and maltotetraose).

Tipping points for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers under rising sea level,"Mazi, K; Koussis, AD; Destouni, G","This study considers different projections of climate-driven sea-level rise and uses a recently developed, generalized analytical model to investigate the responses of sea intrusion in unconfined sloping coastal aquifers to climate-driven sea-level rise. The results show high nonlinearity in these responses, implying important thresholds, or tipping points, beyond which the responses of seawater intrusion to sea-level rise shift abruptly from a stable state of mild change responses to a new stable state of large responses to small changes that can rapidly lead to full seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer. The identified tipping points are of three types: (a) spatial, for the particular aquifers (sections) along a coastline with depths that imply critical risk of full sea intrusion in response to even small sea-level rise; (b) temporal, for the critical sea-level rise and its timing, beyond which the change responses and the risk of complete sea intrusion in an aquifer shift abruptly from low to very high; and (c) managerial, for the critical minimum values of groundwater discharge and hydraulic head that inland water management must maintain in an aquifer in order to avoid rapid loss of control and complete sea intrusion in response to even small sea-level rise. The existence of a tipping point depends on highly variable aquifer properties and groundwater conditions, in combination with more homogeneous sea conditions.

A significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to virtually occur and as a result, more CO2 is absorbed by surface waters, decreasing seawater pH and carbonate saturation. Sea surface temperatures are also essentially certain to rise significantly, although less than the global mean temperature rise. Globally, SLR derived from thermal expansion due to warming of oceans and the melting of ice caps, glaciers, and ice sheets (i.e., Greenland and Antarctica) act together as major factors contributing to RSLR. The rise will not be spatially uniform, with possible intensification of ENSO and time variability which suggests greater change in extremes with important implications for coral reefs. In most cases there will be significant regional variations in the changes, and any impacts will be the result of the interaction between climate change drivers (i.e., CO2 concentrations, SST, SLR, storm intensity, frequency, and track, wave conditions and runoff) and other drivers of change, leading to diverse effects and vulnerabilities. The direct influences of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal water resources are associated with seawater encroachment into surface waters and coastal aquifers. Inundation as a result of increases in mean sea level will have devastating impacts on unprotected low-lying areas, especially as a result of storm events which are expected to intensify. Seawater intrusion caused by natural and human-derived factors will be exacerbated by SLR. However, some coastal areas, especially on some arid coasts, receiving more precipitation may be less impacted by seawater intrusion as a result of increased aquifer recharge. Climate change adverse impacts on freshwater supplies at a global scale are most likely to be more visible in developing countries with large extents of coastal lowland, small island states, semi-arid and arid coasts, and large coastal cities particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting both natural and socio-economic aspects that increase the risk levels. Thus, it is difficult to identify future coastal areas with stressed freshwater resources, particularly where there is a seasonal water demand stress and poor management. Assessments of RSLR-related coastal impacts, adaptation, and mitigation, require information related to climate-induced GMSLR, regional variations, and non-climate-related sea level changes and freshwater stressors.",2016,,EMERGING ISSUES IN GROUNDWATER RESOURCES,,,1-30,WOS:000404570100002,10.1007/978-3-319-32008-3_110.1007/978-3-319-32008-3,,#19161,Murgulet 2016,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32008-3_110.1007/978-3-319-32008-3,Greenland,,,,
RECOVERY OF FRESH-WATER MARSH VEGETATION AFTER A SALTWATER INTRUSION EVENT,"FLYNN, KM; MCKEE, KL; MENDELSSOHN, IA","Greenhouse mesocosms of freshwater marsh vegetation were exposed to a simulated saltwater intrusion event followed by a recovery period during which water levels and interstitial water salinity were adjusted over a range of conditions. Virtually all above-ground vegetation, including the three dominant species, Sagittaria lancifolia L., Leersia or oryzoides (L.) Swartz, and Panicum hemitomon Schultes, was killed by the initial saltwater intrusion event. P. hemitomon did not recover, but S. lancifolia and L. oryzoides, as well as many of the other species initially present, exhibited some ability to recover depending on post-saltwater intrusion conditions. Increasingly harsh recovery conditions (for freshwater marsh vegetation), including more reduced soil conditions, higher interstitial salinities, and higher interstitial sulfide concentrations were associated with decreased live above-ground biomass and species richness. The effect of elevated salinity on vegetative recovery became more pronounced under flooded conditions. This experiment illustrates that the response of a freshwater marsh community to the longterm disturbance effect of a transient saltwater intrusion event will be strongly influenced by post-intrusion salinity and water levels.",1995,,OECOLOGIA,103,1,63-72,WOS:A1995RJ29400009,10.1007/BF00328426,,#19163,FLYNN 1995,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00328426,Leersia,,,,
Integral Analysis of Field Work and Laboratory Electrical Resistivity Imaging for Saline Water Intrusion Prediction in Groundwater,"IOP; Zawawi, MH; Zahar, MF; Hashim, MMM; Hazreek, ZAM; Zahari, NM; Kamaruddin, MA",Saline water intrusion is a serious threat to the groundwater as many part of the world utilize groundwater as their main source of fresh water supply. The usage of high salinity level of water as drinking water can lead to a very serious health hazard towards human. Saline water intrusion is a process by which induced flow of seawater into freshwater aquifer along the coastal area. It might happen due to human action and/or by natural event. The climate change and rise up of sea level may speed up the saline water intrusion process. The conventional method for distinguishing and checking saltwater interference to groundwater along the coast aquifers is to gather and test the groundwater from series of observation wells (borehole) with an end goal to give the important information about the hydrochemistry data to conclude whether the water in the well are safe to consume or not. An integrated approach of field and laboratory electrical resistivity investigation is proposed for indicating the contact region between saline and fresh groundwater. It was found that correlation for both soilbox produced almost identical curvilinear trends for 2% increment of seawater tested using sand sample. This project contributes towards predicting the saline water intrusion to the groundwater by non-destructive test that can replaced the conventional method of groundwater monitoring using series of boreholes in the coastal area,2018,,INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY 2017 (ISMAP 2017),995,,,WOS:000446795100095,10.1088/1742-6596/995/1/012095,,#19177,IOP 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/995/1/012095,,,,,
Numerical study of groundwater flow cycling controlled by seawater/freshwater interaction in Woodville Karst Plain,"Xu, ZY; Hu, BX; Xu, ZX; Wu, XJ","Seawater intrusion due to sea level rise and climate change could significantly contaminate coastal groundwater resources, particularly in Florida, the flat low-land state in the United States. Based on the field investigation and hydrological measurements, a three-dimensional SEAWAT model is developed to evaluate the groundwater flow cycling and seawater intrusion to freshwater system in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP), a typical karst groundwater system in the Floridan aquifer. The karst conduit network in the aquifer acts as fast flow pathway for groundwater flow and solute transport, so seawater could deeply intrude into the aquifer. Wakulla Spring, an inland spring 17 km from the coast and a coastal submarine spring, Spring Creek Spring Complex are connected through the conduit network. The flow direction between the two springs switches under various rainfall conditions in this region, thus the discharges at two karst springs are used to estimate the location of seawater/freshwater mixing interface. The SEAWAT modeling results indicate that the mixing interface, defined as 2 PSU (Practical Salinity Unit), intrudes 3 to 5 km through the subsurface karst conduit during the dry season and severely contaminates nearly 1 km width of groundwater around the conduit. The salinity distribution and the distance of seawater intrusion through the conduit system are very sensitive to precipitation variation and the sea level boundary condition. Furthermore, predictions are made for seawater intrusion to the aquifer under various sea level rise, precipitation scenarios and water pumping. The results show that the seawater intrusion could reach and contaminate inland freshwater systems if sea level rises 1.0 m or during a long-term no-precipitation season. This study provides insights for modeling and predicting the vulnerability of a coastal karst aquifer through the simulation of variable-density flow.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,579,,,WOS:000500371200031,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124171,,#19181,Xu 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124171,karst,Florida,the United States,,
Farming carbon: The link between saltwater intrusion and carbon storage in coastal agricultural fields,"de la Reguera, E; Tully, KL","As sea levels continue to rise, coastal agroecosystems have become more vulnerable to saltwater intrusion (SWI). Saltwater intrusion is the landward movement of sea salts, which can alter carbon (C) storage. Transitioning agricultural fields have the potential to become C sinks as SWI advances inland and turns farms to marshes. The objectives of our study were to (1) quantify the size of C pools along a salinity transect; (2) determine how soil C is occluded through levels of physical protection in soil aggregates; (3) examine relationships between indicators of SWI and soil C measures in coastal farm fields. We collected soils (to a depth of similar to 140 cm) along a transect from the edge of a salt-damaged field (high salinity and frequently inundated) to the center (low salinity and drier). We measured bulk soil C pools and the amount of C stored in large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt+clay size classes. Soil C pools were largest in the edge of field and ditch bank soils compared to the center of the field (P = 0.01). In ditch bank soils, most of the C was stored in large macroaggregates; however, in the center of the field, most C was stored in silt+clays. We suggest that frequent wetting events may lead to increased C storage along the edges of farm fields both as a result of suppressed decomposition rates and increased clay flocculation leading to macroaggregate formation. Further, a vegetation shift from annual, shallow-rooted crops to perennial, deeply rooted marsh grasses along field edges likely contributed to higher soil C levels as well as increased aggregation. An improved understanding of soil C dynamics can help inform management strategies that support farm and environmental wellbeing as our coastlines change.",2021,,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,314,,,WOS:000647427500012,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107416,,#19184,delaReguera 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107416,,,,,
Effects of Hurricane Irma on residual flows and saltwater intrusion in a subtropical estuary,"Guerra-Chanis, GE; So, SD; Valle-Levinson, A","The variability of residual flows and saltwater intrusion was evaluated for the duration of a hurricane related freshwater pulse in a subtropical estuary, the Suwannee River. Increased rainfall affected the river's watershed when Hurricane Irma skirted the west coast of Florida in September 2017. The river remained short of reaching flood stages, but the increased river discharge was enough to modify the residual circulation and restrict saltwater intrusion. Current velocity profiles and hydrographic variables were collected in five tidal-cycle experiments to study the lower estuary's response to the peak river discharge and its subsequent relaxation. Data were recorded in three cross-estuary transects. In addition, continuous salinity measurements were recorded for 48 days over the shallow portion of the seaward transect. Results showed that the subtidal water-level slope inside the estuary, between the mouth and a river station at Wilcox, modified the residual circulation and restricted the intrusion of salt water. During high tide, salt water entered the estuary due to tidal pumping even though residual circulation was seaward in the cross-section. Residual seaward flows persisted for the duration of the hurricane-related freshwater pulse. After relaxation of the freshwater pulse, saltwater intrusion was observed in the time series over the shallow portion. This saltwater intrusion responded to changes in wind forcing, with largest intrusions when the wind blew into the estuary, i.e., toward the N and NW. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Four-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging for monitoring pumping-induced saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer,"McDonnell, MC; Flynn, R; Aguila, JF; Hamill, GA; Donohue, S; Benner, EM; Thomson, C; Etsias, G; Rowan, TSL; Wilkinson, PB; Meldrum, PI","Conventional views of saltwater intrusion (SWI), where a basal saline wedge extends inland below fresh groundwater, can be complicated by the influence of saltwater cells in the upper part of aquifers in areas affected by tidal cycles. Distinguishing the contribution of each saltwater source may prove fundamental for well design and resource management. Application of time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) during a 32-h pumping test in a pristine unconfined coastal sand aquifer, affected by strong tidal ranges (>2 m), aimed to evaluate the potential of the method to characterize the source of induced SWI in four dimensions (three dimensions and time). Water level monitoring during the test revealed that at the end of pumping, the upper 2 m of the aquifer had dewatered in the vicinity of the well field, reversing hydraulic gradients between the aquifer and the sea. This induced SI, with mixing models of well head water quality suggesting that saline water contributions to total discharge rose from 4 % to 8 %. ERI results reflected dewatering through an increase in resistivity in the upper 2-6 m of the aquifer, while a decline in resistivity, relative to background conditions, occurred immediately below this, reflecting the migration of saline water through the upper layers of the aquifer to the pumping well. By contrast no change in resistivity occurred at depth, indicating no significant change in contribution from the basal saline water to discharge. Test findings suggest that future water resource development at the site should focus on close monitoring of shallow pumping, or pumping from deeper parts of the aquifer, while more generally demonstrating the value of time-lapse geophysical methods in informing coastal water resource management.",2023,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,867,,,WOS:000997523800001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161442,,#19217,McDonnell 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161442,,,,,

Differential Responses of Soil Extracellular Enzyme Activities to Salinization: Implications for Soil Carbon Cycling in Tidal Wetlands,"Yang, Y; Moorhead, DL; Craig, H; Luo, M; Chen, X; Huang, JF; Olesen, JE; Chen, J","Rising sea levels are expected to cause salinization in many historically low-salinity tidal wetlands. However, the response of soil extracellular enzyme activities to salinization in tidal wetlands and their links to soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis to examine the effect of salinization on hydrolytic and oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities and their relationships with SOC storage in tidal wetlands. The results showed that salinization reduced hydrolytic carbon-acquiring enzyme activities by 33% but increased oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities by 15%. Meanwhile, salinization decreased SOC storage by 14%, and the change in SOC storage was negatively associated with oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities. These results indicate an important role for oxidative carbon-acquiring enzymes in SOC loss in tidal wetlands. Moreover, the effect of salinization on oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities logarithmically declined with increasing salinization, implying that SOC loss was highly sensitive to even minor increases in salinity at the initial stage of salinization. Given increasing salinization over time with rising sea levels in most global tidal wetlands, our results suggest that SOC loss might be greater during early than later stages. Consequently, salinization-induced SOC loss may be overstated in the long term if extrapolations are merely based on a constant SOC loss rate determined from short-term studies. Future modeling frameworks should account for this changing sensitivity of microbially mediated SOC loss with increasing salinization over time.",2022,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,36,6,,WOS:000812036600001,10.1029/2021GB007285,,#19230,Yang 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007285,,,,,
Diatoms as tools for inferring ecotone boundaries in a coastal freshwater wetland threatened by saltwater intrusion,"Mazzei, V; Gaiser, E","Species sorting mechanisms often control community assembly patterns across environmentally heterogeneous landscapes, particularly within microbial communities that respond quickly to environmental variability and are not dispersal-limited on intermediate time scales. in this study, we describe the spatial and seasonal patterns of two key environmental drivers, porewater (PW). conductivity and total phosphorus (TP), in the southern Everglades, FL., USA where saltwater intrusion, caused by rising sea level and hydrologic management, are transforming the natural environmental gradients of this ecological stressor and limiting nutrient. We surveyed diatom assemblages along transects capturing PW conductivity and TP gradients and searched for spatial boundaries in diatom assemblages along each transect. We also determined diatom assemblage thresholds to PW conductivity and TP, and identified significant indicator taxa with either negative (declining) or positive (increasing) relationships to each driver and their individual thresholds. We demonstrate that the southern Everglades exhibits spatially-structured gradients of conductivity and P that are oriented in two dimensions (i.e., with distance from the coast and from west to east) and are often, but not always, positively correlated. Our results show that these gradients drive spatial patterns of compositional similarity among our sampling sites. We found the location of greatest dissimilarity in diatom assemblages for each transect coincided with the upper boundary of the ""white zone""-the visible ecotone between freshwater and coastal marshes. We did not detect seasonal differences in the position of the diatom-inferred ecotone as expected, nor did we detect significant differences in PW conductivity or TP between wet and dry seasons. Diatom assemblages Were highly sensitive to both PW conductivity, with freshwater indicator assemblages declining above 2 mS cm(-1) and becoming replaced by a brackish water assemblage at around 20 mS cm(-1), and periphyton TP, with thresholds at 82 and 285 pg g(-1) for negatively-and positively responding taxa, respectively. Our study highlights that small increases in PW conductivity and TP are sufficient to cause shifts in the diatom assemblages of the Everglades. As saltwater continues to encroach into this area, compositional changes in this important primary producer assemblage are expected to cascade through the ecosystem and influence the food web. The diatom indicator taxa and assemblage thresholds presented here offer a sensitive tool that should continue to be developed and applied to management strategies for saltwater intrusion while its effects can still be mitigated.",2018,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,88,,190-204,WOS:000430760800021,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.003,,#19240,Mazzei 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.003,PW,USA,,,
Projected sea level rise in Florida,"Walton, TL","Future sea level rise will lead to salt water intrusion, beach/dune recession, and many other coastal problems. This paper addresses a data based forecasting approach to provide relative sea level rise estimates at locations in Florida where historical water level data exist. Many past estimates of sea level rise have treated the rise as a linear straight line trend over the historical data set. The present paper has allowed for acceleration (or deceleration) in sea level rise to account for the possibility of anthropogenic global warming and consequent higher (than linear straight line) future sea levels similar to values noted by global climatic modelers.

Assessment of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion in sloping confined coastal aquifers,"Shi, WL; Lu, CH; Werner, AD","Previous studies of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion (SLR-SWI) are mostly based on horizontal coastal aquifers, despite that most coastal aquifers are sloping. A recent study has shown that the effect of aquifer slope can not be neglected when assessing SLR-SWI in unconfined coastal aquifers. However, the effect of slope in confined aquifers has not been evaluated. In this study, we apply existing analytical solutions to quantify the effect of the slope of both upper and lower confining layers on SLR-SWI. The results show that for flux-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, SLR does not change the steady-state interface location, consistent with previous findings for horizontal aquifers. Therefore, our analysis focuses on head-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, for which we find the assumption of horizontal confining units causes significant errors. We demonstrate this by assessing the sensitivities of the seawater toe location and seawater volume to SLR for various combinations of sloping confining layers. The results indicate that the influence of the slope on SLR-SWI is small in thin confined aquifers. However, the slope is an important factor in thick confined aquifers. The influence of the slope in the lower confining layer on SLR-SWI is much greater than that of the upper confining layer. Aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to SLR-SWI, whereas those that thin towards inland are least susceptible. The assessment of SLR-SWI in sloping confined coastal aquifers in the current study demonstrates application of a rapid, first-order assessment tool that can be applied to a wide range of other sloping coastal confined-aquifer problems.",2020,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,586,,,WOS:000544258100034,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124872,,#19285,Shi 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124872,,,,,
Modeled Tradeoffs between Developed Land Protection and Tidal Habitat Maintenance during Rising Sea Levels,"Cadol, D; Elmore, AJ; Guinn, SM; Engelhardt, KAM; Sanders, G","Tidal habitats host a diversity of species and provide hydrological services such as shoreline protection and nutrient attenuation. Accretion of sediment and biomass enables tidal marshes and swamps to grow vertically, providing a degree of resilience to rising sea levels. Even if accelerating sea level rise overcomes this vertical resilience, tidal habitats have the potential to migrate inland as they continue to occupy land that falls within the new tide range elevations. The existence of developed land inland of tidal habitats, however, may prevent this migration as efforts are often made to dyke and protect developments. To test the importance of inland migration to maintaining tidal habitat abundance under a range of potential rates of sea level rise, we developed a spatially explicit elevation tracking and habitat switching model, dubbed the Marsh Accretion and Inundation Model ( MAIM), which incorporates elevation-dependent net land surface elevation gain functions. We applied the model to the metropolitan Washington, DC region, finding that the abundance of small National Park Service units and other public open space along the tidal Potomac River system provides a refuge to which tidal habitats may retreat to maintain total habitat area even under moderate sea level rise scenarios (0.7 m and 1.1 m rise by 2100). Under a severe sea level rise scenario associated with ice sheet collapse (1.7 m by 2100) habitat area is maintained only if no development is protected from rising water. If all existing development is protected, then 5%, 10%, and 40% of the total tidal habitat area is lost by 2100 for the three sea level rise scenarios tested.",2016,,PLOS ONE,11,10,,WOS:000389604900033,10.1371/journal.pone.0164875,,#19336,Cadol 2016,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164875,"Washington, DC region",,,,
"Freshwater-saltwater transition zone movement during aquifer storage and recovery cycles in Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, USA","Misut, PE; Voss, CI","Freshwater storage in deep aquifers of Brooklyn and Queens, New York, USA, is under consideration as an emergency water supply for New York City. The purpose of a New York City storage and recovery system is to provide an emergency water supply during times of drought or other contingencies and would entail longer-term storage phases than a typical annual cycle. There is concern amongst neighboring coastal communities that such a system would adversely impact their local water supplies via increased saltwater intrusion. This analysis uses three-dimensional modeling of variable-density ground-water flow and salt transport to study conditions under which hypothetical aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) may not adversely impact the coastal water supplies. A range of storage, pause, and recovery phase lengths and ASR cycle repetitions were used to test scenarios that emphasize control of potential saltwater intrusion.The USGS SUTRA code was used to simulate movement of the freshwater-saltwater transition zones in a detailed model of the upper glacial, Jameco, Magothy, and Lloyd aquifers of western Long Island, New York. Simulated transition zones in the upper glacial, Jameco, and Magothy aquifers reach a steady state for 1999 stress and recharge conditions within 1 ka; however, saltwater encroachment is ongoing in the Lloyd (deepest) aquifer, for which the effects of the rise in sea level since deglaciation on transition zone equilibration are retarded by many ka due to the thick, overlying Raritan confining unit. Pumping in the 20th century has also caused widening and landward movement of the Lloyd aquifer transition zone. Simulation of scenarios of freshwater storage by injection followed by phases of pause and recovery by extraction indicates that the effect of net storage when less water is recovered than injected is to set up a hydraulic saltwater intrusion barrier in the Lloyd aquifer which may have beneficial effects to coastal water users.

Experimental and Numerical Analysis on Hydraulic Characteristics of Coastal Aquifers with Seawall,"Lee, WD; Yoo, YJ; Jeong, YM; Hur, DS","In this study, hydraulic model experiments were conducted to measure the saltwater-freshwater equilibrium interface in a coastal aquifer with underground obstructions such as an impermeable seawall. To analyse the hydraulic characteristics inside the coastal aquifer, numerical analysis was conducted using a non-hydrostatic Navier-Stokes solver based on the Porous Body Model (PBM), which can directly analyse groundwater flow. A unique saltwater-freshwater equilibrium interface that does not appear in typical coastal aquifer analyses was observed in a sandy tank experiment. In the experiment, the rise of the groundwater level behind the seawall increased the pressure gradient and groundwater flow rate, causing the saltwater-freshwater interface to move towards the sea and a freshwater region to form on the seabed in front of the seawall. The numerical analysis enabled close examination of the groundwater level distribution, groundwater flow, seawater-freshwater interface, and pore water pressure characteristics of the coastal aquifer with underground obstructions. The sandy tank experiment also provided an understanding of the hydraulic characteristics of groundwater in the coastal aquifer with a seawall, which previously could not be accurately analysed. The experimental and analytical results demonstrated that the rise of groundwater level due to underground obstructions in the coastal aquifer increased the pressure gradient and groundwater flow rate and slowed seawater intrusion.

Forecasting Groundwater Table in a Flood Prone Coastal City with Long Short-term Memory and Recurrent Neural Networks,"Bowes, BD; Sadler, JM; Morsy, MM; Behl, M; Goodall, JL","Many coastal cities are facing frequent flooding from storm events that are made worse by sea level rise and climate change. The groundwater table level in these low relief coastal cities is an important, but often overlooked, factor in the recurrent flooding these locations face. Infiltration of stormwater and water intrusion due to tidal forcing can cause already shallow groundwater tables to quickly rise toward the land surface. This decreases available storage which increases runoff, stormwater system loads, and flooding. Groundwater table forecasts, which could help inform the modeling and management of coastal flooding, are generally unavailable. This study explores two machine learning models, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to model and forecast groundwater table response to storm events in the flood prone coastal city of Norfolk, Virginia. To determine the effect of training data type on model accuracy, two types of datasets (i) the continuous time series and (ii) a dataset of only storm events, created from observed groundwater table, rainfall, and sea level data from 2010-2018 are used to train and test the models. Additionally, a real-time groundwater table forecasting scenario was carried out to compare the models' abilities to predict groundwater table levels given forecast rainfall and sea level as input data. When modeling the groundwater table with observed data, LSTM networks were found to have more predictive skill than RNNs (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 m versus 0.14 m, respectively). The real-time forecast scenario showed that models trained only on storm event data outperformed models trained on the continuous time series data (RMSE of 0.07 m versus 0.66 m, respectively) and that LSTM outperformed RNN models. Because models trained with the continuous time series data had much higher RMSE values, they were not suitable for predicting the groundwater table in the real-time scenario when using forecast input data. These results demonstrate the first use of LSTM networks to create hourly forecasts of groundwater table in a coastal city and show they are well suited for creating operational forecasts in real-time. As groundwater table levels increase due to sea level rise, forecasts of groundwater table will become an increasingly valuable part of coastal flood modeling and management.",2019,,WATER,11,5,,WOS:000472680400228,10.3390/w11051098,,#19365,Bowes 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/w11051098,Norfolk,Virginia,,,
Methyl chloride production by calcareous periphyton mats from the Florida Everglades,"Raffel, AE; Jones, RD; Butenhoff, C; Rice, AL; Scully, NM","Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a trace gas with natural and anthropogenic sources that plays an important role in stratospheric ozone catalytic cycles. Here, we report on research to quantify the production of CH3Cl in response to varying levels of salinity from calcareous periphyton mats found within the Florida Everglades, USA, the first measurements of their kind. Periphyton were collected from the Everglades and exposed to continuous, artificially simulated 12 h dark: 12 h light cycles, in both freshwater and varying concentrations of saltwater. Water samples were collected and analyzed to determine the resulting production rate of CH3Cl. We found that periphyton produced CH3Cl in both freshwater and all concentrations of saltwater (24 to 208 fmol CH3Cl gDW(-1) periphyton h(-1) after 24 h) and that there was a significant positive effect of salinity on the production rate of CH3Cl (r(2) = 0.993, p < 0.001). Our results indicate that rising sea levels as predicted by climate models will increase production rates of CH3Cl in coastal periphyton wetlands that could be inundated with high salinity seawater. Furthermore, other natural sources of CH3Cl may also respond through similar mechanisms to sea level rise and salt water intrusion resulting from global climate change.",2014,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,514,,35-41,WOS:000345700700003,10.3354/meps10956,,#19374,Raffel 2014,,,https://doi.org/10.3354/meps10956,USA,,,,
Transience of seawater intrusion in response to sea level rise,"Watson, TA; Werner, AD; Simmons, CT","Understanding seawater intrusion (SWI) induced by sea level rise (SLR) is important for the future management of many coastal aquifers. Only simplified steady state sharp interface analyses of generalized SLR-SWI exist in the literature, and the important issue of associated time scales has been neglected. We employ numerical modeling in order to explore the transience of dispersive SLR-SWI in common unconfined coastal aquifer settings. An instantaneous SLR is adopted to compare with the instantaneous sea level drop (SLD) case of a previous SLD-SWI analysis. Temporal asymmetry between the SWI responses to SLR and SLD is observed. A SLR-SWI simulation series indicates that toe ""representative response times"" (time to reach 95% of new steady state) range from decades to centuries for a 1 m SLR. Significant discrepancies between the representative response times of various SWI quantitative indicators (e. g., toe position, wedge center-of-mass) are observed. This demonstrates that the indication of steady state SWI conditions depends upon the monitoring approach and thus holds implications for studies reporting that SWI steady state has been attained. We adopt 100 years as a typical ""planning time frame"" and compare 100 year and steady state SLR-SWI. As expected, the simplified steady state sharp interface solution overpredicts the 100 year landward toe shift in most cases. However, some simulations exhibit temporary ""overshoot"" of the steady state interface position: this is in contradiction to the presumption that steady state SWI is the worst case. Steady state sharp interface estimates appear to be at best useful as initial approximations of SLR-SWI, given that they span 40%-250% of 100 year dispersive interface results for the cases considered.",2010,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,46,,,WOS:000285259900005,10.1029/2010WR009564,,#19391,Watson 2010,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2010WR009564,,,,,
Haline Convection within a Fresh-Saline Water Interface in a Stratified Coastal Aquifer Induced by Tide,"Ben-Zur, E; Gvirtzman, H; Shalev, E","Sea-tide effects on the fresh-saline water interface (FSI) in a stratified coastal aquifer are examined through laboratory experiments. The physical model, a two-dimensional rectangular flow tank, is filled with layered aquifers and aquitards. The aquifers serve as the main entrances/exits of water to/from the system through significant horizontal flows, creating unstable conditions of heavier saline water above lighter freshwater for short periods of time. Several processes create mixing; this instability results in haline convection, creating downward fingering, stable rising of horizontal saltwater front, and unstable upward fingerings of flushing freshwater. The time lag between the sea tide fluctuations and the emergence of adequate fresh- and saltwater is higher in a stratified system compared to a homogeneous system. Furthermore, longer tide cycles lead to the enlargement of the FSI's toe horizontal movement range. The combination of tidal forcing with a layering aquifer structure leads to a wider FSI by creating a significant salt- and freshwater mixing inside each layer, vertical flows between the layers, and saltwater bodies at isolated areas. Haline convection within the FSI might be the reason for the wider fresh-saline interfaces that are found in field studies.",2021,,WATER,13,13,,WOS:000671273200001,10.3390/w13131780,,#19394,Ben-Zur 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/w13131780,,,,,
Degradation of groundwater quality in the coastal aquifers of the USA,"Lotfata, A; Ambinakudige, S","The objective of this study is to analyze groundwater types and the extent of seawater intrusion in terms of ion concentrations in groundwater sample using USGS monitoring wells.

Results showed that the dominating groundwater chemistry in the study area was Na+ and Cl-. Results also indicated that seawater intrusion of groundwater occurred in the US coastal aquifers. Based on the results of GQI (mix) and GQI (dom), most of the wells fell under domain II in the Piper diagram, indicating that they were of the Na-Cl water type.

Sea-level rise and other influences on decadal-scale salinity variability in a coastal plain estuary,"Ross, AC; Najjar, RG; Li, M; Mann, ME; Ford, SE; Katz, B","The response of salinity in the Delaware Estuary to climatic variations is determined using statistical models and long-term (1950-present) records of salinity from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory. The statistical models include non-parametric terms and are robust against autocorrelated and heteroscedastic errors. After using the models to adjust for the influence of streamflow and seasonal effects on salinity, several locations in the estuary show significant upward trends in salinity. Insignificant trends are found at locations that are normally upstream of the salt front. The models indicate a positive correlation between rising sea levels and increasing residual salinity, with salinity rising from 2.5 to 4.4 per meter of sea-level rise. These results are consistent with results from 1D and dynamical models. Wind stress also appears to play some role in driving salinity variations, consistent with its effect on vertical mixing and Ekman transport between the estuary and the ocean. The results suggest that continued sea-level rise in the future will cause salinity to increase regardless of any change in streamflow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analytical solutions of seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers,"Lu, CH; Xin, P; Kong, J; Li, L; Luo, J","Sloping coastal aquifers in reality are ubiquitous and well documented. Steady state sharp-interface analytical solutions for describing seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers are developed based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation. Specifically, analytical solutions based on the constant-flux inland boundary condition are derived by solving the discharge equation for the interface zone with the continuity conditions of the head and flux applied at the interface between the freshwater zone and the interface zone. Analytical solutions for the constant-head inland boundary are then obtained by developing the relationship between the inland freshwater flux and hydraulic head and combining this relationship with the solutions of the constant-flux inland boundary. It is found that for the constant-flux inland boundary, the shape of the saltwater interface is independent of the geometry of the bottom confining layer for both aquifer types, despite that the geometry of the bottom confining layer determines the location of the interface tip. This is attributed to that the hydraulic head at the interface is identical to that of the coastal boundary, so the shape of the bed below the interface is irrelevant to the interface position. Moreover, developed analytical solutions with an empirical factor on the density factor are in good agreement with the results of variable-density flow numerical modeling. Analytical solutions developed in this study provide a powerful tool for assessment of seawater intrusion in sloping coastal aquifers as well as in coastal aquifers with a known freshwater flux but an arbitrary geometry of the bottom confining layer.",2016,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,52,9,6989-7004,WOS:000386977900016,10.1002/2016WR019101,,#19454,Lu 2016,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019101,,,,,
"Seawater intrusion mediates species transition in low salinity, tidal marsh vegetation","Sutter, LA; Chambers, RM; Perry, JE","In a transitioning tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) experiencing relative sea-level rise, the native vegetation community has been introduced to both an abiotic stressor (salt) and a new plant competitor (Spartina alterniflora). Within a narrow salinity range (0-3), we examined the interplay between salt stress and plant interactions by comparing growth and nutrient status of Spartina alterniflora grown alone and in the presence of one of three TFM species (Leersia oryzoides, Peltandra virginica, and Phragmites australis). We conducted a mesocosm study pairing Spartina alterniflora with a TFM plant or a conspecific and subjecting the pairs to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 1.5, and 3). Measured plant traits included net photosynthesis (A(net)), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and their corresponding ratios. Relative to Spartina alterniflora grown alone, the presence of either TFM grass (Leersia oryzoides and Phragmites australis): (1) altered Spartina alterniflora A(net), (2) suppressed Spartina alterniflora biomass accumulation aboveground and belowground in all salinity treatment levels, and (3) altered aboveground and belowground tissue nutrient content. Regardless of neighbor, Spartina alterniflora's growth and nutrient status was greatest at the lowest salinity and remained largely unchanged in the presence of Peltandra virginica. These results suggest that Spartina alterniflora can successfully expand into TFM communities. Once established, salt stress eventually may hasten the transition to a Spartina alterniflora-dominated marsh community. The success of Spartina alterniflora may allow these marshes to maintain vegetation and increase their likelihood of maintaining elevation with rising sea level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using wave runup modeling to inform coastal species management: An example application for sea turtle nest relocation,"Ware, M; Long, JW; Fuentes, MMPB","The inundation of foreshore and backshore coastal environments caused by wave runup or groundwater intrusion can be extremely detrimental for beach-dwelling organisms. For beach-nesting species, whose eggs require sufficient gas exchange with the surrounding environment for proper embryonic development, inundation for prolonged periods can result in embryonic mortality. Management strategies such as the relocation of nests high on the beach to avoid wave action have been applied for some species, though this strategy may result in unnecessary nest manipulation. To improve the identification of beach locations potentially exposed to inundation caused by wave wash-over which may require management action, wave runup models were tested in Fort Morgan, Alabama, USA for the 2016 sea turtle nesting season. The potential exposure of sea turtle nesting sites to wave wash-over was determined by comparing observed nest elevations to the predicted combined elevation of wave runup, tide, and surge (i.e., total water level). Total water level was calculated using three different definitions of beach slope: foreshore, nest, and dune-to-water (DTW), and two LiDAR-derived elevation estimates: the most recent survey from 2016 and a time-averaged digital elevation model (DEM). Models using the time-averaged DEM performed as well as, or better than, those using the 2016 LiDAR survey in the majority of comparisons. Wash-over state was correctly identified for up to 83.3% of sites when using nest slope in the wave runup calculation. However, DTW slope performed the best when predicting the wash-over frequency of a site. Mapping of the predicted 98th percentile of wave runup indicated that only 11.2% of nesting sites were exposed to wave wash-over, in contrast to the 21.3% of nests which were relocated. Wave runup models have not previously been used to inform sea turtle conservation actions; however, it holds promise for improved targeted management interventions and can assist other species (e.g., shorebirds, beach mice), which rely on dry beach habitat for nesting, feeding, and migratory rest stops. Wave runup models can also be used to investigate past storm events, forecast approaching storm impacts, and supplement sea level rise scenarios for coastal species management at multiple spatial scales.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,173,,17-25,WOS:000465057000003,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.02.011,,#19469,Ware 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.02.011,Fort Morgan,Alabama,USA,,
Biogeochemical Recovery of Oligohaline Wetland Soils Experiencing a Salinity Pulse,"Kiehn, WM; Mendelssohn, IA; White, JR","Oligohaline wetlands exist at a dynamic interface along a river-to-estuary gradient where salinity changes frequently due to fluctuating tidal cycles and weather events. Large storms can cause short-term saltwater intrusion into these low-lying coastal areas, exposing oligohaline wetland plants and soils to above-normal salinities and severe stress on wetland organisms. The objective of this study was to determine how oligohaline wetland soils respond to a single pulse saltwater intrusion, similar to what may occur during hurricane-associated storm surge. Soil response variables were measured in intrusion-Impacted and Reference soils before, during, and after a 6-wk saltwater intrusion event to determine potential impacts on microbial biomass and activity and associated nutrient dynamics. We observed no significant change in basal CO2 or CH4 production in oligohaline soils (interstitial salinity = 1.3 +/- 0.1 practical salinity units [psu]; mean +/- 1 SD) exposed to 20 psu saltwater, while substrate-induced methanogenesis was negatively correlated with salinity. Microbial biomass C (MBC) responded positively to saltwater intrusion by doubling in concentration at the 0- to 5-cm depth interval. Saltwater intrusion had no impact on porewater nutrient concentrations; however, extractable NH4+ decreased as salinity increased. Although some significant changes in microbial activity, abundance, and nutrient availability occurred due to saltwater intrusion, these impacts were generally transient, with post-intrusion conditions resembling pre-intrusion conditions. These results suggest that short-term and transient saltwater intrusion may have little longer-term effect on wetland soil biogeochemistry. However, compounding effects of frequent saltwater intrusion pulses due to strong, regularly occurring storm events could cause longer-lasting shifts in biogeochemical functioning of these wetlands.",2013,,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,77,6,2205-2215,WOS:000327024500032,10.2136/sssaj2013.05.0202,,#19478,Kiehn 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.05.0202,Oligohaline,,,,

Five salinity levels were investigated - 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 g l(-1) artificial seawater - all with flooding to approximately 5 cm above the soil surface. Survival, height growth, leaf area and total biomass all declined with increasing salinity. Significant variation was found among salinity levels, families, and salinity X family interactions for leaf area and total biomass. Two tolerance indices were also developed to compare family response with salinity. In general, families from brackish sources had greater total biomass, leaf area, and tolerance index values than families from freshwater sources at the higher salinity levels.

Consequently the ecological structure, their functions, and the goods and services of the coastal regions are being modified. The ecosystem resilience will be greatly reduced through human impacts as well as rising sea levels, increasing sea temperatures, and other climate ocean-related changes, including prevailing wave activity and storm waves and surges. Sea level rise and increased seawater temperatures are projected to accelerate beach erosion and cause degradation of natural coastal defences such as mangroves and coral reefs resulting in negative effect on the socio-economic aspects of coastal population.

"Biogeochemical behavior of P in the soil and porewater of a low-salinity estuarine wetland: Availability, diffusion kinetics, and mobilization mechanism","Hu, MJ; Sardans, J; Le, YX; Yan, RB; Zhong, Y; Huang, JF; Penuelas, J; Tong, C","Estuarine wetlands, which typically store large amounts of phosphorus (P), are experiencing increased salinity as well as changed environmental factors caused by rising sea levels. In this study, the seasonal dynamics of P speciation, availability, and biogeochemical couplings with iron (Fe)-sulfur (S) in soil and porewater were measured in a low-salinity estuarine wetland using in situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and dialysis (HR-Peeper) techniques. The diffusion kinetics and resupply capacity of P from the soil phase to solution were simulated using a DGT-induced fluxes in soils (DIFS) model. The transition from freshwater to brackish wetlands reduced soil P pools and shifted to more recalcitrant speciation. The concentration of DGT-labile P across the soil-water profiles ranged from 0.002 to 0.039 (mean: 0.015) mg L-1, which increased with increasing salinity in both the field and mesocosm experiments. The distributions of labile and soluble P showed high heterogeneity across the profiles, and there were some sharp peak values below the soil-water interface (SWI), which significantly increased the concentration and lability of P. The strong coupling between labile P and Fe (S) provided direct evidence for the coexistence of iron reduction (IR) and sulfate reduction (SR) in the estuary, while IR might predominate in P mobilization in the brackish environment because of higher labile Fe concentrations and stronger Fe-P couplings. The diffusion fluxes of P were positive at both sites, demonstrating that the kinetics of P were from the soils to the overlying water. Higher R and k(-1) values fitted in the DIFS model implied that a stronger resupply capacity and desorption rate and thus faster remobilization kinetics of P occurred with increasing salinity. Our findings indicated that increased salinity (even at low levels) can alter the desorption rate and resupply capacity of soil P in estuarine wetlands and accelerate P remobilization and release by regulating the IR and SR processes, thereby leading to the deterioration of water quality.",2022,,WATER RESEARCH,219,,,WOS:000889435600007,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118617,,#19503,Hu 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118617,L-1,,,,
"High-resolution subsurface (GPR) imaging and sedimentology of coastal ponds, Maine, USA: Implications for holocene back-barrier evolution","Buynevich, IV; Fitzgerald, DM","Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) transects and sediment cores have been used to examine the basement morphology, stratigraphy, and environmental history of maritime ponds along the peninsular coast of Maine. Silver Lake, Lily Pond, and North Pond are shallow (< 3 m) water bodies bordered by steep bedrock ridges in the north, east, and west, and sandy barriers to the south. The bedrock basins of the ponds are formed in metasedimentary rocks surrounded by resistant pegmatitic intrusions. A dense network of GPR traverses obtained over the ice-covered Silver Lake reveals a series of prominent wavy-parallel and basin-fill reflector geometries terminating against the bedrock or grading into the barrier sediments and interpreted as organic lake-bottom facies. The transparent units represent sand-rich horizons, mostly eolian in origin. Convex-up structures found both on the surface and within the basin-fill sequence are interpreted as preserved parts of coastal dunes. The present study indicates that freshwater conditions prevailed since at least 4.6 ka, with an initial sedimentation rate of 1.7 mm/yr. The position of this unit below the contemporary sea level suggests presence of a welded barrier by that time. Radar profiles taken along the shores of Lily Pond, a small water body behind the Sand Dune Barrier, indicate a significantly larger areal extent of the pond in the past. A succession of organic deposits overlying a Pleistocene glaciomarine unit indicates progressive inundation of the paleo-lagoon by rising sea level. Saltwater peat seaward of Lily Pond was buried by washover sands, about 1.2 ka, and a narrow pond existed here prior to dredging and artificial infilling of its eastern part in the 1950s-60s. The organic and eolian units are absent in the North Pond, where sedimentary fill consists of glaciomarine clay overlain by marine sands. A proposed three-stage model of pond evolution along an embayed coastline consists of: (1) organic accumulation in an upland depression during lower sea level; (2) predominantly washover or tidal deposition in a lagoon (Stage 2a) or blocked coastal pond (Stage 2b) during initial transgression, and (3) mainly eolian and organic deposition behind a prograded or aggraded barrier.

Compositional Effects of Sea-Level Rise in a Patchy Landscape: The Dynamics of Tree Islands in the Southeastern Coastal Everglades,"Ross, MS; Sah, JP; Meeder, JF; Ruiz, PL; Telesnicki, G","The landscape structure of emergent wetlands in undeveloped portions of the southeastern coastal Everglades is comprised of two distinct components: scattered forest fragments, or tree islands, surrounded by a low matrix of marsh or shrub-dominated vegetation. Changes in the matrix, including the inland transgression of salt-tolerant mangroves and the recession of sawgrass marshes, have been attributed to the combination of sea level rise and reductions in fresh water supply. In this study we examined concurrent changes in the composition of the region's tree islands over a period of almost three decades. No trend in species composition toward more salt-tolerant trees was observed anywhere, but species characteristic of freshwater swamps increased in forests in which fresh water supply was augmented. Tree islands in the coastal Everglades appear to be buffered from some of the short term effects of salt water intrusion, due to their ability to build soils above the surface of the surrounding wetlands, thus maintaining mesophytic conditions. However, the apparent resistance of tree islands to changes associated with sea level rise is likely to be a temporary stage, as continued salt water intrusion will eventually overwhelm the forests' capacity to maintain fresh water in the rooting zone.",2014,,WETLANDS,34,,S91-S100,WOS:000345634700009,10.1007/s13157-013-0376-2,,#19536,Ross 2014,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0376-2,,,,,
Numerical modeling and sensitivity analysis of seawater intrusion in a dual-permeability coastal karst aquifer with conduit networks,"Xu, ZX; Hu, BX; Ye, M","Long-distance seawater intrusion has been widely observed through the subsurface conduit system in coastal karst aquifers as a source of groundwater contaminant. In this study, seawater intrusion in a dual-permeability karst aquifer with conduit networks is studied by the two-dimensional density-dependent flow and transport SEAWAT model. Local and global sensitivity analyses are used to evaluate the impacts of boundary conditions and hydrological characteristics on modeling seawater intrusion in a karst aquifer, including hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, specific storage, and dispersivity of the conduit network and of the porous medium. The local sensitivity analysis evaluates the parameters' sensitivities for modeling seawater intrusion, specifically in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP). A more comprehensive interpretation of parameter sensitivities, including the nonlinear relationship between simulations and parameters, and/or parameter interactions, is addressed in the global sensitivity analysis. The conduit parameters and boundary conditions are important to the simulations in the porous medium because of the dynamical exchanges between the two systems. The sensitivity study indicates that salinity and head simulations in the karst features, such as the conduit system and submarine springs, are critical for understanding seawater intrusion in a coastal karst aquifer. The evaluation of hydraulic conductivity sensitivity in the continuum SEAWAT model may be biased since the conduit flow velocity is not accurately calculated by Darcy's equation as a function of head difference and hydraulic conductivity. In addition, dispersivity is no longer an important parameter in an advection-dominated karst aquifer with a conduit system, compared to the sensitivity results in a porous medium aquifer. In the end, the extents of seawater intrusion are quantitatively evaluated and measured under different scenarios with the variabilities of important parameters identified from sensitivity results, including salinity at the submarine spring with rainfall recharge, sea level rise, and a longer simulation time under an extended low rainfall period.",2018,,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,22,1,221-239,WOS:000419992400001,10.5194/hess-22-221-2018,,#19548,Xu 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-221-2018,,,,,
MASS MORTALITY OF THE EASTERN OYSTER CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA IN THE WESTERN MISSISSIPPI SOUND FOLLOWING UNPRECEDENTED MISSISSIPPI RIVER FLOODING IN 2019,"Gledhill, JH; Barnett, AF; Slattery, M; Willett, KL; Easson, GL; Otts, SS; Gochfeld, DJ","Globally, precipitation is expected to increase along with the rise of temperatures due to climate change, increasing the likelihood of freshwater intrusion into coastal ecosystems. In the spring and summer of 2019. heavy rainfall and snowmelt in the midwestern United States caused historic flooding of the Mississippi River, warranting two openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to reduce pressure on levees in New Orleans, LA. These openings released an unprecedented volume of freshwater into Lake Pontchartrain and subsequently into the Mississippi Sound. This study investigated the impacts of these freshwater releases on populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and water quality in the western Mississippi Sound and the Bay of St. Louis. Platforms housing oysters and water quality sensors that measured dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were deployed at oyster reef sites. At each reef, native oyster populations were assessed via dredge sampling to determine oyster survival.

Replenishing an unconfined coastal aquifer to control seawater intrusion: Injection or infiltration?,"Lu, CH; Shi, WL; Xin, P; Wu, JC; Werner, AD","In this study, we compare the performances of well injection and pond infiltration in controlling seawater intrusion in an unconfined coastal aquifer through two scenario groups: (1) a single injection well versus an elliptic infiltration pond and (2) an injection-extraction well pair system versus an elliptic infiltration pond-extraction well system. Comparison is based on quantitative indicators that include the interface toe location, saltwater volume, and maximum net extraction rate (for scenario 2). We introduce a method to determine the maximum net extraction rate for cases where the locations of stagnation points cannot be easily derived. Analytical analysis shows that the performances of injection and infiltration are the same, provided that the pond shape is circular. The examination of scenario group 1 suggests that the shape of the infiltration pond has a minor effect on the interface toe location as well as the reduction in the saltwater volume, given the same total recharge rate. The investigation of scenario group 2 indicates, by contrast, that the maximum net extraction rate increases significantly with the increasing ratio of b to a, where a and b are semiaxes of the ellipse parallel and perpendicular to the coastline, respectively. Specifically, for a typical aquifer assumed, an increase of 40% is obtained for the maximum net extraction when b/a increases from 1/200 to 200. Despite that the study is based on a simplified model, the results provide initial guidance for practitioners when planning to use an aquifer recharge strategy to restore a salinized unconfined coastal aquifer.",2017,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,53,6,4775-4786,WOS:000405997000016,10.1002/2016WR019625,,#19569,Lu 2017,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019625,,,,,
Solving the salinity control problem in a potable water system,"Choi, CW; Lee, JHM","Salinity is the relative concentration of salts in water. In a city of southern China, the local water supply company Pumps water from a nearby river for potable use. During the winter dry season, the intrusion of sea water raises the salinity of the river to a high level and affects approximately the daily life of 450,000 residents of the city. This paper reports the application of constraint programming (CP) to optimize the logistical operations of the raw water system so as to satisfy the daily water consumption requirement of the city and to keep the potable salinity below a desirable level for as many days as possible. CP is the key to the Success of the project for its separation of concerns and powerful constraint language that allows for rapid construction of a functional prototype and production system. Flexibility and adaptiveness allow us to deal with our clients' many changes in the requirements. Deriving good variable and value ordering heuristics, and generating useful implied constraints, we demonstrate that branch-and-bound search with constraint propagation can cope with an optimization problem of large size and great difficulty.",2007,,PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING - CP 2007,4741,,33-48,WOS:000250936000003,,,#19576,Choi 2007,,,https://doi.org/nan,China,,,,
Hydrodynamic behavior of the Cape Fear River and estuarine system: A synthesis and observational investigation of discharge-salinity intrusion relationships,"Becker, ML; Luettich, RA; Mallin, MA","Transport of constituents in partially mixed estuaries depends on the relative strengths of dominant forcing mechanisms which may include tides, river input, and wind. In this study, we investigated the major physical mechanisms that influence the salinity structure in the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE), a partially mixed estuary that is representative of river-dominated estuaries along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. Based on analysis of observed hydrographic and hydrodynamic data, we first describe differences in velocity, salinity, and stratification at along-channel sections of the estuary for relatively low-flow conditions. We then investigate the influence of river inflow on the salinity intrusion (defined by the 1-salinity contour near the bottom), based on six methods of choosing discharge in order to identify an appropriate means of incorporating flow history into the discharge value.Our analyses indicate: 1) 92 percent of the variability in the length of the salinity intrusion over a five-year period can be explained based on the Hydrologic Flood Method identified in this work, 2) the salinity intrusion depends more weakly on discharge than predicted by classic analytical relationships for exchange-dominated systems in which the intrusion varies with discharge to the power of (-1/3), and 3) intra-tidal and tidal-range differences based on a 29-day modulation significantly influence the salinity structure.Our results suggest that the salinity intrusion location is dependent upon the hydrologic ""flood,"" defined by a peak in the river-discharge hydrograph. The analysis indicates that the new method used to determine discharge in the CFRE can more accurately explain river inflow salinity relationships than previously investigated methods. In river-estuary systems in which hydrologic flood peaks are large relative to base flow, we hypothesize the hydrologic flood model offers a useful tool for predicting the estuarine salinity response to river inflow.

Numerical modeling and management of saltwater seepage from coastal brackish canals in southeast Florida,"Koch, M; Zhang, G","The phenomenon of density-driven vertical salt water intrusion from brackish open sea-canals in southeast Florida has been simulated with a density-coupled groundwater flow and transport model. The underlying conceptual model includes seasonal changes of the groundwater level, tidal variations of the canal stage, rainfall recharge, and a low permeability canal bed. As expected, whether brackish canal water intrudes into die aquifer, depends on the adjacent groundwater table elevation: lowering the latter during a dry season may initiate the seepage process which then becomes essentially irreversible. A significant influence of the short-term tidal fluctuations on the long-term dispersion of the vertical saltwater plume in the aquifer is found. The model is applied td simulate how the large Hollywood well field affects salt water intrusion from the adjacent C-10 tidal canal, and to determine possible mitigating water management strategies to prevent further intrusion. The models show that, for attaining this objective, a minimum threshold water level must be maintained in the well field during the dry seasons. However, raising the water table cannot be achieved by artificial injection of reclaimed wastewater, but may be accomplished by placing a freshwater canal along the brackish C-10 tidal canal.",1998,,ENVIRONMENTAL COASTAL REGIONS,,,395-404,WOS:000077844400037,,,#19597,Koch 1998,,,https://doi.org/nan,Florida,Hollywood,,,
Sea level rise effect on seawater intrusion into layered coastal aquifers (simulation using dispersive and sharp-interface approaches),"Mehdizadeh, SS; Karamalipour, SE; Asoodeh, R","Concerning about sea level rise (SLR) effect on seawater intrusion (SWI) has been grown up for the last decade and numerous studies have addressed the extents, rates and timescales associated with SWI induced by SLR mostly for homogeneous cases. In layered aquifers, vertical leakage through layers makes the intrusion mechanism different compared to homogeneous one. In this study, series of simulations using dispersive SEAWAT and a developed sharp -interface models have been carried out to investigate gradual and instantaneous SLR (respectively named GSLR and ISLR) effect on SWI into field-scale layered aquifer with constant freshwater inflow boundary condition. Two scenarios have been defined for this purpose, including an aquitard with two different hydraulic conductivities (i.e.K' [L/T] = 0.01 and 0.0001 m/d) that is placed between two extensively higher permeable layers. By SEAWAT, it is found that for ISLR problem with higher aquitard K' value, where freshwater can leak upward across the aquitard, seawater intrude more appreciable into bottom layer rather than the upper one. For the upper layer, seawater intrude toward land at early times but then naturally driven back to almost its original position (called as overshoot). At the second scenario with lower K' where almost no freshwater can leak upward, the ambient freshwater inflow push the lower layer salt wedge back toward the sea. For the GSLR, gradual increment of seawater head lets the freshwater to be delivered into unsaturated part of the upper layer and hence seawater intrudes through the system but with low rate. At the lower layer of higher K' scenario with GSLR, freshwater upward leakage causes SWI more obvious compare to the other scenario and horizontal freshwater flow prevents seawater to intrude through the lower layer. The sharp -interface model successfully predicted the same trend compare to dispersive SEAWAT model but over -predicted the interface line. It weaker matched with SEAWAT result for lower K'scenario where it cannot successfully predict the correct amount of freshwater upward leakage. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling and uncertainty analysis of seawater intrusion based on surrogate models,"Miao, TS; Lu, WX; Guo, JY; Lin, J; Fan, Y","When using a simulation model to study seawater intrusion (SI), uncertainty in the parameters directly affects the results. The impact of the rise in sea levels due to global warming on SI cannot be ignored. In this paper, the Monte Carlo method is used to analyze the uncertainty in modeling SI. To reduce the computational cost of the repeated invocation of the simulation model as well as time, a surrogate model is established using a radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network method. To enhance the accuracy of the substitution model, input samples are sampled using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The results of uncertainty analysis had a high reference value and show the following: (1) The surrogate model created using the RBF method can significantly reduce computational cost and save at least 95% of the time needed for the repeated invocation of the simulation model while maintaining high accuracy. (2) Uncertainty in the parameters and the magnitude of the rise in sea levels have a significant impact on SI. The results of prediction were thus highly uncertain.

"Uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion in fractured coastal aquifers: Effects of fracture location, aperture, density and hydrodynamic parameters","Koohbor, B; Fahs, M; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Belfort, B; Simmons, CT; Younes, A","In this study we use polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion (SWI) in fractured coastal aquifers (FCAs) which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network (DFN) and variable-density flow (VDF) models. The DFN-VDF model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures. In real field applications, these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model. Thus, we perform global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs. As our conceptual model, we consider fractured configurations of the Henry Problem which is widely used to understand SWI processes. A finite element DFN-VDF model is developed in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics (R). We examine the uncertainty of several SWI metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics. PCE is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden. A new sparse PCE technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost. The Sobol' indices (SIs) are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties. The proposed GSA methodology based on PCE and SIs is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy. It shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution. The imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer. Marginal effects based on the PCE are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on SWI. The findings provide a technical support for monitoring, controlling and preventing SWI in FCAs.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,571,,159-177,WOS:000462692100014,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.052,,#19626,Koohbor 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.052,,,,,
Influence of variable salinity conditions in a tidal creek on riparian groundwater flow and salinity dynamics,"Lenkopane, M; Werner, AD; Lockington, DA; Li, L","While recent studies have revealed that tidal fluctuations in an estuary significantly affect groundwater flows and salt transport in the riparian zone, only seawater salinity in the estuary has been considered. A numerical study is conducted to investigate the influence of estuarine salinity variations on the groundwater flow and salt dynamics in the adjacent aquifer to extend our understanding of these complex and dynamic systems. Tidal salinity fluctuations (synchronous with estuary stage) were found to alter the magnitude and distribution of groundwater discharge to the estuary, which subsequently impacted on groundwater salinity patterns and residence times, especially in the riparian zone. The effects of salinity fluctuations were not fully captured by adopting a constant, time-averaged estuarine salinity. The modelling analysis also included an assessment of the impact of a seasonal freshwater flush in the estuary, similar to that expected in tropical climates (e.g. mean estuary level during flood significantly greater than average), on adjacent groundwater flow and salinity conditions. The three-month freshwater flushing event temporarily disrupted the salt distribution and re-circulation patterns predicted to occur under conditions of constant salinity and tidal water level fluctuations in the estuary. The results indicate that the salinity variations in tidal estuaries impact significantly on estuary-aquifer interaction and need to be accounted for to properly assess salinity and flow dynamics and groundwater residence times of riparian zones.

Experimental and numerical assessment of saltwater recession in coastal aquifers by constructing check dams,"Mehdizadeh, SS; Ketabchi, H; Ghoroqi, M; Hasanzadeh, AK","Artificial freshwater recharge has been considered as a feasible and effective procedure to mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal regions. The efficiency of freshwater infiltration through a check dam reservoir on saltwater recession (SWR) is investigated using two physical models. The results demonstrate the apparent tendency of recharge freshwater to move horizontally toward the boundaries rather than flowing downward to influence saltwater wedge toe. Thereby, it would affect the saltwater wedge tip instead of its toe due to the new establishment of a positive hydraulic gradient from a dam reservoir to the boundaries. Moreover, numerical dispersive simulations have been carried out on a large-scale aquifer to find the optimum location of the dam as well as the aquifer characteristics impacts on SWR efficiency. The results show that the best location to construct a check dam is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe. It is found that when saltwater head declines, the steeper hydraulic gradient between boundaries is established and the efficiency of recharge performance will be improved. Moreover, the reduction of hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction improves SWR, while higher hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous cases only accelerates the infiltration rate but has no meaningful effect in the long term. The considered recharge method also works better in scenarios with higher dispersivity. However, the construction of check dams on floodways might be a practical and low-cost solution but it can be concluded that as the dominant direction of the recharged freshwater is toward boundaries, it cannot promptly retreat saltwater around toe position.",2020,,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,231,,,WOS:000530026100004,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103637,,#19646,Mehdizadeh 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103637,,,,,

"Variation in Salinity Tolerance among Larval Anurans: Implications for Community Composition and the Spread of an Invasive, Non-native Species","Brown, ME; Walls, SC","Amphibians in freshwater coastal wetlands periodically experience acute exposure to salinity from hurricane-related overwash events, as well as chronic exposure associated with rising sea levels. In a comparative experimental approach, we examined whether seven species of anuran amphibians vary in their tolerance to changes in salinity. In a laboratory study, we exposed larval Hyla cinerea (Green Treefrog), H. squirella (Squirrel Treefrog), Litho bates catesbeianus (American Bullfrog), L. sphenocephalus (Southern Leopard Frog), Anaxyrus terrestris (Southern Toad), and Gastrophryne carolinensis (Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad) from an inland population in north central Florida, USA, and Osteopilus septentrionalis (Cuban Treefrog) tadpoles from an inland population in southwest Florida, to acute salinity for 72 h. For each species, we replicated trials in which tadpoles were exposed to salinities of 0.2 (control), 5, 10, 12, 14, and 16 ppt. For all species, tadpoles reared in the control and 5 ppt treatments had 96.7-100% survival. No individuals of G. carolinensis survived at salinities exceeding 5 ppt and no individuals of any species survived in the 14 or 16 ppt treatments. For all other native species, survival at 10 ppt ranged from 46.7 to 80%, but declined to 0% at 12 ppt (except for H. cinerea, of which only 3.3% survived at 12 ppt). In contrast, all individuals of the invasive, non-native 0. septentrionalis survived exposure to a salinity of 10 ppt, and survival in this species remained relatively high at 12 ppt. Our results illustrate that the non-native 0. septentrionalis has a higher salinity tolerance than the native species tested, which may contribute to its invasion potential. Moreover, species commonly associated with coastal freshwater wetlands differ in their salinity tolerances, suggesting that salt water intrusion due to storm surges and sea level rise may affect the species composition of these ecosystems.",2013,,COPEIA,,3,543-551,WOS:000335277800022,10.1643/CH-12-159,,#19663,Brown 2013,,,https://doi.org/10.1643/CH-12-159,Florida,USA,,,
Small gradients in salinity have large effects on stand water use in freshwater wetland forests,"Duberstein, JA; Krauss, KW; Baldwin, MJ; Allen, ST; Conner, WH; Salter, JS; Miloshis, M","Salinity intrusion is responsible for changes to freshwater wetland watersheds globally, but little is known about how wetland water budgets might be influenced by small increments in salinity. We studied a forested wetland in South Carolina, USA, and installed sap flow probes on 72 trees/shrubs along a salinity gradient. Species investigated included the trees baldcypress (Taxodium distichum [L.] Rich.), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.), swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora Walt.), and the shrub waxmyrtle (Morella cerifera (L.) Small). This study improves upon past reliance on greenhouse seedling studies by adding measurements of trees/shrubs along a salinity gradient, and better describes the role of low salinity on water use in freshwater wetland forests. We measured patterns of water use related to salinity, atmospheric conditions and season, and hypothesized that salinity would influence wetland forest water use through two mechanisms: salinity disturbances would yield stands with species and size classes that transpire less and individual trees with less conductive xylem tissue (i.e., sapwood). Both hypotheses held. At salinity concentrations ranging from fresh to 3 psu, forest structural changes alone resulted in stand water use reductions from 494 mm year(-1) in freshwater stands to 316 mm year(-1) in stands of slightly higher salinity. Tree sapwood function (inferred from radial sap flux profiles) also changed along this gradient and reduced sap flow rates by an additional 13.3% per unit increase in salinity (psu). Thus, stand water use was further reduced to 190 mm year(-1) on saline sites. We found that forest structure is not the only change that affects water use in salinized watersheds; individual tree eco-physiological responses to salinity, manifesting in different radial sap flow profiles, are important as well.",2020,,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,473,,,WOS:000551979700034,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118308,,#19669,Duberstein 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118308,Nyssa,South Carolina,USA,,

We developed a numerical modeling approach for a partially mixed estuary to simulate long-term alterations to hydrodynamics and transport processes induced from human modifications; two types of partially embanked storm surge barriers across the mouth of Chesapeake Bay were examined. Under modeled scenarios, surge barriers exerted a significant influence on the tide, salinity, residual current, and transport processes. The surge barrier caused (1) a reduction of tidal range inside the estuary, (2) stronger stratification and further salt intrusion, weaker vertical mixing and larger vertical exchange time, and (3) a decrease of bottom inflow in the mainstem and weakened horizontal water exchange. The change of horizontal water exchange and residence time was not a linear response with the barrier size and it varied at different regions of the estuary.

An Analysis of Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) BSP) Tree Rings as Indicators of Ghost Forest Development in a Globally Threatened Ecosystem,"Doyle, JM; Earley, KE; Atkinson, RB","Atlantic White Cedar (AWC) swamps are a globally threatened type of wetland ecosystem and are a new form of ghost forest in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. Hydrogeomorphic regimes foster peat formation, resulting in unique biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. Our sites include regimes that are exposed to sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater intrusion, yet other sites are protected by higher elevations. In this study, we evaluated climatic variables to discern differences in tree ring formation as an indicator of growth among nine stands including micro-tidal, oligohaline sites as well as other protected areas which served as a control. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used, and series were divided into two sub-chronologies, 1895 to 1971 (early) and 1972 to 2018 (recent). AWC growth in response to precipitation parameters, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were largely non-significant but were somewhat reversed among sub-chronologies. Early correlations were primarily negatively correlated with PDSI, while recent correlations were mostly positive, which suggests that even though inundation may reduce photosynthate availability for growth, precipitation has begun to increase growth by alleviating osmotic and toxic stresses associated with seawater. Analysis of climatic variables and tree growth at the reference site found that other anthropogenic stressors associated with ditching exert a greater influence. Hurricane impacts on tree growth exhibited no lasting negative effects; however, an AWC ghost forest report from New Jersey connected mortality to a hurricane.

Sustainability of fresh groundwater resources in fifteen major deltas around the world,"van Engelen, J; Essink, GHPO; Bierkens, MFP","Population growth, urbanization and intensification of irrigated agriculture in the world's deltas boost the demand for fresh water, with extensive groundwater extraction as a result. This, in turn, leads to salt water intrusion and upconing, which poses a threat to freshwater and food security. Managing fresh groundwater resources in deltas requires accurate knowledge about the current status and behaviour of their fresh groundwater resources. However, this knowledge is scarcely present, especially for groundwater at larger depths. Here, we use three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model simulations over the last 125 ka to estimate the volume of fresh groundwater resources for 15 major deltas around the world. We estimate current volumes of onshore fresh groundwater resources for individual deltas to vary between 10(10) m(3) and 10(12) m(3). Offshore, the estimated volumes of fresh groundwater are generally smaller, though with a considerably higher variability. In 9 out of 15 simulated deltas, fresh groundwater volumes developed over thousands of years. Based on current groundwater extraction and recharge rates, we estimate the time until in-situ fresh groundwater resources are completely exhausted, partly leading to groundwater level decline and mostly replacement with river water or saline groundwater. This straightforward analysis shows that 4 out of 15 deltas risk complete exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources within 300 m depth in 200 years. These deltas also suffer from saline surface water which means their groundwater resources will progressively salinize. With a fourfold increase in extraction rates, seven deltas risk a complete exhaustion within 200 years. Of these seven deltas, six suffer from saline surface water. We stress that the groundwater of these six vulnerable deltas should be carefully managed, to avoid non-renewable groundwater use. The progressive exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources in these deltas will hamper their ability to withstand periods of water scarcity.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,12,,WOS:000999058700001,10.1088/1748-9326/aca16c,,#19702,vanEngelen 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aca16c,,,,,
Salinity Induced Antioxidant Defense in Roots of Industrial Hemp (IH: Cannabis sativa L.) for Fiber during Seed Germination,"Dixit, N","Global climate change induced sea level rise, rainfed agriculture, poor quality irrigation water, and seawater intrusion through interconnected ditches and inland waterways cause soil salinity in inland and coastal areas. To reclaim and prevent further soil erosion, salt tolerant crops are required. Industrial Hemp (IH: Cannabis sativa L.) is used for food, fiber, and medicinal purposes throughout the world. In spite of that, little is known about the salt tolerance mechanisms in IH. Seed germination and development of the roots are the primary events in the life cycle of a plant, which directly interact with soil salinity. Therefore, in vitro germination experiments were conducted on the roots of 5-day-old seedlings using four varieties (V1: CFX-2, V2: Joey, V3: Bialobrzeskie, and V4: Henola) of IH for fiber. Five salinity treatments (0, 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200 mM NaCl) were used to screen the IH varieties on the basis of I: seed germination percent (SGP), II: quantitative morphological observations (root length (RL) and root fresh weight (RFW)), III: oxidative stress indices (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation), and IV: antioxidant defense system comprises of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APOD), glutathione reductase (GR). The varieties V1 and V3 showed salt tolerance up to 100 mM by maintaining higher SGP, less reduction in RL and RFW. These roots in V1 and V3 showed lower levels of H2O2 and lipid peroxidation by displaying higher activities of SOD, CAT, GPOD, APOD, and GR while a reciprocal trend was observed in V4. However, roots in V2 showed higher activities of antioxidant enzymes with lower levels of H2O2 and lipid peroxidation, but showed declines in RL and RFW at 80 mM NaCl onward. Roots in V4 were the most susceptible to NaCl stress at 50 mM and onward.",2022,,ANTIOXIDANTS,11,2,,WOS:000767528400001,10.3390/antiox11020244,,#19726,Dixit 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11020244,IH,Bialobrzeskie,IV,,
Decadal scale recharge-discharge time lags from aquifer freshwater-saltwater interactions,"Klammler, H; Jawitz, JW; Annable, MD; Yaquian, JA; Hatfield, K; Burger, P","Coastal aquifers are an important freshwater resource for significant portions of the global population. Understanding the dynamic relationship between aquifer recharge, storage and discharge is fundamental for sustainable groundwater management. Here we present an expanded freshwater balance equation that considers the dynamic interaction between fresh groundwater and underlying saltwater through a respective storage term, which may explain significant time lags in long-term trends between recharge, storage and discharge. We demonstrate the presence of such a time lag and its effect on freshwater budget calculations with data from a major karst spring in Florida. We develop and validate a parsimonious aquifer model and show that our expanded water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi-decadal averages of rainfall and spring discharge. Long-term trends in precipitation are known to occur in many regions of the world, and we expect our findings to have direct relevance for coastal aquifers at a global scale.",2020,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,582,,,WOS:000517663700054,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124514,,#19728,Klammler 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124514,karst,Florida,,,
The variability of currents and sea level in the upper Delaware estuary,"Wong, KC; Sommerfield, CK","The variability of currents and sea levels in the upper Delaware estuary are examined based on measurements from bottom mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) deployed at two sites (New Castle and Tinicum) from 18 March to 10 June 2003 New Castle is located 104 km from the mouth, and Tinicum is located another 32 km up-estuary Supplemental data, including sea level at the mouth of the estuary, river discharge, and wind speed and direction, were also obtained from various federal agencies. The instantaneous current represents a superposition of variabililty driven by the tide, wind and niver discharge Over the short (<36 hr) time scale, the tide is the dominant forcing mechanism, with M2 being the principal tidal constituent. The amplitude of the M2 tide increases from the mouth to the upper estuary and gives rise to a vigorous M2 current of the order 80 cm s(-1.) On time scales of 36 to 120 hr, the effect of wind drives a weak subtidal current with a standard deviation of 2 cm s(-1) in the upper estiaru/ At time scales longer than 120 hr, the subtidal current variability, with a standard deviation of 6 cm s(-1), is dominated by the barotropic response of the upper estuary to variations in the river discharge. The upper estuary exhibits a strong down-estuary mean current of the order-15 cm s(-1.) At Tinicum, never discharge accounts for more than half of the mean current, which is characterized by down-estuary flow throughout the water column. The magnitude of the river discharge-induced mean current is reduced at New Castle, in direct response to the down-estuary increase in the cross-sectional area. Tidally rectified current accounts for the remainder of the overall mean flow at Tinicum, and the effect of tidal rectification may be more important than river discharge in producing the mean flow at New Castle. There is no evidence of a baroclinic gravitational circulation, as the salt intrusion generally does not extend into the upper estuary.",2009,,JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH,67,4,479-501,WOS:000275025800004,10.1357/002224009790741111,,#19735,Wong 2009,,,https://doi.org/10.1357/002224009790741111,Delaware,,,,
The Lower Mississippi River Floodplain Ecosystem: Current Status and Future Potential,"Eggleton, MA; Fontenot, QC; Jackson, JR","The lower Mississippi River encompasses the 1,535-km reach extending from the confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. Waters of the lower Mississippi River have historically inundated vast areas of adjacent floodplain during spring flood pulses. Additionally, processes of land building within the river's deltaic plain supported vast forests and diverse freshwater and salt-marsh habitats. Flood pulses provided a mechanism of lateral exchange of energy and nutrients between the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, while sediment loads continually rebuilt and supported the deltaic plain. As human populations and agriculture expanded throughout the lower Mississippi Valley, construction of flood-protection levee systems and commercial navigational structures severely decreased the connectivity between the lower Mississippi River and its floodplain. The current lower Mississippi River floodplain is more than 90% reduced in area compared to historical conditions. Fluvial dynamics, which are the driving forces that stimulate floodplain function and create diverse habitats, appear to have been altered throughout approximately 80% of the river. As a result, the hydrograph, thermograph, sedimentation patterns, nutrient dynamics, and vegetation communities within the lower Mississippi River floodplain have experienced major changes through time, with many large alterations occurring during the past century. In addition, because most of the sediment load of the lower Mississippi River now enters the northern Gulf of Mexico, land building and associated processes are much reduced in the river's deltaic plain. This process has allowed intrusion of saltwater into coastal habitats, which has heavily impacted vegetation communities. This paper reviews the consequences of river modification to lower Mississippi River floodplain, current efforts towards restoring the floodplain and deltaic plain, and proposes future strategies towards restoring portions of the historical floodplain.",2016,,"FISHERY RESOURCES, ENVIRONMENT, AND CONSERVATION IN THE MISSISSIPPI AND YANGTZE (CHANGJIANG) RIVER BASINS",84,,235-262,WOS:000381782500012,,,#19738,Eggleton 2016,,,https://doi.org/nan,Cairo,Illinois,Gulf of Mexico,,
Modelling of saline intrusion in a long sea outfall with two risers,"Shannon, NR; Mackinnon, PA; Hamill, GA","The quality of coastal waters is affected to a large degree by the dilution and dispersion of wastewater discharged through marine outfalls. Under intermittent or low flows, normal operation of these outfalls is often inhibited by the occurrence of stratified flow and saline intrusion, a phenomenon which results in partial blockage of the system.Having established the validity of a numerical model to predict the main features of stratified flow in an outfall of simple geometry under laminar conditions, further tests were designed to prove its performance under more onerous conditions. The development, results and conclusions from these tests are reported in the current paper.Numerical and experimental tests were carried out using a scale model outfall discharging freshwater into ambient saline water. The tests used two risers in order to generate saline intrusion, where multi-port diffusers are persistently ingressed by saline water.The stratified flow within the long sea outfall was modelled in two dimensions under turbulent conditions, utilising a species model with two fluids (or species) physically interacting on a molecular level.The numerical data provided quantitative evidence of the fundamental mechanisms that take place when saline water enters the outfall diffuser. The comparisons of numerical and experimental results verified the capability of the numerical model to reproduce the main hydrodynamic processes that give rise to saline intrusion but also highlighted discrepancies in the more detailed aspects of the fluid behaviour.",2001,,COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN MULTIPHASE FLOW,29,,299-308,WOS:000171058700028,,,#19740,Shannon 2001,,,https://doi.org/nan,,,,,
Note on a Surface-Film Delineated Lateral Front at the Head of a Shallow Tidal Creek,"Uncles, RJ","Lateral surface frontal systems have been observed in the upper reaches of a small, low freshwater runoff, strongly tidal creek. They are a very striking visual feature of this water body when delineated by large quantities of surface film material. The fronts are mostly associated with a creek cross-section of somewhat reduced width and mudflat depth (the 'Ridge') compared with adjacent sections. Images are presented that show the tidal intrusion nature of the front and its subsequent development and final down-creek movement as a buoyant plume. Longitudinal and vertical surveys of salinity during a mean-range tide demonstrate the strong stratification that exists in this shallow water body, which, at high water (HW), is typically 1-2 m deep in the narrow main channel. Velocity measurements indicate that a critical inflow Froude number is associated with the initial formation stage of the front. Subsequent frontal locations and behaviour qualitatively correspond to the relative balance between tidal current and surface-layer buoyancy current speeds. Vertical profiling data and bed-mounted salinity sensors during a strong spring tide with low freshwater runoff demonstrate only minor surface stratification and layering on the flood. Nevertheless, the inflow Froude number exceeds unity at the Ridge at peak flood, which is indicative of up-creek frontal formation, and a strongly stratified plume propagates through the Ridge section on the ebb.",2023,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,,,,WOS:000921785700001,10.1007/s12237-022-01153-y,,#19763,Uncles 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-022-01153-y,,,,,
"Stratigraphic controls on seawater intrusion and implications for groundwater management, Dominguez Gap area of Los Angeles, California, USA","Nishikawa, T; Siade, AJ; Reichard, EG; Ponti, DJ; Canales, AG; Johnson, TA","Groundwater pumping has led to extensive water-level declines and seawater intrusion in coastal Los Angeles, California (USA). A SUTRA-based solute-transport model was developed to test the hydraulic implications of a sequence-stratigraphic model of the Dominguez Gap area and to assess the effects of water-management scenarios. The model is two-dimensional, vertical and follows an approximate flow line extending from the Pacific Ocean through the Dominguez Gap area. Results indicate that a newly identified fault system can provide a pathway for transport of seawater and that a stratigraphic boundary located between the Bent Spring and Upper Wilmington sequences may control the vertical movement of seawater. Three 50-year water-management scenarios were considered: (1) no change in water-management practices; (2) installation of a slurry wall; and (3) raising inland water levels to 7.6 m above sea level. Scenario 3 was the most effective by reversing seawater intrusion. The effects of an instantaneous 1-m sea-level rise were also tested using water-management scenarios 1 and 3. Results from two 100-year simulations indicate that a 1-m sea-level rise may accelerate seawater intrusion for scenario 1; however, scenario 3 remains effective for controlling seawater intrusion.",2009,,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,17,7,1699-1725,WOS:000270980700012,10.1007/s10040-009-0481-8,,#19769,Nishikawa 2009,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0481-8,Los Angeles,California,Dominguez,Upper,
"Climate-induced interannual variability and projected change of two harmful algal bloom taxa in Chesapeake Bay, USA","Li, M; Ni, WF; Zhang, F; Glibert, PM; Lin, CH","Retrospective analysis of water quality monitoring data reveals strong interannual shifts in the spatial distribution of two harmful algal species (Prorocentrum minimum and Karlodinium veneficum) in eutrophic Chesapeake Bay. A habitat model, based on the temperature and salinity tolerance of the two species as well as their nutrient preferences, provides a good interpretation for the observed seasonal progression and spatial distribution of these taxa. It also points to climate-induced variability in the hydrological forcing as a mechanism driving the interannual shifts in the algal distributions: both P. minimum and K. veneficum shift downstream during wetter years but upstream during dry years. Climate downscaling simulations using the habitat model show upstream shifts of the two species in the estuary and longer blooming seasons by the mid-21st century. Salt intrusion due to sea level rise will raise salinity in the estuary and cause these HAB species to migrate upstream, but increasing winter-spring flows may also drive favorable salinity habitat downstream. Warming leads to longer growing seasons of P. minimum and K. veneficum but may suppress bloom habitat during their respective peak bloom periods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial Community Response to Seawater Amendment in Low-Salinity Tidal Sediments,"Edmonds, JW; Weston, NB; Joye, SB; Mou, XZ; Moran, MA","Rising sea levels and excessive water withdrawals upstream are making previously freshwater coastal ecosystems saline. Plant and animal responses to variation in the freshwater-saline interface have been well studied in the coastal zone; however, microbial community structure and functional response to seawater intrusion remains relatively unexplored. Here, we used molecular approaches to evaluate the response of the prokaryotic community to controlled changes in porewater salinity levels in freshwater sediments from the Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. This work is a companion to a previously published study describing results from an experiment using laboratory flow-through sediment core bioreactors to document biogeochemical changes as porewater salinity was increased from 0 to 10 over 35 days. As reported in Weston et al. (Biogeochemistry, 77:375-408, 62), porewater chemistry was monitored, and cores were sacrificed at 0, 9, 15, and 35 days, at which time we completed terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16S rRNA clone library analyses of sediment microbial communities. The biogeochemical study documented changes in mineralization pathways in response to artificial seawater additions, with a decline in methanogenesis, a transient increase in iron reduction, and finally a dominance of sulfate reduction. Here, we report that, despite these dramatic and significant changes in microbial activity at the biogeochemical level, no significant differences were found between microbial community composition of control vs. seawater-amended treatments for either Bacterial or Archaeal members. Further, taxa in the seawater-amended treatment community did not become more ""marine-like"" through time. Our experiment suggests that, as seawater intrudes into freshwater sediments, observed changes in metabolic activity and carbon mineralization on the time scale of weeks are driven more by shifts in gene expression and regulation than by changes in the composition of the microbial community.",2009,,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,58,3,558-568,WOS:000269928300012,10.1007/s00248-009-9556-2,,#19807,Edmonds 2009,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-009-9556-2,Georgia,USA,Weston,,
"Hurricane Harvey Storm Sedimentation in the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge, Texas: Fluvial Versus Storm Surge Deposition","Yao, Q; Liu, KB; Williams, H; Joshi, S; Bianchette, TA; Ryu, J; Dietz, M","Few studies have documented the characteristics of fluvial flooding-induced storm deposits associated with a modern hurricane. Hurricane Harvey (2017) caused extensive flooding in coastal Texas due to a combination of storm surge and heavy precipitation. This study investigates the depositional process associated with Hurricane Harvey by means of loss-on-ignition (LOI) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses of 9 short cores and 17 surface samples collected from the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge (SBNWR), Texas. Hurricane Harvey caused the largest flood within SBNWR over the last 28 years, and freshwater flooding from the San Bernard River was the predominant cause of this inundation. A distinct washover sand layer is lacking at all coring sites, but the intrusion of seawater can still be detected by a peak in the chlorine/bromine (Cl/Br) ratio of most sediment cores. Our study shows that Cl/Br ratios are higher in coastal environments than in terrestrial environments, thereby confirming that this elemental ratio can be used as a salinity indicator and, as a corollary, evidence of marine intrusion into lower-salinity environments. The ensuing phase of freshwater flooding and fluvial sedimentation is represented by a distinct flood deposit in only three cores, but is absent or indistinct in most cores. The elusiveness of the Harvey fluvial flood deposit can be explained by the relatively low discharge and suspended sediment load of the San Bernard River, the uneven distribution of this event deposit, and its indistinctiveness with the underlying deposits laid down by previous flood events.",2020,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,43,5,971-983,WOS:000537511500004,10.1007/s12237-019-00639-6,,#19812,Yao 2020,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00639-6,Texas,,,,
Tidal intrusion within a mega delta: An unstructured grid modelling approach,"Bricheno, LM; Wolf, J; Islam, S","The finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM) has been applied to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal in order to simulate tidal hydrodynamics and freshwater flow in a complex river system. The delta region is data-poor in observations of both bathymetry and water level; making it a challenge for accurate hydrodynamic models be configured for and validated in this area. This is the first 3D baroclinic model covering the whole GBM delta from deep water beyond the shelf break to 250 km inland, the limit of tidal penetration.This paper examines what controls tidal penetration from the open coast into an intricate system of river channels. A modelling approach is used to improve understanding of the hydrodynamics of the GBM delta system. Tidal penetration is controlled by a combination of bathymetry, channel geometry, bottom friction, and river flow. The simulated tides must be validated before this delta model is used further to investigate baroclinic processes, river salinity and future change in this area. The performance of FVCOM tidal model configuration is evaluated at a range of sites in order to assess its ability to capture water levels which vary over both a tidal and seasonal cycle.FVCOM is seen to capture the leading tidal constituents well at coastal tide gauge stations, with small root-mean-squared errors of 10 cm on average. Inland, the model compares favourably with twice daily observed water levels at thirteen stations where it is able to capture both tidal and annual timescales in the estuarine system. When the river discharge is particularly strong, the tidal range can be reduced as the tide and river are in direct competition.The bathymetry is found to be the most influential control on water levels within the delta, though tidal penetration can be significantly affected by the model's bottom roughness, and the inclusion of large river discharge. We discuss the generic problem of implementing a model in a data-poor region and the challenge of validating a hydrodynamic model from the open coast to narrow river channels. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The transition of a freshwater karst aquifer to an anoxic marine system,"Garman, KM; Garey, JR","Jewfish Sink is located in the shallow seagrass flats of the Gulf of Mexico in west central Florida. Jewfish Sink was a submarine spring until the drought of 1961-1962 when it ceased flowing. Today, the sink is an anaerobic marine basin and provides the opportunity to study the implications of saltwater intrusion in coastal karstic areas. The biogeochemistry of Jewfish Sink was studied from summer 2001 through spring 2004. A distinct feature of the sink is the uniform cold temperature (16-17 degrees C) of the deeper anoxic water that does not match groundwater found nearshore or onshore (22-24 degrees C). There are four zones within the sink: oxic zone, transition zone, upper anoxic zone, and anoxic bottom water. The anoxic bottom water does not mix with water from above but may be linked to deep Gulf shelf water through ancient aquifer conduits. The other three zones vary seasonally in oxygen, salinity, and temperature because of limited mixing in the winter due to cooling and sinking of surface water. The walls of the anoxic zones have characteristic microbial mats that are found in other sulfidic karstic features in the area. Bacterial activity appears to be carbon limited in the anoxic zones where sulfate reduction appears to be the major metabolic process. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide appears to be driven by irregular influxes of organic matter including macroalgae, horseshoe crabs, and stingrays that become entrapped within the sink. Bacterial activity in the oxic zones appears to be phosphate limited. Although the system is partially isolated from the overlying marine ecosystem, organic input from above drives the bacterial anaerobic ecosystem, resulting in a sulfide pump. In this model, sulfide percolates up through the karst and removes oxygen from the overlying sediment, which has likely caused changes in the shallow benthic ecosystem. Jewfish Sink appears to be part of an extensive anoxic subterranean estuary that extends under parts of at least three coastal counties in Florida and can serve as a model for the effects of rising sea levels or aquifer mining.",2005,,ESTUARIES,28,5,686-693,WOS:000233418600005,,,#19826,Garman 2005,,,https://doi.org/nan,Florida,macroalgae,karst,,
The influence of density fronts on sediment dynamics within river-to-sea estuarine transitional waters,"Duck, RW","The interaction of river-borne suspended and bedload sediments with marine-derived sediments is complicated by the sharply defined lateral and transverse water density gradients of frontal systems that characterise many estuaries worldwide. These features, often recognised at the water surface as linear bands of foam or flotsam, develop principally due to tidal intrusion, axial convergence, longitudinal shearing and flow separation. However, knowledge of the relationships of such features with bathymetry is still poorly developed. Not only do frontal systems impact upon intra-water column fine particulate transport by entrapment and compartmentalisation, they also exert a control on the distribution of bedforms and bottom sediment grain size distributions, thereby delimiting often closely juxtaposed, but differing bottom current velocity fields on the ebb and flood tidal phases. In consequence, fronts are now considered as ""sieves"" within the transitional river-to-sea, estuarine sediment transfer system; this perception has been reinforced by numerical study of lateral grain size sorting.",2010,,SEDIMENT DYNAMICS FOR A CHANGING FUTURE,337,,220-223,WOS:000309505900028,,,#19853,Duck 2010,,,https://doi.org/nan,,,,,
MANGROVES AND CLIMATE-CHANGE IN THE FLORIDA AND CARIBBEAN REGION - SCENARIOS AND HYPOTHESES,"SNEDAKER, SC","The principal scenario concerning the potential effects of climate change on mangrove forest communities revolves around sealevel rise with emphases on coastal abandonment and inland retreat attributable to flooding and saline intrusion. However, at the decade to century scale, changes in precipitation and catchment runoff may be a more significant factor at the regional level. Specifically, for any given sealevel elevation it is hypothesized that reduced rainfall and runoff would necessarily result in higher salinity and greater seawater-sulfate exposure. This would likely be associated with decreased production and increased sediment organic matter decomposition leading to subsidence. In contrast, higher rainfall and runoff would result in reduced salinity and exposure to sulfate, and also increase the delivery of terrigenous nutrients. Consequently, mangrove production would increase and sediment elevations would be maintained. Support for this scenario derives from studies of the high production in saline mangrove impoundments which are depleted in seawater sulfate. This paper also examines other components of climate change, such as UVb, temperature, and storm frequency, and presents a suite of hypotheses and analytical protocols to encourage scientific discussion and testing.",1995,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,295,1-3,43-49,WOS:A1995QH48700007,10.1007/BF00029109,,#19887,SNEDAKER 1995,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00029109,,,,,
Structure and composition of oligohaline marsh plant communities exposed to salinity pulses,"Howard, RJ; Mendelssohn, IA","The response of two oligohaline marsh macrophyte communities to pulses of increased salinity was studied over a single growing season in a greenhouse experiment. The plant communities were allowed a recovery period in freshwater following the pulse events. The experimental treatments included: (1) salinity influx rate (rate of salinity increase from 0 to 12 g l(-1)); (2) duration of exposure to elevated salinity; and (3) water depth. The communities both included Sagittaria lancifolia L,; the codominant species were Eleocharis palustris (L.) Roemer and J.A. Schultes in community 1 and Schoenoplectus americanus (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz and R. Keller in community 2. Effects of the treatments on sediment chemical characteristics (salinity, pH, redox potential, and sulfide and ammonium concentrations) and plant community attributes (aboveground and belowground biomass, stem density, leaf tissue nutrients, and species richness) were examined.The treatment effects often interacted to influence sediment and plant communities characteristics following recovery in fresh water. Salinity influx rate per se, however, had little effect on the abiotic or biotic response variables; significant influx effects were found when the 0 g l(-1) (zero influx) treatment was compared to the 12 g l(-1) treatments, regardless of the rate salinity was raised. A salinity level of 12 g l(-1) had negative effects on plant community structure and composition; these effects were usually associated with 3 months of salinity exposure. Water depth often interacted with exposure duration, but increased water depth did independently decrease the values of some community response measures.Community 1 was affected more than community 2 in the most extreme salinity treatment (3 months exposure/15-cm water depth). Although species richness in both communities was reduced, structural changes were more dramatic in community 1. Biomass and stem density were reduced in community 1 overall and in both dominant species. Structural changes in community 2 consisted of reduced biomass and stem density in the community overall and in S. lancifolia; S. americanus was not affected by salinity. in this most extreme treatment, community 2 tended to change to a monospecific S. americanus stand while community 1 was reduced to a few surviving stems of secondary species. Our results suggest that vegetation recovery or establishment of new species following a temporary increase in soil water salinity will vary with exposure duration and water depth.

Coastal Resiliency Groundwater Considerations,"Rozell, DJ","The potential for rising groundwater is an important consideration in any coastal resiliency assessment. Unlike other groundwater modeling that focuses mostly on contaminant tracking, coastal groundwater resiliency assessments are primarily concerned with the potential for groundwater emergence induced by sea level rise.

Experimental Investigation of the Effects of Revetments on Seawater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers,"Lee, WD; Yoo, YJ; Jeong, YM; Jeong, YH; Hur, DS","Sea level rise due to global warming and the decline in groundwater levels due to the misuse of groundwater resources can decrease the seawater and groundwater pressure gradient, which can, in turn, increase seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. Many researchers have conducted theoretical, experimental, and numerical analyses on the effects of changes in seawater and groundwater levels on coastal aquifers. In this study, modeling experiments were conducted in a sandy tank to analyze revetment and underground obstacles that influence seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. We focused on areas that have not been examined by current research. We confirmed that as the gradient of the seawater level to groundwater level increased, seawater intrusion weakened, because the difference between the seawater and groundwater levels increased as the salinity difference between the seawater and freshwater decreased. Following the installation of a revetment in the experimental coastal aquifer, the groundwater level behind it increased. Due to a decrease in the cross-sectional area, a special seawater-freshwater interface formed. We found that the seawater-groundwater pressure gradient increased due to the revetment, the flow to the sea increased, and the seawater-freshwater boundary moved in the direction of the sea in the experimental tank. This study suggests that if revetment and similar underground obstacles are arranged appropriately, the groundwater level and groundwater flow can be changed, and seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers can be reduced. In the future, results from this experiment could be used by numerical models as verification data for the seawater-freshwater interface and the seawater intrusion distance.",2018,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,441-445,WOS:000441173100089,10.2112/SI85-089.1,,#19911,Lee 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.2112/SI85-089.1,,,,,
Modeling the intrusion of the Loop Current into the Gulf of Mexico,"Lugo-Fernandez, A","The Loop Current (LC) intrusion into the Gulf of Mexico is analyzed using steady, 2-D nonlinear shallow water equations expressed in Cartesian and natural coordinates. The model suggests that the LC moves with constant relative vorticity along isopleths of the Bernoulli function B such that its surface area (A) has a steady dA/dt and frontal velocity. The intrusion is envisioned as an initial transport imbalance that creates volume storage within the Gulf. Because of the advection of relative vorticity, the intruding inflow splits into a northward flow on the west and a southward flow on the east. The storage creates a sea level difference across the LC that induces a northward force due to Coriolis. This force reinforces the northward flow but opposes the southward flow, helping store water inside the Gulf. This sea level difference is in addition to the one in the B field. The storage implies loss of kinetic energy, which creates a speed shear across the LC and gives rise to the small speed of the LC front. The relative vorticity equation in natural coordinates reveals three aspects of the LC: (1) a velocity difference across the LC, (2) a parabolic shape of the sea surface; and (3) a negative curvature of the LC meaning the velocity changes direction anticyclonically along the B-contours.",2018,,DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS,84,,46-54,WOS:000452584400005,10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2018.10.003,,#19932,Lugo-Fernandez 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2018.10.003,Coriolis,,,,
Analytical analysis of the temporal asymmetry between seawater intrusion and retreat,"Rathore, SS; Zhao, Y; Lu, CH; Luo, J","The quantification of timescales associated with the movement of the seawater-freshwater interface is useful for developing effective management strategies for controlling seawater intrusion (SWI). In this study, for the first time, we derive an explicit analytical solution for the timescales of SWI and seawater retreat (SWR) in a confined, homogeneous coastal aquifer system under the quasi-steady assumption, based on a classical sharp-interface solution for approximating freshwater outflow rates into the sea. The flow continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface are identified as two primary mechanisms governing timescales of the interface movement driven by an abrupt change in discharge rates or hydraulic heads at the inland boundary. Through theoretical analysis, we quantified the dependence of interface-movement timescales on porosity, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, aquifer length, density ratio, and boundary conditions. Predictions from the analytical solution closely agreed with those from numerical simulations. In addition, we define a temporal asymmetry index ( the ratio of the SWI timescale to the SWR timescale) to represent the resilience of the coastal aquifer in response to SWI. The developed analytical solutions provide a simple tool for the quick assessment of SWI and SWR timescales and reveal that the temporal asymmetry between SWI and SWR mainly relies on the initial and final values of the freshwater flux at the inland boundary, and is weakly affected by aquifer parameters. Furthermore, we theoretically examined the log-linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary, and found that the relationship may be approximated by two linear functions with a slope of -2 and -1 for large changes at the boundary flux for SWI and SWR, respectively.",2018,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,111,,121-131,WOS:000418592800010,10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.001,,#19944,Rathore 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.001,,,,,

It is estimated that 0.86 million hectares of land currently under fallow in the dry season would be suitable for wheat production using varieties with enhanced salt tolerance. This study investigated the impact of salt tolerance Nax genes (Na+ exclusion) on the grain yield of bread wheat grown on saline soils in southern Bangladesh. Nax1 and Nax2 genes were separately crossed into two Bangladeshi bread wheat varieties, BARI Gom 25 and BARI Gom 26, through conventional crossing with marker-assisted selection. The key outcome was strong evidence that both Nax genes have the capacity to lower leaf Na+ concentration in locally adapted bread wheat and consequently deliver improved yields in challenging field environments in southern Bangladesh with moderate to high salinity. The genetic backgrounds of the adapted varieties played a significant role in the expression of these genes. There was a differential response in the phenotypic expression of Nax genes to reduce leaf Na+ levels between the two local varieties selected as recurrent parents and the resultant variation in yield. The average reduction in leaf Na+ concentrations from the third backcrossed lines in the BARI Gom 25 background was about twice that of lines in the BARI Gom 26 background. These same lines typically yielded between 10% and 20% higher than BARI Gom 25 on moderate to high salinity sites, whereas the backcrossed lines in the BARI Gom 26 background yielded similarly to their recurrent parent at these same sites. The contrast in the differential phenotypic expression of the Nax genes evident in the two recurrent parents represented in this study highlights the importance of crossing salt tolerance Nax genes into a range of locally adapted high-yielding genetic backgrounds to identify the greatest potential for improvement in salt tolerance.",2023,,JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE,,,,WOS:000965271400001,10.1111/jac.12643,,#19957,James 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jac.12643,Bangladesh,,,,
Beach nourishment has complex implications for the future of sandy shores,"de Schipper, MA; Ludka, BC; Raubenheimer, B; Luijendijk, AP; Schlacher, TA","Beach nourishment - the addition of sand to increase the width or sand volume of the beach - is a widespread coastal management technique to counteract coastal erosion. Globally, rising sea levels, storms and diminishing sand supplies threaten beaches and the recreational, ecosystem, groundwater and flood protection services they provide. Consequently, beach nourishment practices have evolved from focusing on maximizing the time sand stays on the beach to also encompassing human safety and water recreation, groundwater dynamics and ecosystem impacts. In this Perspective, we present a multidisciplinary overview of beach nourishment, discussing physical aspects of beach nourishment alongside ecological and socio-economic impacts. The future of beach nourishment practices will vary depending on local vulnerability, sand availability, financial resources, government regulations and efficiencies, and societal perceptions of environmental risk, recreational uses, ecological conservation and social justice. We recommend co-located, multidisciplinary research studies on the combined impacts of nourishments, and explorations of various designs to guide these globally diverse nourishment practices.Beach nourishment is a well-established engineering practice to slow erosion and maintain or expand sandy beaches, but sea level rise, diminishing sand resources and recreational, groundwater and ecological concerns require new assessments and designs of this coastal management technique.

Mitigation of salinity intrusion in well-mixed estuaries by optimization of freshwater diversion rates,"Sanders, BF; Piasecki, M","The diversion of fresh water from estuaries for agricultural and municipal uses leads to an upstream shift in the brackish water zone that can disrupt ecosystems and deteriorate water quality at downstream points. Models are routinely used to predict hydrodynamic and water quality conditions in estuaries, and presented here is a modeling approach that ultimately could prove helpful in designing strategies to divert fresh water while mitigating changes in salinity further downstream. An optimization problem is formulated whereby a least-squares function of the salinity distribution predicted by the model is minimized by optimizing a parameter vector describing the diversion rate as a function of time. The optimization method is shown to rapidly identify diversion schedules in a range of test systems. Optimization is performed by a quasi-Newton method that utilizes a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno update, and an adjoint sensitivity method is formulated and applied to evaluate the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameter vector. The sensitivity of salinity levels to diversion rates is predicted to have both intratidal and intertidal variability, giving insight into the potential for diversions at any given time and any location along an estuary to have either a rapid or longer-term effect on the salinity distribution. The controllability of salinity levels by fresh-water diversions is directly related to these sensitivities.",2002,,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,128,1,64-77,WOS:000173366700007,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2002)128:1(64),,#19969,Sanders 2002,,,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2002)128:1(64),,,,,
"Upriver transport of dissolved substances in an estuary and sub-estuary system of the lower James River, Chesapeake Bay","Hong, B; Shen, J; Xu, HZ","The water exchange between the James River and the Elizabeth River, an estuary and sub-estuary system in the lower Chesapeake Bay, was investigated using a 3D numerical model. The conservative passive tracers were used to represent the dissolved substances (DS) discharged from the Elizabeth River. The approach enabled us to diagnose the underlying physical processes that control the expansion of the DS, which is representative of potential transport of harmful algae blooms, pollutants from the Elizabeth River to the James River without explicitly simulating biological processes. Model simulations with realistic forcings in 2005, together with a series of processoriented numerical experiments, were conducted to explore the correlations of the transport process and external forcing. Model results show that the upriver transport depends highly on the freshwater discharge on a seasonal scale and maximum upriver transport occurs in summer with a mean transport time ranging from 15-30 days. The southerly/easterly wind, low river discharge, and neap tidal condition all act to strengthen the upriver transport. On the other hand, the northerly/westerly wind, river pulse, water level pulse, and spring tidal condition act to inhibit the upriver transport. Tidal flushing plays an important role in transporting the DS during spring tide, which shortens the travel time in the lower James River. The multivariable regression analysis of volume mean subtidal DS concentration in the mesohaline portion of the James River indicates that DS concentration in the upriver area can be explained and well predicted by the physical forcings (r = 0.858, p = 0.00001).",2018,,FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE,12,3,583-599,WOS:000444389400011,10.1007/s11707-017-0684-6,,#20001,Hong 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11707-017-0684-6,,,,,

Despite the potentially crucial role of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves in tree survival, their dynamics in the process of death under seawater exposure are unknown. Here we monitored progressive tree mortality and associated NSC storage in Sitka-spruce (Picea sitchensis) trees dying under ecosystem-scale increases in seawater exposure in western Washington, USA. All trees exposed to seawater, because of monthly tidal intrusion, experienced declining crown foliage during the sampling period, and individuals with a lower percentage of live foliated crown (PLFC) died faster. Tree PLFC was strongly correlated with subsurface salinity and needle ion contents. Total NSC concentrations in trees declined remarkably with crown decline, and reached extremely low levels at tree death (2.4% and 1.6% in leaves and branches, respectively, and 0.4% in stems and roots). Starch in all tissues was almost completely consumed, while sugars remained at a homeostatic level in foliage. The decreasing NSC with closer proximity to death and near zero starch at death are evidences that carbon starvation occurred during Sitka-spruce mortality during seawater exposure.

Acoustic Monitoring of Tidal Flow and Salinity in a Tidal Channel,"Nguyen, HT; Kawanisi, K; Al Sawaf, MB","Fluvial Acoustic Tomography (FAT) is a powerful hydroacoustic system used in the investigations of estuarine dynamics. This research was designed to explore the effectiveness of using a novel and promising method of monitoring the continuous salinity intrusion and velocity distribution in a tidal channel using the FAT scheme. Four FAT units were installed near the riverbanks using a new zigzag system in a rectangular tomographic domain of 700 m x 170 m. The water velocities and salinities measured by FAT in this study were comparable to the data captured by traditional methods, including moving-boat Stream-Pro ADCP, CTD, and CT sensors. It was found that the delays in time between the maximum salinity and high water level along the channel ranged from 12 min to 1.5 h, with these time lags increasing seaward, primarily due to changes in freshwater flows upstream. In addition, the longitudinal salinity gradient was found to decrease toward the mouth of the river, with tide-driven mechanisms most likely being dominant in the dispersion process. The estuary is ebb-dominant, with an asymmetry in the ebb-tide and flood-tide velocities and the highest velocities occurring during the ebb tide.

When a hurricane travels on the land side, however, it may induce high storm surges, strong currents and destratification in the water column. Real-time observations and numerical model prediction both show a slab-like sloshing in Chesapeake Bay when it was hit by Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. Strong southeasterly winds in the right front quadrant of the storm forced water in Chesapeake Bay to move northward as a single layer, producing high sea levels and flooding in the northern Bay region including Baltimore and Annapolis. Furthermore, the strong landward winds erased water-column stratification and caused a strong intrusion of high-salinity shelf water into the Bay.

Unusual larval abundance of Scyllarides nodifer and Albunea sp during an intrusion of low-salinity Mississippi flood water in the Florida keys in September 1993: Insight into larval transport from upstream,"Yeung, C; Criales, MM; Lee, TN","A massive intrusion of low-salinity water (salinity = 31-35) from the Mississippi River to the Florida Keys in September 1993 coincided with an unusual abundance of the phyllosoma larvae (stages IV-VII) of a slipper lobster, Scyllarides nodifer, and the zoeae (stages III-V) of a sand crab, Albunea sp. These species are abundant in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, but their adults and early stage larvae are not common in the Florida Keys. The influx of S. nodifer and Albunea sp. larvae into the Florida Keys is believed to have originated on the northeastern Gulf of Mexico shelf. The southward transport of the larvae within a low-salinity plume from the Mississippi River was apparently caused by anomalous eastward winds moving shelf waters into the Loop Current, which had extended to within similar to 170 km of the Mississippi Delta. During normal-salinity conditions (salinity > 36) the spiny lobster Panulirus argus is the most numerous species of phyllosoma larvae in the coastal waters of the Florida Keys. A wide range of stages of P. argus is present year-round in the Florida Keys, suggesting multiple larval sources upstream possibly in the Yucatan Peninsula and the Caribbean. In contrast, the source of S. nodifer and Albunea sp, recruits for the Florida Keys may lie principally in the northeastern gulf. The recruitment success of larvae of gulf origin to the Florida Keys may depend partly on the coincidence of specific wind and Loop Current transport conditions with an availability of larvae for expatriation at the source.",2000,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,105,C12,28741-28758,WOS:000166208800015,10.1029/1999JC000269,,#20050,Yeung 2000,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/1999JC000269,Albunea,,,,
Groundwater use and salinization with grassland afforestation,"Jobbagy, EG; Jackson, RB","Vegetation changes, particularly transitions between tree- and grass-dominated states, can alter ecosystem water balances and soluble salt fluxes. Here we outline a general predictive framework for understanding salinization of afforested grasslands based on biophysical, hydrologic, and edaphic factors. We tested this framework in 20 paired grassland and adjacent afforested plots across ten sites in the Argentine Pampas. Rapid salinization of groundwater and soils in afforested plots was associated with increased evapotranspiration and groundwater consumption by trees, with maximum salinization occurring on intermediately textured soils. Afforested plots (10-100 ha in size) showed 4-19-fold increases in groundwater salinity on silty upland soils but <twofold increases on clay loess soils and sand dunes. Two years of salinity and groundwater measurements at a 40 ha Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation revealed that the plantation reduced groundwater recharge, underwent groundwater discharge on >50% of the days, and depressed the water table 38 cm on average compared to the adjacent grassland. Soil cores and vertical electrical soundings indicated that approximate to6 kg m(-2) of salts accumulated close to the water table and suggested that salinization resulted from the exclusion of fresh groundwater solutes by tree roots. Groundwater use with afforestation in the Pampas and in other regions around the world can enhance primary production and provide a tool for flood control. However, our framework and experimental data also suggest that afforestation can compromise the quality of soils and water resources in predictable ways based on water use, climate, and soil texture.",2004,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,10,8,1299-1312,WOS:000222869600006,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00806.x,,#20061,Jobbagy 2004,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00806.x,,,,,
Climate change and water supply: governance and adaptation planning in Florida,"Maliva, RG; Manahan, WS; Missimer, TM","Florida has been described as 'ground zero' for climate change in the United States with coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and water supplies under threat from saline-water intrusion, changes in precipitation amounts and patterns, and temperature-driven increases in demands. Water utilities and regional suppliers are responsible for their own water supply plans and adaptation strategies, which are developed largely by a relatively small group of technical specialists (internal and contracted). Water supply planning is prescribed by the state water governance system and local community planning processes. The degree of engagement of large coastal communities and water utilities and regional water suppliers in Florida with climate change research is generally high. Climate change-induced impacts to water supplies and demands over the common 20-year planning horizon are likely to be small relative to increases in demand caused by projected on-going population growth and normal climatic variation. Water utilities in Florida have been incidentally moving toward more climate-resilient supplies (e.g., brackish groundwater desalination) due to the unavailability of additional permittable, inexpensive fresh groundwater rather than climate change concerns.

A numerical study of barotropicly forced intrusion in DeSoto Canyon,"Yuan, DL","[1] The intrusion of open ocean water across the head of DeSoto Canyon offshore of Pensacola, Florida, is investigated using a version of the Bryan-Cox model of the entire Gulf of Mexico. The Loop Current-forced model circulation in DeSoto Canyon features an eastward, nearly along-isobath, current with a weak cross-isobath velocity component. In contrast, the southward wind-driven currents over the west Florida shelf in response to northerly winds induce strong cross-isobath flow at the head of DeSoto Canyon. The flow is diagnosed to be the bottom Ekman flow associated with the strong along-isobath currents. In addition, transient responses of sea levels to the northerly wind bursts give rise to pressure gradient-forced currents up the canyon during the collapse phase of the winds.

We conducted a dendroecology study across six sites in western Washington, USA, to examine how tree growth, gas exchange (indexed by basal area increment (BAI) and wood delta C-13 respectively), and survival varies with seawater exposure through two approaches. First, tree core samples were collected at a site where seawater exposure started only 4 years prior to sampling, which allowed a cause-and-effect test of the impacts of seawater exposure on trees, and second, samples were collected at five additional sites where we compared downstream to upstream trees under current sea-level conditions. At the seawater intrusion site, BAI and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in the year of intrusion (2014) and stayed unchanged thereafter. Four years later (2018), the percentage of recently standing dead trees in the forest was 73.0% of the basal area. Across the regional assessment, percentage of standing dead trees was significantly greater in downstream than upstream forests at five of the six sites (averaged 37.7 +/- 11.0% and 4.3 +/- 2.1% basal area for downstream and upstream, respectively). Growth was significantly lower (p < 0.01) at the downstream than upstream for five sites, and Delta was lower for all needle-leaf trees (three sites) on the downstream compared to the upstream, but no difference was observed between downstream and upstream for broad-leaf trees (three sites).

Core and surface soil samples were collected in both the residential and wetland sites and then analyzed by field portable X-ray fluorescence (NITON XL3t-600 series FP-XRF). Pore-water salinity was determined from continuous measurements (every 10 min) of conductivity in a single sampling well installed in the wetland site. One month after Hurricane Sandy, pore-salinity was as high as 27 g/L, but gradually decreased to 15 g/L in approximately 3 months. Then, it increased gradually to 26 g/L 3 months later. High metal concentrations (lead, arsenic, copper, chromium, and iron) were measured in the surface and top 2-cm soil layer in both residential and wetland sites, often exceeding background levels within weeks of Hurricane Sandy. These metal contaminations were interpreted as being associated with storm surge from Hurricane Sandy that caused substantial flooding of the coastal areas by large amounts of seawater, loaded with dissolved metal and adsorbed metals to suspended sediments from the Raritan Bay Slag Super-fund site.

The purpose of this study was to determine in the laboratory the rate and percentage of seed germination at different levels of salinity and flooding for the species: Typha domingensis, Sagittaria lancifolia, Ludwigia octovalvis, Pontederia sagittata, Boehmeria cylindrica, Cyperus digitatus and Puirena simplex. Germination tests were conducted in Petri dishes. The treatment consisted of two factors: saturation and salinity. The first factor presented two levels (moist and saturated), and the second factor four levels (freshwater, 5, 10 and 15 ppt). The controlled conditions in the germination chamber were light for 14 hat 25 degrees C and dark for 10 hat 20 degrees C. The results showed that the species germinated faster and had higher germination percentages in the freshwater treatment compared to the more saline conditions. The three most salt-tolerant species were T. domingensis, L. octovalvis and C. digitatus. Additionally, germination was higher under saturated conditions for all species except for B. cylindrica.

Circulation dynamics and salt balance in a lagoonal estuary,"Jia, P; Li, M","Albemarle-Pamlico Sound (APS) is a shallow lagoonal estuary connected to the Atlantic Ocean through narrow inlets. The circulation dynamics and salt balance in this estuary are investigated using a numerical model. Although the vertical stratification is weak, the mean flow features a two-layer gravitational circulation with speeds reaching several centimeters per second. Analysis of the momentum budget shows a primary balance among the barotropic pressure gradient as a result of sea level slope, the baroclinic pressure gradient due to horizontal salinity gradients, and stress divergence. The salt budget for APS is determined by the balance between river flow and salt exchange through the inlets. At the inlets, the salt flux resulting from estuarine shear flow is much weaker than that due to tidal pumping and subtidal barotropic transport. Tidal pumping produces a net influx of salt into APS: Strong flood currents push oceanic water into the estuary through a propagating density front, whereas ebb currents advect lighter estuarine water over denser bottom water. The salt flux due to the subtidal barotropic transport across the inlets shows large temporal fluctuations associated with wind events. This transport can be either a source or sink of salt to APS and correlates well with the sea level difference across each inlet. Higher-sea level on the shelf leads to an intrusion of oceanic water into APS whereas higher-sea level inside APS leads to a withdrawal of estuarine water to the shelf.",2012,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,117,,,WOS:000298932000001,10.1029/2011JC007124,,#20129,Jia 2012,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007124,,,,,
Saline intrusion with change in tidal range,"Ifuku, M","There have been few studies on salt wedge instability under the influence of tidal motion and the behavior of interfaces and interface instability conditions when tide propagates up rivers. To clarify these phenomena, it is necessary to carry out analysis with a vertical two-dimensional or three-dimensional numerical model. Further, the modeling of tide effects at the upstream boundary is an important issue. We carry out numerical analysis on the saline intrusion caused by propagation of tide, with two-dimensional Reynolds and diffusion equations used as the governing equations. It proves possible to explain the temporal variation of surface level as well as the vertical structure of flow and salinity during flood and ebb tides in the estuary. The location of isohalines changes periodically with variations in tide and depending upon the modified estuarine Richardson number proposed by Fischer.",1999,,"WATER POLLUTION V: MODELLING, MEASURING AND PREDICTION",1,,195-204,WOS:000082821900019,,,#20144,Ifuku 1999,,,https://doi.org/nan,,,,,
Salinization of stream water and groundwater at daily to decadal scales in a temperate climate,"Shattuck, MD; Fazekas, HM; Wymore, AS; Cox, A; McDowell, WH","Elevated salt concentrations in streams draining developed watersheds are well documented, but the effects of hydrologic variability and the role of groundwater in surface water salinization are poorly understood. To characterize these effects, we use long-term data (12-19 yr) and high-frequency specific conductance (SPC) data collected from 13 streams across New Hampshire, USA. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for chloride (Cl-) derived from high-frequency SPC showed distinct seasonal variability. Diluting behavior was common, but flushing behavior occurred in autumn and winter, suggesting that both groundwater and surface runoff contribute salts to streams. Long-term data show that although extreme flood events initially reduced salt concentrations in groundwater and rural streams, concentrations recovered to preflood conditions in about a decade. Chronic Cl- exceedances occurred in urban streams during all seasons. This research suggests that variation in stream flow, extreme events and application of deicing agents play a role in freshwater salinization.",2023,,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS,8,1,131-140,WOS:000911312400001,10.1002/lol2.10306,,#20170,Shattuck 2023,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10306,New Hampshire,USA,,,
Phytoremediation: Climate change resilience and sustainability assessment at a coastal brownfield redevelopment,"O'Connor, D; Zheng, XD; Hou, DY; Shen, ZT; Li, GH; Miao, GF; O'Connell, S; Guo, M","Phytoremediation offers a nature based solution (NBS) for contaminated soil remediation; however, its application under a brownfield redevelopment context has not been well studied. Moreover, climate change could impact large numbers of contaminated sites, yet there remains little research on the potential impacts for remediation. This study examined phytoremediation at a brownfield redevelopment in the San Francisco Bay area, where thousands of cleanup sites are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to determine both primary and secondary impacts and the system's resilience to various sea level scenarios and hydroclimatic conditions was investigated. It was found that the phytoremediation project rendered only a small environmental footprint, and was associated with low cost and substantial socioeconomic benefits. For instance, it fitted well with the site redevelopment setting by offering attractive landscape features. Moreover, under a modeled moderate sea level rise scenario, the groundwater hydraulic gradient at the site decreased, which was coupled with greater natural biodegradation and reduced plume migration, and, therefore, lower life cycle impact. There was also minimal increase in the vapor intrusion risk with increased sea level. Overall, phytoremediation at the site was found to be resilient to a moderate sea level rise and other hydroclimatic effects induced by climate change. However, the system performance responded to increasing sea level rise in a non-linear manner. Under a high sea level rise scenario, the system is predicted to perform abruptly worse.",2019,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,130,,,WOS:000477934800069,10.1016/j.envint.2019.104945,,#20193,O'Connor 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.104945,,,,,
The coupled estuarine-shelf response of a river-dominated system during the transition from low to high discharge,"Dzwonkowski, B; Park, K; Collini, R","Opportunistic observations captured the coupled estuarine-shelf interactions as the Alabama coastal region transitioned from a period of low to flood river discharge conditions. The period of focus was 18 February to 10 April 2011 during which time a combination of in situ (water level, salinity and velocity) and remote sensing (ocean color) data provided information on the estuarine and shelf environment prior to, during, and post a major river discharge event that captured a relatively rare spatially synoptic view of the structural evolution of a discharge plume in response to changing forcing conditions. The discharge event generated major changes in the hydrographic conditions and forcing responses within the estuary and on the shelf. The resulting surface advected plume was observed for approximately two weeks, during which time the observed differences in shelf circulation were directly linked to the discharge plume and a plume bulge with anticyclonic circulation was identified at times throughout the event. The plume was exposed to a range of wind conditions which modulated the surface structure: downwelling winds elongated the plume structure and upwelling winds reversed and widened the plume. The influence of wind forcing, even during very low wind (<3.75 m s(-1)) and large outflow (approximate to 7000 m(3) s(-1)) conditions, was apparent, as a result of the shallow and wide characteristics of the plume. Anticyclonic bulge regions have only been identified in a few systems and the occurrence of this feature on the Alabama shelf has significant implications on transport and fate of river discharge in this region.",2015,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,120,9,6145-6163,WOS:000363470300015,10.1002/2015JC010714,,#20199,Dzwonkowski 2015,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JC010714,Alabama,,,,
Urbanization and aridity mediate distinct salinity response to floods in rivers and streams across the contiguous United States,"Ombadi, M; Varadharajan, C","Salinity is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and the use of freshwaters for industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial purposes. Although a number of studies have investigated the variability and trends of salinity in rivers and streams, the effects of floods on salinity across a wide range of watersheds have not been determined. Here, we examine this question by utilizing long-term observational records of daily streamflow and specific conductance (SC; a proxy for salinity) in addition to catchment characteristics for 259 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites in the contiguous United States spanning a wide range of climatic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. We used a combination of statistical methods, random forest machine learning models, and information-theoretic causal inference algorithms to determine the response of SC to floods and the factors that impact salinity changes within sites (intra-site variability) and across sites (inter-site variability). Our results show that changes to SC during flood events exhibited substantial variability ranging from a 100% decrease to 34% increase relative to the long-term mean. We found that dilution is the prevailing mechanism that decreases SC levels during floods for most sites, but other mechanisms caused an increase of SC for 6.1% (n = 5521) of flood events. Our analysis revealed that antecedent conditions of SC in the few days preceding the flood are the most important factor in explaining intrasite variability. The response of salinity to floods also varied considerably across sites with different characteristics, with a notable effect of urbanization in temperate climates resulting in increased dilution of SC, and mining in arid climates, which adversely increases SC levels. Overall, we find that the combined effect of aridity and anthropogenic factors is of primary importance in determining how salinity responds to floods, and it bears strongly on water quality conditions in a future world - one in which floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity, concurrent with shifting aridity patterns and increasing urbanization.",2022,,WATER RESEARCH,220,,,WOS:000810441600002,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118664,,#20222,Ombadi 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118664,United States,,,,
Exchange Flows in Tributary Creeks Enhance Dispersion by Tidal Trapping,"Garcia, AMP; Geyer, WR; Randall, N","The North River estuary (Massachusetts, USA) is a tidal marsh creek network where tidal dispersion processes dominate the salt balance. A field study using moorings, shipboard measurements, and drone surveys was conducted to characterize and quantify tidal trapping due to tributary creeks. During flood tide, saltwater propagates up the main channel and gets ""trapped"" in the creeks. The creeks inherit an axial salinity gradient from the time-varying salinity at their boundary with the main channel, but it is stronger than the salinity gradient of the main channel because of relatively weaker currents. The stronger salinity gradient drives a baroclinic circulation that stratifies the creeks, while the main channel remains well-mixed. Because of the creeks' shorter geometries, tidal currents in the creeks lead those in the main channel; therefore, the creeks never fill with the saltiest water which passes the main channel junction. This velocity phase difference is enhanced by the exchange flow in the creeks, which fast-tracks the fresher surface layer in the creeks back to the main channel. Through ebb tide, the relatively fresh creek outflows introduce a negative salinity anomaly into the main channel, where it is advected downstream by the tide. Using high-resolution measurements, we empirically determine the salinity anomaly in the main channel resulting from its exchange with the creeks to calculate a dispersion rate due to trapping. Our dispersion rate is larger than theoretical estimates that neglect the exchange flow in the creeks. Trapping contributes more than half the landward salt flux in this region.",2022,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,45,2,363-381,WOS:000673099000001,10.1007/s12237-021-00969-4,,#20235,Garcia 2022,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-021-00969-4,Massachusetts,USA,,,
Salinization of urbanizing New Hampshire streams and groundwater: effects of road salt and hydrologic variability,"Daley, ML; Potter, JD; McDowell, WH","Since the 1940s, use of road salt as a deicing agent has increased substantially in regions of the US with cold winters. Despite its ubiquitous application and known negative consequences for aquatic and human health, little research has documented the effects of road salt on the water quality of either streams or groundwater in regions, such as New Hampshire (NH), with harsh northern climates. We measured stream Na+ and Cl- concentrations in 44 basins spanning a gradient of urbanization in southeastern and central NH. Among all sampled basins, stream Na+ and Cl- concentrations were highly correlated with basin % road pavement (r(2) = 0.75 for Na+, and 0.78 for Cl-). In southeastern NH, concentrations also were correlated strongly with % impervious surface (r(2) = 0.86 for Na+, and 0.92 for Cl-). Groundwater salt concentrations in 143 private wells were significantly correlated with % impervious surface within a 500-m radius of each well, but the proportion of explained variance was small (r(2) = 0.07 for Na+, and 0.10 for Cl-). Concentrations of salt in streams and groundwater were surprisingly high. Mean concentrations of Na+ ranged from <1 to 298 mg/L and of Cl- ranged from <1 to 573 mg/L. Mean Cl- concentration in I small stream exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic toxicity standard of 230 mg/L, and 9% of groundwater samples exceeded the secondary EPA maximum contamination levels for drinking water (250 mg/L of either Na+ or Cl-). In our long-term study basin, the Lamprey River, specific conductance increased over the period from 1978 to 2008, a result that indicated a corresponding increase in Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Both Na+ and Cl- concentrations in the Lamprey River were negatively correlated with flow, but the slope of the relationship decreased after a significant flood in 2006. Our data suggest that road-salting practices are contributing to the salinization of stream water and groundwater in NH, and that hydrologic variability, which is predicted to increase with climate change, could strongly affect the degree of salinization observed in surface waters.",2009,,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,28,4,929-940,WOS:000273886000015,10.1899/09-052.1,,#20252,Daley 2009,,,https://doi.org/10.1899/09-052.1,US,New Hampshire,basin %,Na+,
"Vegetation trends in a restored coastal wetland at Prisoners Harbor, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park","Power, PJ; Denn, M; Wagner, J; Martin, M","Prisoners Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, California, formerly supported a 5-ha wetland and riparian system, the largest on the California Channel Islands. During the late 1800s ranchers filled in about half of the wetland area in order to support ranching activities. They also rerouted the stream channel to the canyon edge and built an earthen berm along its west bank, which disconnected the stream from its floodplain. The National Park Service developed a wetland and riparian restoration design for Prisoners Harbor based on topographic and hydrologic analyses and on vegetation community depth-to-water-table relationships developed from neighboring reference wetlands. In 2011 Channel Islands National Park and The Nature Conservancy restored 1.25 ha of coastal wetlands by removing artificial fill and the earthen berm. Postproject vegetation monitoring during 2012 to 2016 showed increased abundance of 3 of the 8 herbaceous planted wetland species and declines in target invasive species. Severe drought conditions during this window likely influenced vegetation abundance. Postrestoration hydrologic monitoring showed that the restored marsh met the federal wetland hydrology standard only twice: once in late 2011 before the drought began and then again in January-September 2017. An exceptionally large swell and high tide during winter 2015/16 resulted in saltwater flooding of the site; salinity returned to more typical values only slowly after this event. Expansion of wetland species, even during a historic drought and atypical seawater intrusion, suggests that this evidence-basal approach to restoration design will result in functional coastal wetland habitat as more typical precipitation levels return. However, we emphasize the need for aggressive control of nonnative plants until native plant cover is well established.",2019,,WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST,78,4,644-651,WOS:000459312100008,10.3398/064.078.0408,,#20255,Power 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.3398/064.078.0408,Santa Cruz Island,California,west bank,,

Multiyear Trends in Solute Concentrations and Fluxes From a Suburban Watershed: Evaluating Effects of 100-Year Flood Events,"Coble, AA; Wymore, AS; Shattuck, MD; Potter, JD; McDowell, WH","Anthropogenic activities have increased solute concentrations and fluxes in rivers globally. Increases in salt, dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic nutrients have been attributed to changes in atmospheric deposition, road salt and fertilizer application, and urbanization. Extremely large flood events, which are increasing in frequency and duration, could also alter river chemistry by flushing various solute reservoirs within watersheds and effectively resetting the linkages between land and river. We evaluated changes in concentrations and fluxes of inorganic nutrients, dissolved organic matter, and salts and major ions across 12 to 15years in a rural-suburban watershed in New Hampshire, USA. During this period, the human imprint on the landscape (impervious surfaces and population density) increased, but two 100-year flood events also occurred. We found that concentrations and fluxes of chloride and potassium, fluxes of all other major ions, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon declined over time, but concentrations and fluxes of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic nitrogen were unchanged. The minor declines in concentrations were of similar magnitude to declines previously observed in other watersheds that did not experience extreme flood events. We observed a shift in nitrate (NO3-) concentration-discharge behavior from enrichment in the years prior to and including the floods to chemostasis after the floods, but for both time periods NO3- concentrations were weakly related to discharge. Our results suggest a limited role of extreme events in the biogeochemistry of urbanizing watersheds and emphasize the importance of long-term records and multiple analytical approaches to understand the dynamics of complex watersheds.",2018,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,123,9,3072-3087,WOS:000447644800027,10.1029/2018JG004657,,#20269,Coble 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004657,New Hampshire,USA,,,
"Occurrence of Microplastic Pollution at Oyster Reefs and Other Coastal Sites in the Mississippi Sound, USA: Impacts of Freshwater Inflows from Flooding","Scircle, A; Cizdziel, JV; Tisinger, L; Anumol, T; Robey, D","Much of the seafood that humans consume comes from estuaries and coastal areas where microplastics (MPs) accumulate, due in part to continual input and degradation of plastic litter from rivers and runoff. As filter feeders, oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are especially vulnerable to MP pollution. In this study, we assessed MP pollution in water at oyster reefs along the Mississippi Gulf Coast when: (1) historic flooding of the Mississippi River caused the Bonnet Carre Spillway to remain open for a record period of time causing major freshwater intrusion to the area and deleterious impacts on the species and (2) the spillway was closed, and normal salinity conditions resumed. Microplastics (similar to 25 mu m-5 mm) were isolated using a single-pot method, preparing samples in the same vessel (Mason jars) used for their collection right up until the MPs were transferred onto filters for analyses. The MPs were quantified using Nile Red fluorescence detection and identified using laser direct infrared (LDIR) analysis. Concentrations ranged from similar to 12 to 381 particles/L and tended to decrease at sites impacted by major freshwater intrusion. With the spillway open, average MP concentrations were positively correlated with salinity (r = 0.87, p = 0.05) for sites with three or more samples examined. However, the dilution effect on MP abundances was temporary, and oyster yields suffered from the extended periods of lower salinity. There were no significant changes in the relative distribution of MPs during freshwater intrusions; most of the MPs (>50%) were in the lower size fraction (similar to 25-90 mu m) and consisted mostly of fragments (similar to 84%), followed by fibers (similar to 11%) and beads (similar to 5%). The most prevalent plastic was polyester, followed by acrylates/polyurethanes, polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyacetal. Overall, this work provides much-needed empirical data on the abundances, morphologies, and types of MPs that oysters are exposed to in the Mississippi Sound, although how much of these MPs are ingested and their impacts on the organisms deserves further scrutiny.

Louisiana estuarine and coastal fisheries and habitats: Perspectives from a fish's eye view,"Chesney, EJ; Baltz, DM; Thomas, RG","Stimulated by nutrients from the Mississippi River, the vast coastal wetlands of the river's past and present deltas interface with the Gulf of Mexico to form a complex and prolific marine ecosystem. This highly productive system has yielded annual fishery landings of >453.6 x 10(6) kg (1 billion pounds) since 1969. The Louisiana ecosystem has been heavily exploited and significantly altered over the years to meet the demands for coastal development, seafood production, navigation, oil exploration, flood control, and other social, economic, and industrial activities. While not all impacts can be viewed as detrimental to fisheries or their habitat, some of these habitat impacts have contributed to significant ecological problems such as saltwater intrusion, loss of coastal wetlands, and development of vast area of hypoxia along the coast. Management strategies to deal with some of these problems propose directed manipulations of the coastal environments to stop or reduce rates of degradation. Over the past 46 years, fisheries yields from Louisiana waters have remained strong. Although quantitative data are lacking to examine more than a few decades of environmental changes, an analysis of fishery-independent trends for selected inshore species of nekton over a recent 21-yr period suggests that many species have been remarkably resilient to significant changes in their habitats and pressures from exploitation. Over a longer period (60 yr), more significant changes to inshore demersal trawl assemblages are apparent, but data are lacking to conclusively identify their causes or quantitatively document the magnitude of change. We review some of the major changes that have occurred in habitat believed to be essential to fishes and review other factors likely to be significant in structuring fish populations. Given the significant number of environmental impacts affecting the system, we also discuss potential reasons why more dramatic changes in nearshore and estuarine fish populations of coastal Louisiana are not apparent.",2000,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10,2,350-366,WOS:000086008300004,,,#20295,Chesney 2000,,,https://doi.org/nan,Louisiana,,,,
Global Concern for Salinity on Various Agro-Ecosystems,"Mustafa, G; Akhtar, MS; Abdullah, R","Twenty-first century is marked by many challenges regarding agro-ecosystems, such as environmental pollutions, scarcity of water, and increased salinization of soil and water. Population bomb (increasing human population) and reduction in land available for cultivation are two threats to agricultural sustainability. In this situation, demand for cultivable land increases. However, environmental degradation factors such as erratic rainfall, extreme temperatures, drought and floods, high winds, and soil salinity have affected the production and cultivation of agricultural crops. Among these, soil salinity is one of the most devastating environmental stresses, which causes major reductions in cultivated land areas, crop productivity, and quality. Soil salinity further impacts the general public, particularly farmers, through its effect on agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to find the causes of soil salinity and its impact (economic and environmental) on crop production in saline soils given the increasing farming costs.

Spatial-temporal variations in water level and salinity affect species,"Lopez-Rosas, H; Espejel-Gonzalez, VE; Moreno-Casasola, P","The location of the riverine mangroves linked to the constant supply of freshwater favors their productivity and diversity, as well as the main adjacent freshwater wetlands (freshwater swamps, broadleaved marshes, cattail marshes). For this reason, the hydrological connectivity between the mangroves and adjacent wetlands is an important aspect that determines the degree of influence between ecosystems and the possible impacts to the mangrove derived from the effects on other wetlands with which it interacts. In this study, the composition and structure of the vegetation were monitored in the medium term (2015-2016 and 2018-2019) and the hydrological connectivity between the riparian mangrove and adjacent freshwater wetlands was characterized in 27 monitoring units (22 in mangroves, five in wetlands). The water level increased gradually as the distance to the river increased, while the opposite happened with salinity. In the period 2018-2019, the salinity of the interstitial water increased by an average of 10 PSU, causing changes in the presence and cover of some species such as Laguncularia racemosa in the cattail zone, high mortality of herbaceous species (Acrostichum danaeifolium, Typha domingensis, Phragmites australis) and tree species such as Annona glabra and Acoelorraphe wrightii, among the most evident.

"Hurricanes, Floods, Levees, and Nutria: Vegetation Responses to Interacting Disturbance and Fertility Regimes with Implications for Coastal Wetland Restoration","McFalls, TB; Keddy, PA; Campbell, D; Shaffer, G","A primary cause of wetland loss in the Louisiana coastal zone has been the construction of flood control levees along the Mississippi River. These levees restrict the inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment that historically replenished these wetlands. Wetland loss is compounded by other factors such as storms, introduced herbivores, and saltwater intrusion. How do such simultaneous changes in fertility and disturbance regimes affect the vegetation of coastal wetlands? Will proposed restoration strategies, such as freshwater diversions and protection from herbivores, increase the productivity and accretion rates of coastal wetlands without sacrificing plant species diversity? During this 2-year study, we applied five disturbance treatments (control, fire, herbivory, single vegetation removal, and double vegetation removal) and four fertility treatments (control, sediment addition, fertilizer addition, and sediment + fertilizer addition), using a split-plot factorial design with herbivory exclosures as main plots and species richness and total aboveground biomass as dependent variables. We found that nutria, the principal vertebrate herbivore of the marsh, limited biomass production. Other disturbances decreased biomass, but only to a limited extent in the absence of herbivores. The sediment + fertilizer treatment, which simulated the additional nutrients and substrate material that a freshwater diversion might deliver, significantly increased biomass production. Fertilizer significantly increased the biomass only in the absence of herbivores. We had limited success in predicting species richness after 2 years. Only the most severe disturbance decreased species richness, whereas fertilizer addition seemed to have a minor effect (p = 0.08). Sediment and nutrient-rich waters from freshwater diversions will likely mitigate negative impacts of nutria grazing on biomass and have no effect on species richness. However, it should be noted that freshwater diversions will have the most impact if nutria populations are reduced.",2010,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,26,5,901-911,WOS:000282358200012,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00037.1,,#20345,McFalls 2010,,,https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00037.1,Louisiana,,,,
ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ESTUARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES,"KENNEDY, VS","Although the timing and magnitude of global climate change is in dispute, the possible effects of such change merit consideration to allow for discussion of policy ramifications and mitigative actions. Climate change may result in sea level rise; water temperature increase; and deviations from present patterns of precipitation, wind, and water circulation.  Estuaries may experience loss of marsh habitat, intrusion of marine waters and associated organisms, changes in circulation patterns that affect retention of some indigenous species, and increased hypoxia and storm surges.  Estuarine and coastal systems could experience poleward retreat of cold-tolerant species and range expansion of warm-tolerant species.  Some fisheries and aquacultural enterprises and communities would benefit from the results of climate change and other would suffer losses, with economic and population dislocations probably inevitable in many parts of the world.

Past and Future Ecosystem Change in the Coastal Zone,"Gell, P","The coastal zone is in a constant state of flux. Long term records of change attest to high amplitude sea level changes. Relative stability though the Late Holocene has allowed for the evolution of barrier dune systems, estuaries and coastal lakes with associated plant and faunal associations. This evolution has been interspersed with changes in the balance between climate driven changes in outflow from catchments. These interactions have been considerably disturbed through the impacts of industrialised people who have diverted and consumed water and invested in infrastructure that has impacted on river flows and the tidal prism in estuaries. This has impacted their provisioning services to humans. It has also impacted their regulating services in that development along the coastline has impacted on the resilience of the littoral zone to absorb natural climate extremes. Looking from the past we can see the pathway to the future and more easily recognise the steps needed to avoid further coastal degradation. This will increasingly need to accommodate the impacts of future climate trends, increased climate extremes and rising seas. Coastal societies would do well to identify their long term pathway to adaptation to the challenges that lie ahead and plan to invest accordingly.",2017,,2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TROPICAL AND COASTAL REGION ECO DEVELOPMENT 2016,55,,,WOS:000400161100001,10.1088/1755-1315/55/1/012001,,#20479,Gell 2017,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/55/1/012001,,,,,
Nuclear cogeneration for cleaner desalination and power generation - A feasibility study,"Schmidt, JM; Gude, VG","Population growth, economic development, groundwater impairment due to salt water intrusion and local vulnerabilities caused by rising sea levels prompt immediate necessity for customized adaptation strategies for the cities of Homestead and Miami in Florida. This paper presents a feasibility study of nuclear energy driven cogeneration plant for water and power production in Homestead, FL. Miami-Dade and Homestead, Florida is home to the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Facility. The focus of this study is to investigate the economic feasibility of a seawater desalination facility on the site of an existing nuclear generating plant. While the cost of seawater desalination is often too great to overcome, it is hypothesized that sharing the infrastructure and processes with a power generating facility will lower the cost of producing freshwater. The analysis was completed with the aid of the desalination modeling software, DEEP. First, we estimate the population growth and water demands for Homestead, FL and then identify a suitable water desalination plant configuration based on freshwater and power production costs. We then compare cogeneration (water and power) schemes based on different energy sources and desalination technologies. The energy sources considered are nuclear energy, oil and natural gas for steam turbine and combined cycle power plants. In addition, we evaluate the water and power production costs for hybrid desalination configurations. Finally, the freshwater costs through nuclear desalination were assessed with other options and conventional ground water system costs. Environmental emissions saved through nuclear desalination and the need for considering this option despite the high costs are discussed in detail. The study concluded that reverse osmosis desalination plant powered by nuclear energy produced water at the lowest cost which is still three times the cost of current water rates in Homestead, Florida.",2021,,CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,2,,,WOS:000980915800010,10.1016/j.clet.2021.100044,,#20511,Schmidt 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2021.100044,Homestead,Florida,Miami,Miami-Dade,
ALOPEX stochastic optimization for pumping management in fresh water coastal aquifers,"Stratis, PN; Saridakis, YG; Zakynthinaki, MS; Papadopoulou, EP","Saltwater intrusion in freshwater aquifers is a problem of increasing significance in areas nearby the coastline. Apart from natural disastrous phenomena, such as earthquakes or floods, intense pumping human activities over the aquifer areas may change the chemical composition of the freshwater aquifer. Working towards the direction of real time management of freshwater pumping from coastal aquifers, we have considered the deployment of the stochastic optimization Algorithm of Pattern Extraction (ALOPEX), coupled with several penalty strategies that produce convenient management policies. The present study, which further extents recently derived results, considers the analytical solution of a classical model for underground flow and the ALOPEX stochastic optimization technique to produce an efficient approach for pumping management over coastal aquifers.

Tidal reversal and flow velocities using temperature and specific conductance in a small wetland creek,"Eaton, TT","Characterizing flow dynamics in very small tidal creeks is complicated and not well suited to methods developed for upland streams or coastal estuaries, due to low flows, bidirectionality and shallow waters. Simple instrumentation enables thermal and salinity signals to be used to observe flow directions and estimate velocities in these settings. Using multiple inexpensive sensors over 500 m along a tidally influenced wetland creek, I demonstrate how advection of temperature and specific conductance pulses reveal flood and ebb tides and the temporary reversal of flow by warmer, estuarine water from the receiving embayment. The sequential rise of temperature upstream was most evident under hot and dry conditions, after daily peak air temperatures of 25 degrees C or above, and was subdued or disrupted under cooler or rainy conditions in summertime. Changes in specific conductance at successive sites upstream were less susceptible to environmental influences and confirm tidal flood velocity of between 0.07 and 0.37 m/s. The tidally-induced flow reversal suggests that periodic high tide conditions can interfere with rapid dispersal of pollution discharges, such as from the combined sewer overflow (CSO) located upstream of the studied creek reach. This low-cost approach of temperature and specific conductance sensing in vegetated coastal wetlands where access, precise elevation control and creek discharge measurements are difficult, provides a simple way of tracking water masses when sufficient contrast exists between water sources.

Soil quality changes due to flood irrigation in agricultural fields along the Rio Grande in western Texas,"Cox, C; Jin, LX; Ganjegunte, G; Borrok, D; Lougheed, V; Ma, L","Growing populations demand more food, putting more pressure on soil productivity and sustainability around the world. In western Texas along the Rio Grande Valley, the low natural rainfall requires frequent irrigations for sustaining agriculture. To investigate the impacts of irrigation on soil quality, we collected and modelled geochemical data (major elements and nutrients) on irrigation water, soil pore water, drainage water, and soil samples, and monitored soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity with sensors from two pecan, one cotton, and one alfalfa fields in western Texas.This study showed that flood irrigation with both surface (Rio Grande river) and ground waters significantly increased the root-zone salinity, soil sodicity, and nutrient leaching from soils to the underlying aquifers and Rio Grande river from agricultural fields of the arid southwest. The water used for irrigation was high in total dissolved solids (> 500 ppm generally), dominated by Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ and SO42-. After flood irrigation, infiltrating water dissolved salts such as gypsum that have accumulated in the soils due to previous irrigations, or/and mixed existing concentrated soil waters, and approached saturation with respect to these evaporite minerals. Soil water was supersaturated with respect to carbonates as pedogenic calcite precipitated out and reached concentrations of similar to 10 wt% of total soil mass. This suggested that pedogenic carbonate is an important carbon reservoir and precipitation kinetics and controls of such secondary calcite need further investigation for the irrigated agricultural fields in arid regions of the world.Chemistry of agricultural return flow samples collected from drainage ditches was similar to that of irrigation water, suggesting that most of the irrigation water had taken a shallow and short flowpath through the fields to drains. Between irrigation events, soil water became more concentrated as water was lost through evapo-transpiration that led to precipitation of evaporite salts. As a result, sodicity and salinity of soils, especially clayey soils, frequently exceeded the tolerance levels of major crops grown in the region. Here in these fine-textured soils, combination of high evapotranspiration rates, intensive irrigation with water of elevated salinity, and limited infiltration stunted crop growth, decreased soil porosity and permeability, led to poor aeration, and accelerated salt buildup via a positive feedback mechanism.During initial irrigation where soils were saturated, soil water also percolated and recharged to underlying aquifers, and thus salts, nutrients, and trace metals from agricultural practices (i.e., application of fertilizers, irrigation, soil amendments, and pesticide) could be mobilized to shallow groundwaters. This implied that chemistry of Rio Grande river, groundwater, and soil was closely linked. Thus the sustainability of agriculture depended on appropriate water, soil and crop management practices.",2018,,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,90,,87-100,WOS:000424849000008,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.12.019,,#20542,Cox 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.12.019,Texas,,,,
Some observations regarding the potential effects of doming of tropical peat deposits on the composition of coal beds,"Cohen, AD; Stack, EM","Several important concepts relative to the origin of coal beds can be gleaned from studies of modern domed and planar peat deposits in tropical-subtropical settings. These are: (1) laterally, some portions of a single continuous peat deposit may be domed and some portions may be planar; (2) domed deposits are most often found to have begun as planar deposits; (3) domed-formed peat facies may be overridden by planar-formed peat facies, due to such factors as sea level rise and/or increased rate of local and basinal subsidence; (4) domed peat facies tend to have less mineral matter and contain fewer inorganic splits than planar facies; (5) sulfur intrusion from marine waters can be retarded by doming, allowing low-sulfur peats to form relatively near to the coastline; (6) marine transgression can cause high-sulfur, marine-influenced, planar, peat facies to override freshwater domed or planar facies, resulting in enrichment of the upper parts of these underlying facies in sulfur and ash; (7) dome-formed peat facies tend to be thicker and more uniform in composition than planar-formed facies, with dome-formed peat facies having the potential to produce the more uniform bright coal types (clarains and vitrains) and planar-formed pear facies often producing duller coal types and/or alternating, durainic (inertinite-rich) and vitrainic (wood-derived) bands; (8) actively developing peat domes in wet settings often exhibit no appreciable increase in inertinitic material toward their tops; although the tops of either domed or planar peat deposits can be enriched in inertinitic material if the water table is lowered by either local or regional changes in hydrology or climate.",1996,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY,29,1-3,39-65,WOS:A1996TP90800003,10.1016/0166-5162(95)00011-9,,#20549,Cohen 1996,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-5162(95)00011-9,,,,,
Chemical and hydrological controls on salt accumulation in irrigated soils of southwestern U.S,"Ortiz, AC; Jin, LX","Soil salinization is a global problem affecting approximately 10% of agricultural soils, particularly in irrigated aridlands. This study quantified salt-loading by flood irrigation and soil fertilizers/amendments versus atmospheric deposition, studied controls of solute transport and salt buildup, and evaluated the effectiveness of gypsum application in improving soil sodicity in the arid southwestern United States. Study sites include one natural site and two agricultural sites in fields of dominant crops of the region, a pecan orchard and an alfalfa field near El Paso, Texas. The salt-loading rate in agricultural soils was dominated by the quantity and quality of irrigation waters rather than by dust. Salt loadings by irrigation waters were estimated similar to 306 g Na+ m(-2) yr(-1), 129 g Ca2+ m(-2) yr(-1), 361 g Cl- m(-2) yr(-1), 419 g SO42- m(-2) yr(-1), and 284 g HCO3- m(-2) yr(-1), followed by soil amendments. Whereas dust and fertilizer loadings were negligible in agricultural soils. Soil texture variability physically governs water movement and solute transport; coarser soils retained significantly less water than finer soils upon irrigation (p < 0.005) facilitating salt leaching. More salts accumulated around low-permeability layers. Some soils have approached salinity thresholds after only 90 years of cultivation. The Rio Grande river flow is projected to decrease due to reduced snowfall in Colorado, leading to more groundwater of higher salinity, to be used. If ground water were to be the sole water source, the salt loading rate would almost double. Soil amendments temporarily reduce soil sodicity induced by high Na+ concentrations in irrigation water. Their application is needed annually to prevent soil dispersion, to improve infiltration, and to stop even faster salt accumulation. This study highlighted the challenges that the Rio Grande valley in southwestern United States and other irrigated drylands are facing.",2021,,GEODERMA,391,,,WOS:000625877700009,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.114976,,#20627,Ortiz 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.114976,United States,El Paso,Texas,Colorado,
NUTRIENT PROCESSING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIDAL CREEK ECOSYSTEMS,"DAME, RF; GARDNER, LR","The North Inlet marsh-estuarine system encompasses the spectrum of interaction between the ocean and the uplands typical of the southeastern United States. The system is an ebb-dominated, bar-built estuary with good flow connection to the sea and some freshwater input.The North Inlet basin has evolved from a forested, relic, beach-ridge terrain under a regime of slowly rising sea level (2 mm year-1). This mode of development is supported by historic tide gage data Pb-210 dating of sediment cores, the presence of spodic soil horizons and tree roots at shallow depths beneath the marsh surface, and the presence of relic 'cat eye' ponds at the edge of the salt marsh. As sea level rises, the boundary between forest and salt marsh recedes upslope and forest spodosols are gradually transformed into marsh soils by salinization, the deposition and mixing of marine mud into the upper horizons of the forest soil and the accumulation of reduced sulfur via sulfate reduction. As a forest watershed is transformed into a salt-marsh basin, the hydraulic geometry of the original, black-water (fresh) stream increases to accommodate the increasing volumes of tidal discharge. Forest sands move seaward while marine muds are transported into the basin.As water moves between the forest and the sea, it passes through creeks in different developmental stages. Large mature creeks interact with the ocean while young, ephemeral creeks drain the uplands and intertidal marsh zones. Intermediate stage creeks connect these two and are characterized by the presence of oyster reefs. Net nutrient fluxes appear to be different in each developmental stage.The 'Bly Creek' study of Dame and coworkers addressed the flux of materials between a creek at the intermediate stage of development and the adjacent mature system. Material fluxes from a freshwater stream draining into Bly Creek from the adjacent uplands were also observed. The role of the salt marsh and the oyster reefs in determining material fluxes was examined. The Bly Creek basin imports particulate nutrients and exports dissolved forms,The 'Outwelling' study of Dame and coworkers at North Inlet focused on the flux of materials between the mature creeks and the Atlantic Ocean. Ail constituents were exported seasonally and annually from the estuary, except total sediments (imported during fall and winter) and chlorophyll a (imported in the summer and fall). The export of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was high compared with other estuarine systems.On a unit area basis, primary productivity is higher and nutrient fluxes are lower in Bly Creek (intermediate stage of development) as compared with the mature North Inlet system. These observations support the general ecosystem development hypothesis that nutrient storage and retention are higher in younger systems than more mature systems where growth is lower and fewer nutrients are needed.",1993,,MARINE CHEMISTRY,43,1-4,175-183,WOS:A1993LX15300013,10.1016/0304-4203(93)90223-B,,#20658,DAME 1993,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-4203(93)90223-B,Bly Creek,United States,,,
Estimation of seawater retreat timescales in homogeneous and confined coastal aquifers based on dimensional analysis,"Mamalakis, A; Kaleris, V","Reliable estimation of the timescales of seawater retreat (SWR) in coastal aquifers has significant implications for sustainable groundwater management in coastal areas. Due to the complexity of coastal dynamics, analytical estimates of SWR timescales are limited in number, and numerical models are mainly utilized. Although numerical models allow for accurate analysis of the coastal systems, they concern particular aquifer cases, thus their results are not generally applicable. Here, we perform a dimensional analysis for the depth-integrated freshwater/seawater continuity equations and identify the dimensionless parameters that affect SWR in confined, homogeneous and flux-controlled aquifers. Based on numerical simulations, we gain insight into how these parameters affect SWR, and produce type curves which can be used as a simple tool for estimating SWR timescales in idealized coastal systems, independent of the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer. The reliability of our estimates in real-world applications is also discussed.",2019,,HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,64,2,190-209,WOS:000461573900005,10.1080/02626667.2018.1552787,,#20663,Mamalakis 2019,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2018.1552787,,,,,
Biogeochemical effects of seawater restoration to diked salt marshes,"Portnoy, JW; Giblin, AE","We conducted greenhouse microcosm experiments to examine the biogeochemical effects of restoring seawater to historically diked Cape Cod salt marshes. Feat cores from both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes were waterlogged with seawater, and porewater chemistry was subsequently monitored for 21 mo. The addition of seawater to highly organic, seasonally flooded peat caused the death of freshwater wetland plants, 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence, and increased N and P mineralization. Also, sulfides and alkalinity increased 10-fold, suggesting accelerated decomposition by sulfate reduction. Addition of seawater to the low-organic-content acidic peat from the drained marsh increased porewater pH, alkalinity, PO4-P, and Fe(II), which we attribute to the reestablishment of SO4 and Fe(III) mineral reduction. Increased cation exchange contributed to 6-fold increases in dissolved Fe(II) and Al and 60-fold increases in NH4-N within 6 mo of salination.Seawater reintroductions to seasonally flooded diked marshes will cause porewater sulfides to increase, likely reducing the success of revegetation efforts. Sulfide toxicity is of less concern in resalinated drained peats because of the abundance of Fe(II) to precipitate sulfides, and of NH4-N to offset sulfide inhibition of N uptake. Restoration of either seasonally flooded or drained diked marshes could stimulate potentially large nutrient and Fe(II) releases, which could in turn increase primary production and lower oxygen in receiving waters. These findings suggest that tidal restoration be gradual and carefully monitored.",1997,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,7,3,1054-1063,WOS:A1997XQ08100027,,,#20669,Portnoy 1997,,,https://doi.org/nan,,,,,
"Developing New Coastal Forest Restoration Products Based on Landsat, ASTER, and MODIS Data","IEEE; Spruce, JP; Smoot, J; Graham, W","This paper discusses an ongoing effort to develop new geospatial information products for aiding coastal forest restoration and conservation efforts in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi. This project employs Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data in conjunction with airborne elevation data to compute coastal forest cover type maps and change detection products. Improved forest mapping products are needed to aid coastal forest restoration and management efforts of State and Federal agencies in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) region. In particular, such products may aid coastal forest land acquisition and conservation easement procurements. This region's forests are often disturbed and subjected to multiple biotic and abiotic threats, including subsidence, salt water intrusion, hurricanes, sea-level rise, insect-induced defoliation and mortality, altered hydrology, wildfire, and conversion to non-forest land use. In some cases, such forest disturbance has led to forest loss or loss of regeneration capacity. In response, a case study was conducted to assess and demonstrate the potential of satellite remote sensing products for improving forest type maps and for assessing forest change over the last 25 years. Change detection products are needed for assessing risks for specific priority coastal forest types, such as live oak and baldcypress-dominated forest. Preliminary results indicate Landsat time series data are capable of generating the needed forest type and change detection products. Useful classifications were obtained using 2 strategies: 1) general forest classification based on use of 3 seasons of Landsat data from the same year; and 2) classification of specific forest types of concern using a single date of Landsat data in which a given targeted type is spectrally distinct compared to adjacent forested cover. When available, ASTER data was useful as a complement to Landsat data. Elevation data helped to define areas in which targeted forest types occur, such as live oak forests on natural levees. MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series data aided visual assessments of coastal forest damage and recovery from hurricanes. Landsat change detection products enabled change to be identified at the stand level and at 10-year intervals with the earliest date preceding available change detection products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and from the U.S. Geological Survey. Additional work is being done in collaboration with State and Federal agency partners in a follow-on NASA ROSES project to refine and validate these new, promising products. The products from the ROSES project will be available for aiding NGOM coastal forest restoration and conservation.",2009,,"OCEANS 2009, VOLS 1-3",,,1265-+,WOS:000280322600187,,,#20686,IEEE 2009,,,https://doi.org/nan,Louisiana,Mississippi,,,
Diverse water quality responses to extreme climate events: an introduction,"Kaushal, SS; Gold, AJ; Bernal, S; Tank, JL","We synthesize and summarize main findings from a special issue examining the origins, evolution, and resilience of diverse water quality responses to extreme climate events resulting from a Chapman Conference of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Origins refer to sequences of interactive disturbances and antecedent conditions that influence diversification of water quality responses to extreme events. Evolution refers to the amplification, intensification, and persistence of water quality signals across space and time in watersheds. Resilience refers to strategies for managing and minimizing extreme water quality impacts and ecosystem recovery. The contributions of this special issue, taken together, highlight the following: (1) there is diversification in the origins of water quality responses to extreme climate events based on the intensity, duration, and magnitude of the event mediated by previous historical conditions; (2) interactions between climate variability and watershed disturbances (e.g., channelization of river networks, land use change, and deforestation) amplify water quality pulses,' which can manifest as large changes in chemical concentrations and fluxes over relatively short time periods. In the context of the evolution of water quality responses, results highlight: (3) there are high intensity and long-term climate events, which can generate unique sequences in water quality, which have differential impacts on persistence of water quality problems and ecosystem recovery rates; and (4) chemical cocktails' or novel mixtures of elements and compounds are transported and transformed during extreme climate events. The main findings regarding resilience to extreme climate events are that: (5) river restoration strategies for reducing pollution from extreme events can be improved by preserving and restoring floodplains, wetlands, and oxbow ponds, which enhance hydrologic and biogeochemical retention, and lengthen the distribution of hydrologic residence times; and (6) the biogeochemical capacity for stream and river ecosystems to retain and transform pollution from landscapes can become saturated during floods unless watershed pollution sources are reduced. Finally, the unpredictable occurrence of extreme climate events argues for wider deployment of high-frequency, in situ sensors for monitoring, managing, and modeling diverse water quality responses. These sensors can be used to develop robust proxies for chemical cocktails, detect water quality violations following extreme climate events, and effectively trace the trajectory of water quality recovery in response to managing ecosystem resilience.",2018,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,141,3,273-279,WOS:000451259700001,10.1007/s10533-018-0527-x,,#20692,Kaushal 2018,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0527-x,,,,,
Frontal observations of the Delaware Coastal Current source region,"Sanders, TM; Garvine, RW","The Delaware Coastal Current is formed by the outflow of buoyant estuarine water from Delaware Bay. Its source region is concentrated near the Delaware coast at the estuary mouth in a narrow region typically only 4-6 km in width.We used a combination of moored current, temperature, and conductivity records together with CTD profiles, underway surface thermosalinograph records, and repeated acoustic Doppler profiling to study the source region hydrographic and current fields with emphasis on its frontal boundaries and their tidal frequency variability. Our central finding is that twin frontal boundaries exist for the source region over much of the tidal period, that is, both its offshore and onshore boundaries are fronts. Between the twin fronts lies the buoyant water of the source region, a conduit for the net seaward transport of buoyancy.These frontal boundaries are strongly modulated in horizontal density gradient at the M(2) tidal frequency. Maximum gradients occur during early flood current phase. Weaker gradients characterize the ebb current phase. The density gradient modulation is partly explained at both fronts by the occurrence of the lowest salinity and density water in the source region near the time of slack water before hood. Near the offshore front, furthermore, horizontal convergence of the flood tidal currents provides subsequent frontogenesis, so that peak frontal density gradients are reached there during the flood current phase.",1996,,CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH,16,8,1009-1021,WOS:A1996UE43200002,10.1016/0278-4343(95)00043-7,,#20695,Sanders 1996,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-4343(95)00043-7,Delaware,,,,
Integrated water management for the 21st century: Problems and solutions,"Bouwer, H","Most of the projected global population increases will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, the various water uses (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, environmental protection, and economics are key factors. More storage of water behind dams and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground as groundwater, its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and other sources and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. In irrigated areas, groundwater levels may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well systems to prevent waterlogging and salinization of soil. Salty drainage waters must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This ""virtual"" water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social, ecological, or economic returns or saved for the future. Climate changes in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emission are difficult to predict in space and time. Resulting uncertainties require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surpluses, water shortages, and weather extremes. Long-term storage behind dams and in aquifers may be required.

Projecting the effects of a warming climate on the hurricane hazard and insured losses: Methodology and case study,"Rosowsky, DV","This paper summarizes research (conducted previously by the author) to incorporate (1) sea-surface temperature projections, (2) event-based hurricane simulation models, and (3) loss models to assess the impacts of the changing climate on the hurricane hazard and estimated insured losses. The focus of the work is on the US east coast and hence the formation and movement of hurricanes over the Atlantic Basin. As an illustrative case, the area around Charleston, South Carolina is considered. Specifically, this paper presents a methodology to prob-abilistically estimate regional hurricane loss considering both hurricane intensity and size as well as projected sea surface temperature change as a function of climate change.It is most common to characterize the hurricane wind hazard using a measure of intensity only. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for storm size when characterizing the hurricane hazard in order to properly estimate/predict the spatial extent of damage. For purposes of regional loss estimation, therefore, considering maximum wind speed only may not be adequate. A storm with larger size but lower intensity might result in more damage and hence greater total loss than a smaller, more intense storm. Here, the maximum wind speed (intensity) and the radius of maximum winds (spatial extent) are selected as the two dominant indicators (parameters) characterizing the hurricane (event) hazard. The resulting bivariate hazard model is then used as input to a regional loss estimation model to illustrate its potential application. Only hurricane wind damage (and associated losses from both wind damage and water intrusion) is considered in this study. Collateral damage due to flood or storm surge is not addressed here.Simulated events impacting this region are extracted from a synthetic hurricane database (developed by the author and his colleagues) and the joint distribution of intensity and size is established to characterize the hurricane hazard. Regional loss for each simulated hurricane event is then estimated using the loss estimation module in HAZUS_MH. Finally, distributions of regional loss at different (event) hazard levels are generated.A future climate scenario (increasing sea surface temperature) is next considered and the joint distribution of hurricane intensity and size and the resulting loss distribution curve is recomputed. The results are then able to be compared to those under the current climate scenario. Such comparisons can help to inform codes and standards committees, for example, as they consider whether and how to take potential climate change impacts (in the design lifetime) into account. They also can inform ongoing public discourse around mitigation and adaptation, whether hardening of buildings and other infrastructure systems, community resilience planning, construction practices, or related policies.",2021,,STRUCTURAL SAFETY,88,,,WOS:000591646000004,10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.102036,,#20742,Rosowsky 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.102036,US,Charleston,South Carolina,,
Natural and anthropogenic effects on microplastic distribution in a hypersaline lagoon,"Quesadas-Rojas, M; Enriquez, C; Valle-Levinson, A","Information on the transport and distribution of microplastics in coastal lagoons is scarce. This study provides the first evaluation of microplastic distribution in a hypersaline coastal lagoon and explores natural and anthropogenic factors that drive their location and transport. The study combines different field strategies: spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments, for September 2017 (wet season and peak use of the lagoon) and February 2018 (winter season, characterized by intense Northerly winds and least use of the lagoon); spatial distribution of microplastics in the water column in the winter season; ocean-lagoon exchanges of water and microplastics at the lagoon entrance during tidal cycles. Also, one-year records of water level variations along the lagoon provide connections between local pressure gradients and water fluxes. Statistical analyses indicate relationships between temporal variations of microplastic concentrations and human activities. Results show marked seasonality in sources and transport agents. During the summer, microplastics concentration was related to human activities. After this season, the accumulated precipitation in the continental karst region leads to an increase in the water level at the head of the lagoon. The resulting pressure gradient promotes seaward flushing of hypersaline water and of microplastics. At tidal (diurnal) time scales, measurements at the mouth of the lagoon revealed that more particles were collected in ebb than in flood.

Mississippi River delta: an overview,"Coleman, JM; Roberts, HH; Stone, GW","Over the last century, the river-dominated Mississippi delta has received increasing attention from geoscientists, biologists, engineers, and environmental planners because of the importance of the river and its deltaic environments to the economic well-being of the state of Louisiana and the nation. Population growth, subsurface resource extraction, and increased land-water use have placed demands on the delta's natural geologic, biologic, and chemical systems, therefore modifying the time and spatial scales of natural processes within the delta and its lower alluvial valley. As a result, the combined effects of natural and human-induced processes, such as subsidence, eustatic sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and wetland loss, have produced a dynamically changing landscape and socioeconomic framework for this complex delta.Under natural conditions, the fundamental changes that result in land-building and land loss in the Holocene Mississippi River delta plain are rooted in the systematic diversion of water and sediment associated with major shifts in the river's course-the process of delta switching. Research over the last half century has shown that major relocations of the Mississippi's course have resulted in five Holocene delta complexes and a sixth one in an early stage of development as a product of the latest Atchafalaya River diversion. Collectively, these Holocene deltas have produced a delta plain that covers an area of similar to 30,000 km(2) and accounts for 41% of the coastal wetlands in the United States. After a river diversion takes place, the resulting delta evolves through a systematic and semipredictable set of stages generally characterized by: (a) rapid progradation with increasing-to-stable discharge, (b) relative stability during initial stages of waning discharge, (c) abandonment by the river in favor of a higher gradient course to the receiving basin, and (d) marine reworking of a sediment-starved delta as it undergoes progressive submergence by the combined processes of subsidence. Delta switching has taken place every 1000 to 2000 years during Holocene times, and resulting deltas have an average thickness of approximately 35 m. Within a single delta there are subdeltas, bayfills, and crevasse-splays that have higher frequency delta cycles ranging from several hundred years to a few decades. These depositional features are usually less than 10 m thick, and some have produced marshland areas of over 300 km2. The net result of these delta-building events is a low-lying landscape with components that are changing(building and deteriorating) at different rates. Geologically, these depositional cycles produce a thick accumulation of coarsening, upward deltaic deposits that have various thicknesses in response to development on a variety of temporal and spatial scales.In this river-dominated delta system, distributaries can prograde seaward at rates of over 100 m/year. The cumulative effect of the Holocene depository has been to depress the underlying Pleistocene surface. In a local setting, e.g., the modern Balize Lobe, differential loading causes the vertical displacement of underlying clay-rich facies (shale diapirs-mudlumps). The delta front of this lobe, which has prograded into deep water of the outer continental shelf, is characterized by rapid deposition of silt- and clay-rich sediments and slope instability, which results in seaward displacement of sediments by a variety of mass-movement processes.Superimposed on the natural processes and forms of the Mississippi deltaic plain and its associated estuarine environments, are human impacts, most of which have been imposed in this century. The most significant impacts have resulted from a decrease in sediment input to the river from its tributaries and the alteration of the river's natural sediment dispersal processes through the construction of levees. Measures are now being taken to reinstate some of the delta's natural processes, thereby mitigating landless so that decline in animal and plant productivity can be mitigated.",1998,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,14,3,698-716,WOS:000075421100003,,,#20782,Coleman 1998,,,https://doi.org/nan,Mississippi,Louisiana,Holocene,the United States,
Consensus based planning: Developing a conceptual plan for everglades restoration,"Appelbaum, SJ","The Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project is a multi-purpose water resources project which was built by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) to provide flood control; water supply for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses; prevention of saltwater intrusion; water supply for Everglades National Park; protection of fish and wildlife resources; and other services to the south Florida area. While the project has served its authorized purposes well, it has also had unintended adverse consequences on the unique Everglades and Florida Bay ecosystems. In 1997, Congress authorized the Corps to undertake a comprehensive review of the C&SF Project to determine the feasibility of modifying the project to restore the south Florida ecosystem while meeting other water-related needs. In June 1993, the Corps began the C&SF Project Comprehensive Review Study (Restudy). The Restudy is being accomplished by an interdisciplinary, multi-agency planning team led by the Corps and its cost-sharing partner, the South Florida Water Management District.In March 1994, Governor Lawton Chiles established the Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida to recommend strategies for ensuring the long-term compatibility of a strong south Florida economy and a healthy south Florida ecosystem. This 47 member commission consists of business, agriculture, government, public interest, and environmental organization representatives. Tn October 1995, the Commission completed its Initial Report which contained 100 recommendations for achieving sustainability in south Florida.Acting on one of its initial recommendations to provide specific recommendations describing its preferred alternatives for the Restudy, the Commission, with the assistance of the Restudy team, developed planning objectives, selected a list of 40 preferred options to be evaluated, and incorporated these options into a Conceptual Plan for the Restudywhich was completed in August 1996. The Commission's Conceptual Plan for the Restudy includes ongoing water resource projects grouped into 13 thematic concepts with additional elements, which collectively will help achieve a sustainable South Florida. The conceptual plan was developed using a facilitated process to achieve consensus of the Commission members. This process was aided by formulation workshops conducted by the Restudy team. In accordance with the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, the conceptual plan will be used as a starting point by the Restudy team for the development of a comprehensive plan that will be prepared by July 1, 1999.This paper will discuss the process used to develop the conceptual plan. The paper will focus on discussion of the role of the Restudy team in developing and presenting technical information used by the Governor's Commission in the development of the conceptual plan.",1998,,COORDINATION: WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT,,,149-150,WOS:000079047700022,,,#20809,Appelbaum 1998,,,https://doi.org/nan,Florida,C&SF,,,
"On the linkages among density, flow, and bathymetry gradients at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay","Valle-Levinson, A; Boicourt, WC; Roman, MR","Linkages among density, flow, and bathymetry gradients were explored at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay with underway measurements of density and flow profiles. Four tidal cycles were sampled along a transect that crossed the bay entrance during cruises in April-May of 1997 and in July of 1997. The April-May cruise coincided with neap tides, while the July cruise occurred during spring tides. The bathymetry of the bay entrance transect featured a broad Chesapeake Channel, 8 km wide and 17 m deep, and a narrow North Channel, 2 km wide and 14 or deep. The two channels were separated by an area with typical depths of 7 m. linkages among flows, bathymetry, and water density were best established over the North Channel during both cruises. Over this channel, greatest convergence rates alternated from the left (looking into the estuary) slope of the channel during ebb to the right slope during flood as a result of the coupling between bathymetry and tidal flow through bottom friction. These convergences were linked to the strongest transverse shears in the along-estuary tidal flow and to the appearance of salinity fronts, most markedly during ebb periods. In the wide channel, the Chesapeake Channel, frontogenesis mechanisms over the northern slope of the channel were similar to those in the North Channel only in July, when buoyancy was relatively weak and tidal forcing was relatively strong. In April-May, when buoyancy was relatively large and tidal forcing was relatively weak, the recurrence of fronts over the same northern slope of the Chesapeake Channel was independent of the tidal phase. The distinct frontogenesis in the Chesapeake Channel during the increased buoyancy period was attributed to a strong pycnocline that insulated the surface tidal flow from the effects of bottom friction, which tends to decrease the strength of the tidal flow over relatively shallow areas.",2003,,ESTUARIES,26,6,1437-1449,WOS:000188745200005,10.1007/BF02803652,,#20864,Valle-Levinson 2003,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02803652,,,,,
Hydrological processing of salinity and nitrate in the Salinas Valley agricultural watershed,"Zikalala, P; Kisekka, I; Grismer, M","Regime shifts of major salinity constituents (Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, Cl, HCO3, and NO3) in the lower Salinas River, an agricultural ecosystem, can have major impacts on ecosystem services central to continued agricultural production in the region. Regime shifts are large, persistent, and often abrupt changes in the structure and dynamics of social-ecological systems that occur when there is a reorganization of the dominant feedbacks in the system. Monitoring information on changes in the system state, controlling variables, and feedbacks is a crucial contributor to applying sustainability and ecosystem resilience at an operational level. To better understand the factors driving salinization of the lower Salinas River on the central coast of California, we examined a 27-year record of concentrations of major salinity constituents in the river. Although limited in providing an understanding of solute flux behavior during storm events, long-term ""grab sampling"" datasets with accompanying stream discharges can be used to estimate the actual history of concentrations and fluxes. We developed new concentration-discharge relationships to evaluate the dynamics of chemical weathering, hydrological processes, and agricultural practices in the watershed. Examinations of long-term records of surface water and groundwater salinity are required to provide both understanding and perspective towards managing salinity in arid and semi-arid regions while also enabling determination of the influence of external climatic variability and internal drivers in the system. We found that rock weathering is the main source of Ca, Mg, Na, HCO3, and SO4 in the river that further enables ion exchange between Ca, Mg, and Na. River concentrations of K, NO3, and Cl were associated with human activities while agricultural practices were the major source of K and NO3. A more direct anthropogenic positive trend in NO3 that has persisted since the mid-1990s is associated with the lag or memory effects of field cropping and use of flood irrigation. Event to inter-year scale patterns in the lower Salinas River salinity are further controlled by antecedent hydrologic conditions. This study underscores the importance of obtaining long-term monitoring records towards understanding watershed changes-of-state and time constants on the range of driving processes.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,193,SUPPL 1,,WOS:000650632400001,10.1007/s10661-020-08811-3,,#20882,Zikalala 2021,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08811-3,California,Ca,,,
