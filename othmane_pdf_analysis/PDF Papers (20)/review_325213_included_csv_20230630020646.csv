"Succession, regression and loss: does evidence of saltwater exposureexplain recent changes in the tree communities of North Carolina's CoastalPlain?","Ury, Emily A; Anderson, Steven M; Peet, Robert K; Bernhardt, Emily S; Wright, Justin P","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coastal plant communities globally are highlyvulnerable to future sea-level rise and storm damage, but the extent towhich these habitats are affected by the various environmentalperturbations associated with chronic salinization remains unclear. Inthis study, we examine the relationship between North Carolina wetlandtree community composition and basal area change and indicators ofsalinization such as soil salt ion content and elevation. METHODS: Wesurveyed 34 forest plots in forested, freshwater wetlands across theAlbemarle-Pamlico Peninsula. A subset of our study sites had been sampledduring the previous decade as part of the Carolina Vegetation Survey,enabling us to investigate the environmental effects on current communitystructure, and community change over time. KEY RESULTS: Multi-variate(ordination) analysis and linear regression models of tree communitycomposition revealed that elevation and soil salt content were correlatedwith changes in total site tree basal area. Shifts in tree communitycomposition were, however, only weakly correlated with indicators ofsalinization, specifically elevation, soil sulphate and sodium, but notchloride. While the majority of plots experienced gains in basal area overthe past decade, consistent with secondary succession, sites with highsoil salt content or low elevation experienced basal area (biomass) lossduring the same period. CONCLUSIONS: The key factors associated withchronic saltwater intrusion (soil ion content) likely explain recentchanges in tree biomass, and potential shifts in community composition inlow-elevation sites along the North Carolina coast. Not only is itprobable that other coastal forest ecosystems worldwide will experiencesimilar stressors and shifts in community biomass and structure as sealevels rise, but the ability of these habitats to deliver key ecosystemservices like carbon sequestration and flood defence will be compromisedas a result.",2020,,Ann.

Climate Change Driving Widespread Loss of Coastal Forested WetlandsThroughout the North American Coastal Plain,"White, Elliott E; Ury, Emily A; Bernhardt, Emily S; Yang, Xi","Coastal forested wetlands support many endemic species, sequestersubstantial carbon stocks, and have been reduced in extent due to historicdrainage and agricultural expansion. Many of these unique coastalecosystems have been drained, while those that remain are now threatenedby saltwater intrusion and sea level rise in hydrologically modifiedcoastal landscapes. Several recent studies have documented rapid andaccelerating losses of coastal forested wetlands in small areas of theAtlantic and Gulf coasts of North America, but the full extent of lossacross North America’s Coastal Plain (NACP) has not been quantified. Weused classified satellite imagery to document a net loss of ~ 13,682 km2(8%) of forested coastal wetlands across the NACP between 1996 and 2016.Most forests transitioned to scrub-shrub (53%) and marsh habitats (24%).Even within protected areas, we measured substantial rates of wetlanddeforestation and significant fragmentation of forested wetland habitats.Variation in the rate of sea level rise, the number of tropical stormlandings, and the average elevation of coastal watersheds explained about78% of the variation in coastal wetland deforestation extent along theSouth Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The rate of coastal forest loss within theNACP (684 km2/y) exceeds the recent estimate of global losses of coastalmangroves (210 km2/y). At the current rate of deforestation, in theabsence of widespread protection or restoration efforts, coastal forestedwetlands may not persist into the next century.",2022,,Ecosystems,25,4,812-827,,10.1007/s10021-021-00686-w,,#56,White 2022,,
Drought and saltwater incursion synergistically reduce dissolved organiccarbon export from coastal freshwater wetlands,"Ardón, M; Helton, A M; Bernhardt, E S","© 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. The hydrologictransport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represents both a primaryenergetic loss from and a critical energetic link between ecosystems.Coastal freshwater wetlands serve as a primary source of DOC to estuaries;historically the magnitude and timing of DOC transfers has been driven bywater movement. Extensive agricultural development throughout the coastalplain of the southeastern US has hydrologically connected much of thelandscape via canals to facilitate drainage. The resulting large-scaleloss of topographic relief and reduced mean elevation is interacting withincreasingly frequent and severe droughts to facilitate the landwardmovement of seawater through the highly connected artificial drainagenetworks. The resulting changes in hydrologic regime and salinity are eachexpected to reduce DOC export from coastal freshwater wetlands, yet theirindividual and combined impacts are not well understood. Here we show thatrepeated saltwater incursion during late summer droughts substantiallydecreased DOC concentrations in surface water (from ~40 to ~18 mg/L) froma mature and a restored forested wetland in the coastal plain of NorthCarolina, USA. These declines in DOC concentration reduced annual exportof DOC to the estuary by 70 % and dampened storm fluxes by 76 %. We used along-term experiment with intact soil columns to measure the independentand combined effects of drought, salinity, and sulfate loading aspotential drivers of the large changes in DOC concentration. We found thatsoil drying and salinization each reduced DOC similarly (20 % reduction bydrought alone, 29 % by salinization) and their combined effect wasadditive (49 % reduction in salinization + drought treatments). Ourresults demonstrate that, well in advance of significant sea-level rise,drought and relatively low levels of saltwater incursion (<6 ppt) arealready significantly altering the timing and magnitude of dissolvedorganic carbon flux between coastal forested wetlands and downstreamestuaries.",2016,,Biogeochemistry,127,3-Feb,,,10.1007/s10533-016-0189-5,,#83,Ardón 2016,,

Biogeochemical regime shifts in coastal landscapes: The contrastingeffects of saltwater incursion and agricultural pollution on greenhousegas emissions from a freshwater wetland,"Helton, Ashley M; Bernhardt, Emily S; Fedders, Anna","Many coastal plain wetlands receive nutrient pollution from agriculturalfields and are particularly vulnerable to saltwater incursion. Althoughwetlands are a major source of the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4 ) andnitrous oxide (N 2 O), the consequences of salinization for greenhouse gasemissions from wetlands with high agricultural pollution loads is rarelyconsidered. Here, we asked how saltwater exposure alters greenhouse gasemissions from a restored freshwater wetland that receives nutrientloading from upstream farms. During March to November 2012, we measuredgreenhouse gases along a \ 2 km inundated portion of the wetland. Samplinglocations spanned a wide chemical gradient from sites receiving seasonalfertilizer nitrogen and sulfate (SO 4 2- ) loads to sites receivingseasonal increases in marine salts. Concentrations and fluxes of CH 4 werelow ( \textless 100 $\mu$g L -1 and \textless 10 mg m -2 h -1 ) for allsites and sampling dates when SO 4 2- was high ( \textgreater 10 mg L -1), regardless of whether the SO 4 2- source was agriculture or saltwater.Elevated CH 4 (as high as 1,500 $\mu$g L -1 and 45 mg m -2 h -1 ) was onlyobserved on dates when air temperatures were \textgreater 27 °C and SO 42- was \textless 10 mg L -1 . Despite elevated ammonium (NH 4 + ) forsaltwater exposed sites, concentrations of N 2 O remained low ( \textless5 $\mu$g L -1 and \textless 10 $\mu$g m -2 h -1 ), except when fertilizerderived nitrate (NO 3 - ) concentrations were high and N 2 O increased ashigh as 156 $\mu$g L -1 . Our results suggest that although both saltwaterand agriculture derived SO 4 2- may suppress CH 4 , increases in N 2 Oassociated with fertilizer derived NO 3 - may offset that reduction inwetlands exposed to both agricultural runoff and saltwater incursion.\textcopyright 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",2014,,Biogeochemistry,120,3-Jan,133-147,,10.1007/s10533-014-9986-x,,#182,Helton 2014,,

Hydrologic Context Alters Greenhouse Gas Feedbacks of Coastal WetlandSalinization,"Helton, Ashley M; Ardón, Marcelo; Bernhardt, Emily S","Changes in sea-level rise and precipitation are altering patterns ofcoastal wetland hydrology and salinization. We conducted paired laboratory(20 weeks) and field (15 weeks) marine salt addition experiments todisentangle the effects of hydrology (permanent versus intermittentflooding) and elevated marine salts (sulfate versus other salt ions) ongreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freshwater forested wetland soils.Marine salt additions strongly affected GHG emissions in both experiments,but the magnitude, and even the direction, of GHG responses depended onthe hydrologic context in which marine salt exposure occurred. Underpermanent flooding, carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes were unaffected by marinesalts, whereas methane (CH 4) fluxes were significantly suppressed by theaddition of sulfate (as K 2 SO 4) both with and without marine salts. Incontrast, in intermittently flooded field and laboratory soils elevatedsalinity reduced carbon mineralization and CO 2 fluxes, but enhanced CH 4fluxes relative to both controls and treatments with elevated sulfate.Thus, elevated salinity or alkalinity (and not sulfate) controlled bothgaseous carbon fluxes under intermittent flooding. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O)fluxes had contrasting responses in the field and laboratory. In thelaboratory, N 2 O fluxes were not significantly related to chemicaltreatment but increased with porewater ammonium concentrations , whichincreased in salinity treatments via ca-tion exchange. In intermittentlyflooded field conditions, elevated salinity strongly suppressed N 2 Ofluxes because ammonium did not accumulate in porewater; it was likelylost through advection, dispersion, or plant uptake. Understanding dynamichydrologic and vegetation patterns across wetland landscapes will becritical for predicting both the magnitude and direction of wetland GHGresponses to increasing marine salt across broad spatial scales.",2019,,,,,,,10.1007/s10021-018-0325-2,,#223,Helton 2019,,
Drivers of greenhouse gas emissions from standing dead trees in ghostforests,"Martinez, Melinda; Ardón, Marcelo","Coastal freshwater forested wetlands are rapidly transitioning from forestto marsh, leaving behind many standing dead trees (snags) in areas oftencalled ‘ghost forests’. Snags can act as conduits for soil producedgreenhouse gases (GHG) and can also be sources as they decompose. Thus,snags have the potential to contribute GHGs to the atmosphere, butemissions are not well understood. We assessed GHG emissions (carbondioxide—CO2, methane—CH4, and nitrous oxide—N2O) from snags and soils infive ghost forests along a salinity gradient on the coast of NorthCarolina, USA. Mean (± SE) soil GHG fluxes (416 ± 44 mg CO2 m−2 h−1, 5.9 ±1.9 mg CH4 m−2 h−1, and 0.1 ± 0.06 mg N2O m−2 h−1) were ~ 4 times greaterthan mean snag GHGs (116 ± 15 mg CO2 m−2 h−1, 0.3 ± 0.09 mg CH4 m−2 h−1,and 0.04 ± 0.009 mg N2O m−2 h−1). Hydrological conditions and salinityinfluenced soil GHG fluxes between the two field campaigns, but snags wereless predictable and more variable. Snag and soil CO2/N2O fluxes wereinfluenced by similar environmental parameters. The drivers for soil andsnag CH4 however, were often not the same and at times oppositelycorrelated. Our results illustrate the need to further research into thedrivers and importance of GHG emissions from snags, and the need toinclude tree stems into ecosystem GHG research.",2021,,Biogeochemistry,154,3,471-488,,10.1007/s10533-021-00797-5,,#247,Martinez 2021,,
The effects of saltwater intrusion on germination success of standard andalternative crops,"de la Reguera, Elizabeth; Veatch, Jacquelyn; Gedan, Keryn; Tully, Katherine L","Saltwater intrusion (SWI) is the landward movement of seawater, which cansalinize coastal farmlands and affect crop yields. Germination is anespecially vulnerable life history stage for crops. Salt stress reduces aseed’s ability to absorb water (osmotic stress) and causes an ionimbalance within the seed (ionic stress), ultimately inhibitinggermination and preventing crop production. Therefore, growing standardcrops in the face of SWI can risk crop failure. If alternative crops aremore tolerant of osmotic and ionic stress, they may be more suited towithstand SWI. Our objectives were to (1) determine how salt stress (ionicand osmotic stress) and osmotic stress levels affect seed germination instandard and alternative crops in a controlled environment experiment and(2) compare germination rates in the controlled environment with fieldtrials. In our study region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, standardcrop species include corn, soybean, and wheat; alternative species andvarieties include sorghum, chloride-excluding soybean, barley, and quinoa.Seeds of these species were germinated under different levels of salt andosmotic stress ranging from 0 to −4 MPa (0–111.1 dS m−1, respectively) bymanipulating concentrations of NaCl to alter salt stress andconcentrations of polyethylene glycol to alter osmotic stress. Cropspecies differed greatly in germination tolerance to salt and osmoticstresses, however, there was no significant difference in percentgermination between standard and alternative crop species. Standardsoybean, chloride-excluding soybean, and quinoa were the only species togerminate in salt stress; standard soybean and chloride-excluding soybeanhad an equal tolerance during germination at -1.8 MPa (50.0 dS m−1) andquinoa successfully germinated at -0.5 MPa (13.9 dS m−1). However, wheat(standard) and barley (alternative) were the most tolerant of osmoticstress, successfully germinating at -2 MPa (55.6 dS m−1). We also examinedgermination of sorghum and chloride-excluding soybeans inpreviously-established field trials for two years on two salt-intrudedfarms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. One of the farms showed greatergermination success (measured as seedling emergence) in chloride-excludingsoybean than sorghum despite a small difference in salt stress (Δ -0.05MPa across the field). These results highlight the complexity ofunderstanding how salt stress shapes germination processes in the realworld and suggest temporal windows of low and high stress may havelong-lasting consequences for crop performance.",2020,,Environ.

Linking residential saltwater intrusion risk perceptions to physical exposure of climate change impacts in rural coastal communities of North Carolina,"Bhattachan, A.; Jurjonas, M.D.; Morris, P.R.; Taillie, P.J.; Smart, L.S.; Emanuel, R.E.; Seekamp, E.L.","The salinization of freshwater-dependent coastal ecosystems precedes inundation by sea level rise. This type of saltwater intrusion places communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure at substantial risk. Risk perceptions of local residents are an indicator to gauge public support for climate change adaptation planning. Here, we document residential perspectives on the present and future threats posed by saltwater intrusion in a rural, low-lying region in coastal North Carolina, and we compare the spatial distribution of survey responses to physical landscape variables such as distance to coastline, artificial drainage density, elevation, saltwater intrusion vulnerability, and actual salinity measured during a synoptic field survey. We evaluate and discuss the degree of alignment or misalignment between risk perceptions and metrics of exposure to saltwater intrusion. Risk perceptions align well with the physical landscape characteristics, as residents with greater exposure to saltwater intrusion, including those living on low-lying land with high concentrations of artificial drainages, perceive greater risk than people living in low-exposure areas. Uncertainty about threats of saltwater intrusion is greatest among those living at higher elevations, whose properties and communities are less likely to be exposed to high salinity. As rising sea levels, drought, and coastal storms increase the likelihood of saltwater intrusion in coastal regions, integrated assessments of risk perceptions and physical exposure are critical for developing outreach activities and planning adaptation measures. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",2019,,Nat.
