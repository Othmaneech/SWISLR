1,Saltwater intrusion in estuaries with different dynamic depths,"Guerra-Chanis, G.E.; Laurel-Castillo, J.A.; Schettini, C.A.F.; Kakoulaki, G.; Souza, A.J.; Valle-Levinson, A.","Sea-level rise threatens to increase saltwater intrusion in low-lying coastal communities worldwide. In addition, changing patterns of evaporation and precipitation are expected to modify the lengths of saltwater intrusion in estuaries. This study aims to define the length of saltwater intrusion among distinct estuaries with contrasting responses to variations in river discharge and water level. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo model was used as a supervised machine learning of the relationship among saltwater intrusion length, river discharge, water level, wind velocity and pluvial precipitation in three estuaries The supervised learning provided a relationship to project saltwater intrusion for different climatic conditions in the estuaries. The length of saltwater intrusion and river discharge were proportional for the dynamically deep Dee River estuary (UK) and Capibaribe River estuary (Brazil). Increased river discharge in those two estuaries was followed by increased limit of saltwater intrusion. For these two cases, however, it is hypothesized that beyond a threshold of river discharge, both estuaries will show a decreased saltwater intrusion with increased river discharge and transition to dynamically shallow estuaries. The dynamically shallow St. Johns River estuary (USA) had the typically expected response of decreased saltwater intrusion after increases in river discharge. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Reg. Stud.

2,Comprehensive Hydrodynamic Fitness of an Estuary Channel and the Effects of a Water Diversion Inflow,"He, W.; Jiang, A.; Zhang, J.; Xu, H.; Xiao, Y.; Chen, S.; Yu, X.","The hydrodynamic conditions of estuary channels are crucial to water exchanges, saltwater intrusions, and sediment movements. A comprehensive hydrodynamic study considering above multi-environmental impacts is imperative for the evaluation of local hydrodynamic strengths and the effects of water diversion projects. Aiming at this, this paper has proposed a comprehensive hydrodynamic fitness (CHF) framework, including the setup of numerical model, the calculation of the satisfactory percentage of a single index (SPSI), and the determination of the CHF. A hydrodynamic-dye-salinity-sediment model based on the finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) is built to elaborate the CHF using a case study of the Rongjiang River Estuary (RRE), and the effects of a freshwater inflow of 20 m3/s from a water diversion project on the CHF are revealed. The results show that the average turnover time, water salinity, and sediment deposition are 7.10 days, 9.39‰, and − 0.006 m, respectively, for the whole estuary channel in a normal year, and their SPSIs are 34.9%, 57.5%, and 69.4%, respectively. The CHFs are 55.8%, 73.9%, and 35.2% for normal, wet, and dry years, respectively, and these values can increase to 64.0%, 81.3%, and 43.5% with water diversion inflow. As sea level rises by 0.175 m, the CHF decreases from 55.8 to 52.9%, and can increase to 60.4% with water diversion inflow. The effects of the water diversion inflow on the CHF should not be linearly judged by the increase in freshwater runoff. The CHF framework can be extended to lagoons, bays, and reservoirs to support water resource management.

3,Effects of Future Increases in Tidal Flooding on Salinity and Groundwater Dynamics in Coastal Aquifers,"Heiss, J.W.; Mase, B.; Shen, C.","Future increases in the frequency of tidal flooding due to sea level rise (SLR) are likely to affect pore water salinities in coastal aquifers. In this study, we investigate the impact of increased tidal flooding frequency on salinity and flow dynamics in coastal aquifers using numerical variable-density variably-saturated groundwater flow and salt transport models. Short (sub-daily) and long (decadal) period tides are combined with SLR projections to drive continuous 80-year models of flow and salt transport. Results show that encroaching intertidal zones lead to both periodic and long-term vertical salinization of the upper aquifer. Salinization of the upper aquifer due to tidal flooding forces the lower interface seaward, even under SLR. System dynamics are controlled by the interplay between SLR and long period tidal forcing associated with perigean spring tides and the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle. Periodic tidal flooding substantially enhances intertidal saltwater-freshwater mixing, resulting in a 6- to 10-fold expansion of the intertidal saltwater-freshwater mixing area across SLR scenarios. The onset of the expansion coincides with extreme high water levels resulting from lunar nodal cycling of tidal constituent amplitudes. The findings are the first to demonstrate the combined effects of gradual SLR and short and long period tides on aquifer salinity distributions, and reveal competing influences of SLR on saltwater intrusion. The results are likely to have important implications for coastal ocean chemical fluxes and groundwater resources as tidal flooding intensifies worldwide. © 2022. The Authors.",2022,,Water Resour.

10,Saltwater Intrusion Intensifies Coastal Permafrost Thaw,"Guimond, J.A.; Mohammed, A.A.; Walvoord, M.A.; Bense, V.F.; Kurylyk, B.L.","Surface effects of sea-level rise (SLR) in permafrost regions are obvious where increasingly iceless seas erode and inundate coastlines. SLR also drives saltwater intrusion, but subsurface impacts on permafrost-bound coastlines are unseen and unclear due to limited field data and the absence of models that include salinity-dependent groundwater flow with solute exclusion and freeze-thaw dynamics. Here, we develop a numerical model with the aforementioned processes to investigate climate change impacts on coastal permafrost. We find that SLR drives lateral permafrost thaw due to depressed freezing temperatures from saltwater intrusion, whereas warming drives top-down thaw. Under high SLR and low warming scenarios, thaw driven by SLR exceeds warming-driven thaw when normalized to the influenced surface area. Results highlight an overlooked feedback mechanism between SLR and permafrost thaw with potential implications for coastal infrastructure, ocean-aquifer interactions, and carbon mobilization. © 2021.

12,Sustainable management of two-directional lateral and upconing saltwater intrusion in coastline aquifers to alleviate water scarcity,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Kuriqi, A.; Bhat, S.A.; Zelenakova, M.","Lateral saltwater intrusion (LSWI) and vertical saltwater intrusion (VSWI) are the major problems in coastal aquifers. Coastal aquifers are subjected to natural and artificial changes, including sea-level rise, decreasing inland recharge, and overexploitation of production wells' water resources. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of changing the coastal aquifers boundary conditions considering climate changes' effect. Parameters describing the upward saline well parameters based on the abstraction conditions, also, the top layer properties were studied based on the erosion and sediments, irrigation, and drainage conditions. For this purpose, the SEAWAT model was employed to simulate lateral SWI based on Henry's problem principle. The sensitivity analysis of the mentioned parameters was accomplished considering as a case study the Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA, where the LSWI and VSWI were also investigated. The results indicate that the boundary conditions, abstraction well parameters, and top layer cost significantly impact aquifer LSWI and water upconing. The simulation results of the Biscayne aquifer for a saline water head of 84.86 cm for 2060 indicate a decrease in freshwater recharge by 30% and increasing the saltwater concentration by 14.30%. At the same time, the LSWI increased by 3.30%, 22.80%, and 8.70%, while the relative upconing heights reached 0.63, 0.60, and 0.47 compared with 0.42 for the current situation. Increasing the upward saline abstraction well discharge rates by 50% increases the LSWI by 9.40%. In contrast, increasing the depth by 10%; decreases the distance by 30%, the screen length by 30%, the LSWI decreased by 1.80%, 25.10%, and 1.30%, respectively. At the same time, the relative VSWI height reached 0.60, 0.39, 0.48, and 0.40, respectively. Moreover, decreasing the top layer hydraulic conductivity by 25% and increasing the aquitards layer depths by 200% decreased the LSWI by 4.90% and 7.80%, respectively. At the same time, the relative VSWI height reached 0.34 and 0.30, respectively. In addition, the saline water heads, a freshwater recharge should be controlled to manage SWI; the upward well should be utilized at a low abstraction rate, far from the seaside, and with minimum screen length. The agriculture activity for decreasing the soil permeability for the top layer must be extended for better management of the SWI. The solution-oriented findings resulting from this study might be useful for decision-makers and engineers to develop effective management measures to tackle the SWI issue in coastal aquifers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,,Hydrol.

14,Detecting Coastal Wetland Degradation by Combining Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Modeling,"He, K.; Zhang, Y.; Li, W.; Sun, G.; McNulty, S.","Sea-level rise and climate change stresses pose increasing threats to coastal wetlands that are vital to wildlife habitats, carbon sequestration, water supply, and other ecosystem services with global significance. However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensing–hydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations. © 2022 by the authors.

15,Effects of saltwater intrusion and sea level rise on aging and corrosion rates of iron pipes in water distribution and wastewater collection systems in coastal areas,"Tansel, B.; Zhang, K.","Failure of water distribution and wastewater collection pipes can impact human health and environment due to potential contamination of water and soil in the surrounding areas, as well as service interruptions and road closures. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of projected shifts in failure rates of iron pipes due to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise in coastal areas. Probability of pipe failure depends on pipe characteristics, environmental parameters, and systems conditions. Analyses showed that saltwater intrusion and sea level rise can significantly affect the integrity of water and wastewater collection pipes due to potential changes in soil and groundwater characteristics that increase corrosion rates. Corrosion rate is intensified by increased conductivity of groundwater due to salinity. Coastal areas with subtropical climate have higher corrosion rates. The estimated lifetimes of ductile iron pipes are between 80 and 100 years. However, the actual service lifetimes can be significantly shorter. Pipes in subtropical areas corrode significantly faster than those in temperate climates. Presence of dissolved oxygen and chloride ion can significantly intensify the corrosion rates, shortening service times of iron pipes. Projections for pipe corrosion can help development of effective asset management strategies and for infrastructure maintenance planning in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,J.

17,Coastal adaptation to climate change and sea-level rise,"Griggs, G.; Reguero, B.G.","The Earth’s climate is changing; ice sheets and glaciers are melting and coastal hazards and sea level are rising in response. With a total population of over 300 million people situated on coasts, including 20 of the planet’s 33 megacities (over 10 million people), low-lying coastal areas represent one of the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change. Many of the largest cities along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. are already experiencing frequent high tide flooding, and these events will increase in frequency, depth, duration and extent as sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century and beyond. Cities in southeast Asia and islands in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean are also suffering the effects of extreme weather events combined with other factors that increase coastal risk. While short-term extreme events such as hurricanes, El Niños and severe storms come and go and will be more damaging in the short term, sea-level rise is a long-term permanent change of state. However, the effects of sea-level rise are compounded with other hazards, such as increased wave action or a loss of ecosystems. As sea-level rise could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, this may be one of the greatest challenges that human civilization has ever faced, with associated inundation of major cities, loss of coastal infrastructure, increased saltwater intrusion and damage to coastal aquifers among many other global impacts, as well as geopolitical and legal implications. While there are several short-term responses or adaptation options, we need to begin to think longer term for both public infrastructure and private development.

18,New systematically measured sand mining budget for the Mekong Delta reveals rising trends and significant volume underestimations,"Gruel, C.-R.; Park, E.; Switzer, A.D.; Kumar, S.; Loc Ho, H.; Kantoush, S.; Van Binh, D.; Feng, L.","The river beds of the Mekong Delta are some of the most intensively sand mined places in the world. However, sand mining budgets remain limited to rough and indirect estimates. Here, we provide a first systematic, field-based estimation of the Mekong Delta's sand mining budget. This budget overcomes the limitations of relying on officially declared statistics and bathymetric surveys of short channel reaches. We applied Sentinel-1 radar imagery to monitor the distribution of sand mining activities using boat metrics-driven mining intensity maps correlated with a field-based bathymetry difference map which were derived from two extensive bathymetric surveys conducted in 2014 and 2017. The two surveys cover ∼ 100 km in the Tiền River, reaching approximately 15% of the Mekong Delta. We then extrapolated the Tiền River findings to the broader Vietnamese Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020 and measured a continuous increase of the extraction budget by ∼ 25% between 2015 (38 Mm3/yr) and 2020 (47 Mm3/yr). We estimated a total sand mining budget of 254 Mm3 during the 6-year study period with an average annual rate of ∼ 42 Mm3. Our field-based annual rates are higher than both official declarations provided and estimates from previous studies which implies that a substantial portion of the sand mining budget remains unaccounted for. Riverbed sand mining remains a key threat to the Mekong Delta as it contributes to a multitude of other environmental threats including dam construction effects on sedimentation, ongoing subsidence, sea level rise and recurring saltwater intrusion. This study offers a new approach that can be implemented elsewhere to allow for systematic monitoring and quantification of sand mining activities that are vital for assessing future projections on environmental impacts. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Int.

19,Groundwater Rise and Associated Flooding in Coastal Settlements Due To Sea-Level Rise: A Review of Processes and Methods,"Bosserelle, A.L.; Morgan, L.K.; Hughes, M.W.","Coastal settlements are experiencing the effects of climate change-induced sea-level rise, including a significant but often poorly-characterized impact on groundwater. The shallow water tables present in the built coastal environment contribute to an increased risk from natural hazards such as groundwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. Historical urban development was accompanied by impacts on shallow groundwater, and in the future subsurface environments, including underground infrastructure, will face additional pressure. This article reviews processes of the coastal groundwater zone and simulation tools used to evaluate possible impacts of sea-level rise. The benefits and limitations of the two main methods to assess coastal groundwater rise and contribution to flooding are discussed using studies and investigations up to 2021. The review addresses challenges associated with the simulation tools to evaluate changes in urban hydrogeology due to sea-level rise. The models reviewed do not specifically estimate groundwater contribution to land-surface flooding. We highlight a critical need for methodology comparisons between spatial interpolation and numerical tools that will guide future work. An adequate validation of assessment methods is required and will be supported by improved coastal groundwater monitoring networks focused on water quality, saltwater intrusion, and continuous groundwater levels records. From current monitoring practices, evidence for groundwater rise with rising sea level is not widely observed at present. New monitoring sites are recommended near the coastline and tidally influenced surface water bodies, to better evaluate the rise of the water table and impacts on infrastructure. © 2022 The Authors.

22,Moderate salinity improves the availability of soil P by regulating P-cycling microbial communities in coastal wetlands,"Hu, M.; Le, Y.; Sardans, J.; Yan, R.; Zhong, Y.; Sun, D.; Tong, C.; Peñuelas, J.","Accelerated sea-level rise is expected to cause the salinization of freshwater wetlands, but the responses to salinity of the availability of soil phosphorus (P) and of microbial genes involved in the cycling of P remain unexplored. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of salinity on P cycling by soil microbial communities and their regulatory roles on P availability in coastal freshwater and brackish wetlands. Salinity was positively correlated with P availability, with higher concentrations of labile P but lower concentrations of moderately labile P in the brackish wetland. The diversity and richness of microbial communities involved in P cycling were higher in the brackish wetland than the freshwater wetland. Salinity substantially altered the composition of the P-cycling microbial community, in which those of the brackish wetland were separated from those of the freshwater wetland. Metagenomic sequence analysis indicated that functional genes involved in the solubilization of inorganic P and the subsequent transport and regulation of P were more abundant in coastal soils. The relative abundances of most of the target genes differed between the wetlands, with higher abundances of P-solubilization (gcd and ppa) and -mineralization (phoD, phy, and ugpQ) genes and lower abundances of P-transport genes (pstB, ugpA, ugpB, ugpE, and pit) in the brackish wetland. A significant positive correlation between the concentration of labile P and the abundances of the target genes suggested that salinity may, at least in part, improve P availability by regulating the P-cycling microbial community. Our results suggest that the P-cycling microbial community abundance and P availability respond positively to moderate increases in salinity by promoting the microbial solubilization and mineralization of soil P. Changes in microbial communities and microbially mediated P cycling may represent microbial strategies to adapt to moderate salinity levels, which in turn control soil function and nutrient balance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2023,,Global Change Biol.,29,1,276-288,,10.1111/gcb.16465,,#15214,Hu 2023,,
23,Microbial Composition of Freshwater Marsh Sediment Responds more Strongly to Microcosm Seawater Addition than Simulated Nitrate or Phosphate Eutrophication,"Weingarten, E.A.; Jackson, C.R.","As sea level rise impacts coastal wetlands, saltmarsh will overtake coastal freshwater marsh in many areas, but changes in the sediment microbiome in response to saltwater intrusion are difficult to predict. Coastal freshwater marsh sediment was exposed to ambient, brackish, and saline conditions as well as to elevated nitrate and phosphate to model the combined stresses of saltwater intrusion and coastal eutrophication. Initially, sediment prokaryotic composition was similar to prior studies of freshwater marsh but diverged over time, reflecting the magnitude of increase in saltwater. There was no observed effect of nutrient amendment, potentially ranking seawater intrusion as a higher-importance compositional driver. Although the previously described loss of methanogenic populations and promotion of sulfate reducers in response to saltwater exposure was observed, taxonomic distribution was not similar to typical meso-polyhaline wetlands. Without colonization by marine taxa, such a community may be short-lived naturally, ultimately equilibrating with more common saltmarsh species. However, the recapitulation of salinity concentration by freshwater sediment microbial composition demonstrates the overwhelming nature of saltwater intrusion relative to other drivers like eutrophication. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2022,,Microb.

26,Hidden costs to building foundations due to sea level rise in a changing climate,"Abdelhafez, M.A.; Ellingwood, B.; Mahmoud, H.","Coastal civil infrastructure is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Hurricane storm surge and coastal flooding can cause significant hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads on structures while saltwater intrusion (SWI) may lead to deterioration of foundations. The effects of saltwater intrusion due to Sea Level Rise (SLR) on the foundations of buildings and other civil infrastructure is poorly understood. Such damages may not be detected in a timely fashion nor be insured, leading to significant and unanticipated expenses for building owners. In this study, we evaluate the impact of SWI due to various SLR scenarios on the corrosion of reinforcement in foundations of nearly 137,000 residential buildings in low-lying areas surrounding Mobile Bay, AL. We find that the potential for costly damage is significant. Under an extreme SLR scenario, the annual expected repair costs for the foundations of the studied homes may reach as much as US$90 million by 2100. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Sci.

32,Resilience-Oriented Practices in Sea-LevelRise-Induced Human Migration in Coastal Bangladesh and Louisiana,"Ahsan, M.M.; Özbek, N.","Sea-Level Rise (SLR) combines slow- and rapid-onset climatic events and produces both environmental-induced migration and forced displacement. The coastal areas of Bangladesh and of the U.S. state of Louisiana are vulnerable to coastal or tidal flooding, saltwater intrusion, and other climatic events, which might worsen because of SLR. These coasts are facing adversity with persistent resolve due to the displacement of people from the coast due to SLR. On the basis of a systematic literature review of secondary sources, this study found that national, federal, or local governments are implementing several structural and non-structural resilience-oriented practices to keep people in their existing place. The study emphasizes that flood insurance is a resilience tool to protect residents and to help them in their existing location, but it requires adequate implementation. The study found that both structural and non-structural resilience practices with the necessary policy measures; political will; maintenance of the status quo with proper implementation of policies, plans, and programs; integration of resilience-oriented practices with relevant plans, policies, and programs; local people participation in the policymaking and implementation processes can avert people from migrating from sea-level-rise-induced impacts in both studied areas. Restoring both delta regions and giving importance to socioeconomic, ecological, and cultural aspects will be a win-win approach. © 2022.

33,Physiological and life history responses in a mayfly (Callibaetis floridanus) inhabiting ponds with saltwater intrusion,"Cochran, J.K.; Funk, D.H.; Buchwalter, D.B.","Freshwater salinity varies in natural systems and plays a role in species distribution. Anthropogenic alterations to freshwater salinity regimes include sea level rise and subsequent intrusion of saline waters to inland habitats. While mayflies are generalized to be sensitive to increasing salinity, we still know remarkably little about the physiological processes (and their plasticity) that determine the performance of species in a changing world. Here, we explored life-history outcomes and physiological plasticity in a population of Callibaetis floridanus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) from a coastal pond that routinely experiences saltwater intrusion. We reared naiads from egg hatch to adulthood across a gradient of increasing salinities (113, 5,020, 9,921 μS/cm). Radiotracer flux studies (22Na, 35SO4, and 45Ca) were conducted in naiads reared at each salinity, revealing a positive association between ionic concentration and uptake rates. However, the influence of rearing history on ionic influx rates was apparent when naiads were transferred from their respective rearing water to the other experimental conditions. For example, we observed that naiads reared in the low salinity treatment (113 μS/cm) had 10.8-fold higher Na uptake rates than naiads reared at 9,921 μS/cm and transferred to 113 μS/cm. Additionally, naiads acclimated to the higher salinity water exhibited reduced uptake in ion-rich water relative to those reared in more dilute conditions (e.g., in 9,921 μS/cm water, 113 and 5,020 μS/cm acclimated naiads had 1.5- and 1.1-fold higher Na uptake rates than 9,921 μS/cm acclimated naiads, respectively). We found no significant changes in survival (80 ± 4.4%, mean ± s.e.m.) or naiad development time (24 ± 0.3 days, mean ± s.e.m.) across these treatments but did observe a 27% decrease in subimago female body weight in the most dilute condition. This reduction in female weight was associated with higher oxygen consumption rates in naiads relative to the other rearing conditions. Collectively, these data suggests that saline adapted C. floridanus may be more energetically challenged in dilute conditions, which differs from previous observations in other mayfly species.

34,Sustainable saltwater intrusion management in coastal aquifers under climatic changes for humid and hyper-arid regions,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Straface, S.; Kuriqi, A.","Saltwater Intrusion (SWI) in many coastal areas is accelerated by freshwater boundary changes due to over-pumping and decreasing aquifer recharge and sea-level rise. This study aims to control SWI due to the rise in sea levels in three climate regions: (i) humid and wet regions using storage dams at different heads and recharge ponds, (ii) hyper-arid and arid regions using physical barriers and wastewater treatment aquifer, brackish water abstraction, and desalination (TRAD) method, and (iii) semi-arid and semi-humid regions using a combination of flooding water recharge well-field and cut-off wall. The study was developed using the world benchmark problem of Henry's problem and Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA. The finite-difference code SEAWAT was used in numerical simulations. The numerical results indicated that increasing the artificial recharge lake capacity minimizes the SWI in humid and wet regions with a high level of flooding. Moreover, the intrusion is mitigated using physical barriers and the TRAD method for hyper-arid and arid regions. Combining physical barriers during dry seasons and recharge wells for wet seasons resulted in suitable measures to managed the SWI in semi-arid and semi-humid regions. Finally, the best strategy to mitigate the SWI and minimize the desalination costs depends on the precipitation rates. Therefore, the methodology applied to this study represents a valuable tool in order to select the best method based on the climate conditions and particularly the precipitation intensity to increase the water budget in freshwater aquifers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,Ecol.

35,Resisting-accepting-directing sea level rise on the Chesapeake Bay: Agricultural producers’ motivations and actions,"Sudol, T.A.; Miller Hesed, C.D.; Clark, J.M.; Moser, F.C.","As relative rates of sea level rise accelerate in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, the frequency of flooding and saltwater intrusion on coastal lands also increases, prompting ecological transformation which can conflict with existing coastal land use such as agriculture. We performed an exploratory study of coastal farmers and woodlot managers in Maryland and Virginia to understand how these producers make land management decisions within the context of sea level rise. Specifically, we used a mixed-methods approach to identify and understand 1) the producer-observed impacts of sea level rise and flooding on coastal lands; 2) the range of actions producers may take in response to sea level rise and flooding; 3) producers' intentions for managing their land in the short- and long-term; 4) producers' motivations for selecting a particular response; and 5) the additional support coastal producers need to successfully adapt to sea level rise. We used the Resist-Accept-Direct framework as an analytical tool to understand how producers’ actions and motivations align with 1) prevention or removal of impacts from flooding and saltwater intrusion, 2) accommodation for wetter or saltier conditions as they naturally occur, or 3) facilitation of specific changes toward a new desired outcome. We found that while most producers in our study plan to resist or accept changes over the next five years, over the longer term a majority of participating producers plan to transition land to a use that is compatible with increased saltwater intrusion and flooding. Most producers in our study would prefer to continue farming yet face a lack of effective and/or affordable management options to resist ecological changes. Flexible mechanisms that support producers in resisting sea level rise impacts in the short term, while supporting them in directing the transition of their land to another productive use in the long term, are needed to support coastal farmers as they adapt to a changing climate. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,J.

40,The Estuarine Ecological Knowledge Network Makes Progress: International Project Sites and Potential Ways Forward,"McCall, G.S.; Akpan, A.; Banaduc, D.; Figueroa, D.; Fontoura, N.; Hitchcock, R.; Horn, S.; Kar, D.; Tran, T.","The Estuarine Ecological Knowledge Network (EEKN) brings together scientists and coastal fishing communities in seeking new ways forward for Earth’s major river deltas and estuaries, including the Mississippi (United States), Rio Grande (United States), Danube (Romania/ Ukraine), Ganges (India/Bangladesh), Niger (Nigeria), and Mekong (Vietnam) river deltas, and the Patos Lagoon (Brazil). Such environments are universally understood as crucial for the biological productivity of oceans and they are home to hundreds of millions of human inhabitants, many of whom directly depend on that marine richness in terms of the operation of their socioeconomic systems.

These problems are often amplified by human dynamics of environmental degradation, including overfishing, pollution, and large-scale landscape modification projects. The EEKN is designed to enhance communication and cooperation between fishing communities, scientists, and policy makers in learning about the complexity of both ecological and socioeconomic systems in estuaries and deltas, and in developing more effective policy for managing fisheries, protecting and restoring coastlines, and increasing the resilience of coastal communities. © 2022, Marine Technology Society Inc..

41,The adsorption of arsenate and p-arsanilic acid onto ferrihydrite and subsequent desorption by sulfate and artificial seawater: Future implications of sea level rise,"Barreto, M.S.C.; Elzinga, E.J.; Sparks, D.L.","Sea level rise (SLR) is estimated to impact 25% of the world's population along coastal areas leading to an increase in saltwater intrusion. Consequently, changes in the soil biogeochemistry of currently non-saline and/or well-drained soils due to saltwater intrusion are of major concern. Saltwater intrusion is expected to affect farmland across large broiler producer regions, where large amounts of manure containing organic arsenicals were applied over the past decades. To determine how SLR may impact the speciation and mobility of adsorbed inorganic and organic As, we used in situ real-time attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to determine the adsorption and desorption mechanisms of As(V) and 4-aminophenylarsonic (p-ASA, a poultry feed additive) on ferrihydrite (Fh) in the presence of sulfate at varying pH. The adsorption of As(V) and p-ASA increased at lower pH, with As(V) showing IR features consistent with the formation of inner-sphere of As-Fh surface complexes, while p-ASA also formed others structures as H-bonded As-surface complexes, likely mediated by outer-sphere complexes, based on our FTIR and batch experiments data. No observable As(V) or p-ASA desorption from the Fh surface was promoted by sulfate, however sulfate adsorption on the Fh surface was remarkably larger for p-ASA than for As(V). Complimentary, we carried out batch studies of As(V) and p-ASA desorption by Fh, using artificial seawater (ASW) at varying concentrations. The 1% ASW desorbed ∼10% of initially sorbed p-ASA, while at 100% ASW desorbed ∼40%. However, <1% of As(V) was desorbed by 1% ASW solution and only ∼7.9% were desorbed at 100% ASW. The spectroscopic data support the more extensive desorption of p-ASA compared to As(V) observed in batch experiments, suggesting that organoarsenicals may be easily desorbed and, after conversion to inorganic forms, pose a risk to water supplies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Environ.

43,Effects of Storm Surge Barrier Closures on Estuary Saltwater Intrusion and Stratification,"Chen, Z.; Orton, P.M.","Gated storm surge barriers have been constructed or proposed in many estuaries worldwide for coastal flood risk reduction. Past studies have shown that, even when open, a barrier system's fixed infrastructure can increase estuary stratification and salt intrusion, potentially affecting water quality and ecological processes. However, surge barrier closures could have a much stronger influence on estuary conditions by temporarily blocking the tidal exchange. In this project, we use an existing regional three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, with modifications to simulate surge barrier closure and reopening, to study the effects on estuarine salt intrusion and stratification of the Hudson River. Across a range of modeled scenarios of gate closure frequencies, durations and river streamflows, we evaluate the changes caused by gate closures, as well as the recovery time to normal conditions. Our results for the Hudson show long-duration gate closures (three or more days) with low streamflows temporarily lead to salt intrusion and stratification beyond recent historical extremes. Moreover, monthly frequency closures, which could occur as soon as 2070 under realistic scenarios of sea-level rise and barrier management, do not allow for recovery under low streamflow conditions and could lead to durable changes to estuary physical conditions. As a result, long duration closures and high-frequency closures both constitute a threat to municipal water supplies. This study demonstrates a framework for understanding the potential impacts of any proposed surge barrier system and can help improve our understanding of corresponding ecological impacts. © 2023.

51,Causes and consequences of changes in riparian vegetation for plant litter decomposition throughout river networks,"Kominoski, J.S.; Chapman, S.K.; Dodds, W.K.; Follstad Shah, J.J.; Richardson, J.S.","Riparian ecosystems occupy land-water interfaces along upland-to-lowland and coastal gradients of river networks. Global changes in riparian vegetation alter the types and processing of organic matter at these interfaces and throughout river networks. Dominant pathways of structural changes in riparian vegetation are associated with (i) temperature increases and changes in precipitation and hydrology, (ii) range expansion/contraction of native and non-native species, (iii) altered land-use for agriculture/forest plantations and harvesting, and urban development, (iv) shifts in disturbance regimes, such as fire, disease, pest outbreaks, and storms, and (v) saltwater intrusion. Widespread changes in riparian vegetation alter above and belowground carbon (C) stores and shift the relative proportion of algal and detrital basal resources in aquatic ecosystems. Global changes in riparian vegetation likely shift the sources and sinks of organic matter along river networks from upland headwaters to lowland rivers and coastal wetlands. Climate and global changes are expanding and contracting continental vegetation species ranges while sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion are transgressing coastal ecosystems landward. Understanding the general pathways and functional consequences of changes in riparian vegetation is vital to conserving ecosystem functions and services throughout continental river networks and coastal wetlands that are supported by organic matter processing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",2021,,The Ecol. of Plant Litter Decompos. in Stream Ecosyst.,,,273-296,,10.1007/978-3-030-72854-0_13,,#15251,Kominoski 2021,,
52,"Connecting Future Environmental Trends and Assessments of Fish and Wildlife Resources of Concern: A Case Study of Big Pine Key, Florida","Miller, L.A.; Harwell, M.C.","Changes in hydrologic and climatic trends will influence the ecology of Florida, and climate scenarios agree that many areas of Florida are susceptible to sea-level rise impacts. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Climate Change Action Program focuses on a framework to examine climate change effects on fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats of all three. To follow the program, this study examines how to incorporate current scientific knowledge about regional climate projections in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyses. It provides climate change and sea-level rise projections based on 2017 projections, information on changes in tropical cyclones, temperatures, and precipitation. This study also examines future effects of sea-level rise on existing habitat from saltwater intrusion of the freshwater lens below Big Pine Key. Projections of future sea-water elevations will periodically be reached or exceeded well before 2040 from short-term, stochastic, and extreme events (e.g., king tides and storm surge), and will increasingly inundate the root zone before complete saltwater intrusion. Future trends were connected to 2017 stakeholder-driven conversations about adaptation strategies to develop a suite of actions for creating temporary or permanent freshwater resources. However, beyond 3 ft (0.9 m) of sea-level rise, there are few adaptation options available for the Florida Key deer beyond relocations outside of the Florida Keys. Overall, the approach of connecting future environmental trends to assessments of fish and wildlife resources of concern can be transferred to other situations. Additionally, this approach can be used to update these analyses, such as with the recent 2022 sea-level rise updates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, released after this work was conducted. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Sustainability,14,21,,,10.3390/su142114553,,#15252,Miller 2022,,
53,"Future changes in habitat availability for two specialist snake species in the imperiled rocklands of South Florida, USA","Subedi, S.C.; Walls, S.C.; Barichivich, W.J.; Boyles, R.; Ross, M.S.; Hogan, J.A.; Tupy, J.A.","Rockland habitat in South Florida, USA, is a threatened ecosystem that has been lost, fragmented, or degraded because of urbanization or other anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore, low-lying islands and coastal areas are experiencing sea level rise (SLR) and an increased frequency and intensity of tidal flooding, putting rockland habitats there at increasing risk of ecological change. We evaluated changes in the extent of rockland habitat under various scenarios of future SLR, tidal flooding, and human development for two endemic state-listed threatened species of snakes, the Rim Rock Crowned Snake (Tantilla oolitica) and the Key Ring-necked Snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus). Both snakes are restricted to South Florida. We used recent and historical species' records to determine each species' habitat range. We then estimated the extent of future habitat loss due to SLR and continued human development, as well as degradation of the remaining habitat. We also asked whether the future potential drivers of habitat loss and degradation differ between the two species and across their habitat ranges. We predicted that saltwater intrusion could negatively affect rocklands by 2050, resulting in degradation of 80% of the existing habitat because of an anticipated 42 cm of SLR. Moreover, our model suggests short-term stochastic events such as storm surge and high tides may increasingly saturate the root zone of rockland vegetation before complete inundation. Under the extreme scenario, we predict most of the rockland habitat used by these two species of snakes may be inundated by 2080. Under the extreme SLR scenario, current rocklands are likely to convert to more halophytic habitat (mangrove or salt marsh wetland) within 50–60 years. Under the low scenario, 31% of rockland habitat may be lost due to human development by 2030. Therefore, mitigation actions may help to conserve specialist species within rockland habitat threatened by human activities and climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

57,Integrated modeling analysis of estuarine responses to extreme hydrological events and sea-level rise,"Wu, W.; Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Zhou, Y.; Tian, B.; Tang, Q.","Estuaries are vulnerable to climate change and are particularly sensitive to extreme river discharge (RD) and sea-level rise (SLR). To understand the effects of extreme RD and SLR on estuaries, an integrated modeling approach is adopted to simulate hydrodynamic changes in the Yangtze River Estuary. Model results showed that SLR will intensify the estuarine hydrodynamics in water level, currents, and salinity. Water level, current speed, and salinity increased linearly with the magnitude of SLR. The hydrological model suggested a lower RD in the future. This will increase the saltwater intrusion, which will be more severe during the lower RD and drought extreme hydrological event (EHE) conditions. Model results also suggested that the saltwater intrusion is more sensitive to RD than SLR. In addition, the interplay between the RD and SLR will exacerbate the impacts of coastal oceans on estuarine hydrodynamics, especially during extremely low RD conditions. Moreover, the decrease of RD and deepening of the channel due to human activities will also amplify the effects of SLR on the Estuary, increasing the risk of coastal disasters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Estuar.

59,Environmental Limits on the Spread of Invasive Phragmites australis into Upland Forests with Marine Transgression,"Shaw, P.; Jobe, J.; Gedan, K.B.","Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan grass that has transformed tidal wetlands in regions where it is invasive. The position of P. australis at the upland margin of tidal wetlands makes it likely to be among the earliest species to colonize uplands in marshes responding to sea-level rise; P. australis has been spreading in step with transgressive forest retreat. Considered a high light demanding species, the forest shade has been thought to keep this prolific species in check. In this study, we surveyed the distribution of P. australis across the marsh-forest ecotone, with particular attention to low-light areas in the forest understory, an environmental setting that has been largely overlooked in investigations of this well-studied species. We found P. australis to be present and well-established in forest canopy cover of up to 87.4%. However, canopy cover was significantly and negatively related to P. australis density in a multivariate model describing the species’ distribution in the ecotone. To test the species’ growth in shade conditions corresponding to the forest understory, we performed a greenhouse shading experiment. While photosynthetic parameters and growth rates were reduced in shade treatments, shade-grown individuals exhibited relatively high rates of photosynthesis in light-response tests, and there was no difference between the species’ performance in partial and deep shade treatments. We conclude that, while P. australis prefers high light conditions, it is able to colonize and survive low-light conditions in closed forest. By colonizing forest understory areas prior to other salt-tolerant species, P. australis is prepositioned to be the dominant species during saltwater intrusion and forest retreat. © 2021, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",2022,,Estuar.

60,Experimental and Numerical Study to Investigate the Impact of Changing the Boundary Water Levels on Saltwater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Abdel-Aal, G.M.; Fahmy, M.; Sherif, M.; Zeleňáková, M.; Abd-Elaty, I.","Experimental and numerical models can be used to investigate saltwater intrusion (SWI) in coastal aquifers. Sea level rise (SLR) and decline of freshwater heads due to climate change are the two key variables that may affect saltwater intrusion. This study aims to give a better understanding of the impact of increasing seawater levels and decreasing freshwater heads due to climate change and increasing abstraction rates due to overpopulation using experimental and numerical models on SWI. The experimental model was conducted using a flow tank and the SEAWAT code was used for the numerical simulation. Different scenarios were examined to assess the effect of seawater rise and landside groundwater level decline. The experimental and numerical studies were conducted on three scenarios: increasing seawater head by 25%, 50% and 75% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, decreasing freshwater head by 75%, 50% and 25% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, and a combination of these two scenarios. Good agreement was attained between experimental and numerical results. The results showed that increasing the seawater level and decreasing freshwater head increased saltwater intrusion, but the combination of these two scenarios had a severe effect on saltwater intrusion. The numerical model was then applied to a real case study, the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. The results indicated that the Biscayne aquifer is highly vulnerable to SWI under the possible consequences of climate change. A 25 cm seawater rise and 28% reduction in the freshwater flux would cause a loss of 0.833 million m3 of freshwater storage per each kilometer width of the Biscayne aquifer.

Therefore, these habitat-forming species and resident fauna are sensitive to modified environmental gradients. For oysters, many estuaries impacted by sea-level rise, channelization, and municipal infrastructure are experiencing saltwater intrusion and water-quality degradation that may alter reef distributions, functions, and services. To explore decadal-scale oyster–reef community patterns across a temperate estuary in response to environmental change, we resampled reefs in the Newport River Estuary (NRE) during 2013–2015 that had previously been studied during 1955–1956. We also coalesced historical NRE reef distribution (1880s–2015), salinity (1913–2015), and water-quality-driven shellfish closure boundary (1970s–2015) data to document environmental trends that could influence reef ecology and service delivery. Over the last 60–120 years, the entire NRE has shifted toward higher salinities. Consequently, oyster–reef communities have become less distinct across the estuary, manifest by 20%–27% lower species turnover and decreased faunal richness among NRE reefs in the 2010s relative to the 1950s. During the 2010s, NRE oyster–reef communities tended to cluster around a euhaline, intertidal-reef type more so than during the 1950s. This followed faunal expansions farther up estuary and biological degradation of subtidal reefs as NRE conditions became more marine and favorable for aggressive, reef-destroying taxa. In addition to these biological shifts, the area of suitable bottom on which subtidal reefs persist (contracting due to up-estuary intrusion of marine waters) and support human harvest (driven by water quality, eroding from up-estuary) has decreased by >75% since the natural history of NRE reefs was first explored. This “coastal squeeze” on harvestable subtidal oysters (reduced from a 4.5-km to a 0.75-km envelope along the NRE's main axis) will likely have consequences regarding the economic incentives for future oyster conservation, as well as the suite of services delivered by remaining shellfish reefs (e.g., biodiversity maintenance, seafood supply). More broadly, these findings exemplify how “squeeze” may be a pervasive concern for biogenic habitats along terrestrial or marine ecotones during an era of intense global change. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.",2022,,Ecol.

64,Potential management practices of saltwater intrusion impacts on soil health and water quality: A review,"Bayabil, H.K.; Li, Y.; Tong, Z.; Gao, B.","Several studies have documented the multifaceted impacts of climate change and variability on agricultural and environmental sustainability, and social and economic development. Climate change and variability contribute to increased warmer conditions, increased frequency of heavy rain that accounts for an increasing proportion of total rainfall, extreme weather characterized by spatially variable cycles of drought and wetness, increased frequency of tropical storms/hurricanes, increased frequency of storm surges, and accelerated rate of sea-level rise (SLR). As SLR continues, it is expected that salinity due to saltwater intrusion (SWI) will impact soil health and agricultural production. As such, the significant threats of salinity necessitate more work to be done to better understand its impact on soil health and associated functional ecosystem processes. This is of even greater importance in areas such as South Florida where the surface and groundwater resources are hydrologically connected due to the shallow and highly permeable limestone soils. A better understanding of the impacts of salinity due to SWI on soil health is critical to design effective mitigation strategies. Healthy soil has multifaceted benefits to enhance agricultural productivity, i.e. regulates the flow of water; serves as a source and sink of nutrients; minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and provides optimal biological and chemical conditions for the transformation of nutrients into plant-available forms. Improved understanding of the processes and impacts of SWI on soil health will assist in guiding management decisions and policies to mitigate the impacts of SWI and salinity on agricultural soils.

67,Coastal Forest Dieback in the Northeast USA: Potential Mechanisms and Management Responses,"Sacatelli, R.; Kaplan, M.; Carleton, G.; Lathrop, R.G.","A number of studies have documented coastal forest dieback as a historical and ongoing process across the Northeast US region. To further develop a current understanding of the state of knowledge, review adaptation and response measures available to land managers, and to identify research and management needs, we conducted a literature review, interviewed experts, and convened a workshop bringing together scientists and land managers. A synthesis of the above suggests that the most important proximate mechanisms driving coastal forest dieback in the Northeast US are sea level rise-induced changes in the groundwater table in concert with increased saltwater inundation related to storm surges. What sets our conceptual model apart from prior work is the greater emphasis placed on the role of rising fresh groundwater levels in increasingly stressing the forest vegetation and decreasing regeneration potential. Episodic storm surges often exceed the salinity or saturation tolerances of existing trees leading to a wave of mortality that leaves the site inhospitable to subsequent regeneration. Maintaining functioning coastal forests across the Northeast US will require that the marsh and forest ecosystems be considered as an integrated unit when determining an appropriate adaptation response. With a better understanding of each of the sea level rise-induced mechanisms at work in these ecosystems, managers may be better prepared for the changes ahead and facilitate proactive adaptation strategies. Easements or buyouts are vital to ensure that there is ample space for the marsh and upland systems to migrate landward together. Forward thinking land use planning is needed to promote the “no net loss” of both marsh and coastal forest ecosystems to ensure the continued provision of their vital services to society. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sustainability,15,8,,,10.3390/su15086346,,#15270,Sacatelli 2023,,

Impact of channel dredging and straightening in an Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides L. (B.S.P.)) freshwater tidal wetland. Journal of Coastal Research, 37(5), 973-986. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Once prominent up the eastern coast of the United States, freshwater wetlands with Atlantic white cedar (AWC; Chamaecyparis thyoides L. (B.S.P.)) are now vanishing due to saltwater intrusion and anthropogenic landscape alterations. This study utilizes a historic, anthropogenic disturbance to provide insight into the AWC response to salinization. A major straightening and dredging project in the 1920s, including 16 oxbow cuts, allowed brackish water to move upstream in the St. Jones River in Dover, Delaware, leading to the die-off of an AWC swamp. The sampled AWC experienced climate change, storms, hydrologic alterations, and sea-level rise. Annual ring width and suppression event chronologies were developed from dead AWC and were compared to groupings of climate variables in the predisturbance (1895-1920) and postdisturbance (1928-1958) periods. Results of the dendrochronological analysis indicate that the AWC in this study died at an average age of 49.3 years, earlier than typically expected for such species. After the straightening and dredging, the AWC experienced changes in growth response to temperature while suppression events became positively correlated with elevated temperature (p = 0.024) and high precipitation (p = 0.019). The system also showed signs of becoming more sensitive to storm events in the postdisturbance period. © 2021 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.",2021,,J. Coast.

69,Cooperative microbial interactions mediate community biogeochemical responses to saltwater intrusion in wetland soils,"Berrier, D.J.; Neubauer, S.C.; Franklin, R.B.","In freshwater wetlands, competitive and cooperative interactions between respiratory, fermentative and methanogenic microbes mediate the decomposition of organic matter. These interactions may be disrupted by saltwater intrusion disturbances that enhance the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), intensifying their competition with syntrophic bacteria and methanogens for electron donors. We simulated saltwater intrusion into wetland soil microcosms and examined biogeochemical and microbial responses, employing metabolic inhibitors to isolate the activity of various microbial functional groups. Sulfate additions increased total carbon dioxide production but decreased methane production. Butyrate degradation assays showed continued (but lower) levels of syntrophic metabolism despite strong demand by SRB for this key intermediate decomposition product and a shift in the methanogen community toward acetoclastic members. One month after removing SRB competition, total methane production recovered by only ∼50%. Similarly, butyrate assays showed an altered accumulation of products (including less methane), although overall rates of syntrophic butyrate breakdown largely recovered. These effects illustrate that changes in carbon mineralization following saltwater intrusion are driven by more than the oft-cited competition between SRB and methanogens for shared electron donors. Thus, the impacts of disturbances on wetland biogeochemistry are likely to persist until cooperative and competitive microbial metabolic interactions can recover fully.  © 2022 The Author(s).

70,Effects of waterlogging and salinity increase on CO2 efflux in soil from coastal marshes,"Li, Y.-L.; Ge, Z.-M.; Xie, L.-N.; Li, S.-H.; Tan, L.-S.","Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Appl.

Wetlands not only store disproportionate amounts of carbon compared to other terrestrial ecosystems, but they lie at the terrestrial-aquatic interface crucial to understanding landscape and global scale biogeochemical cycles. In this chapter, we focus on the major global change factors affecting wetlands and the responses of different wetland types to those global change factors. Special attention is given to direct responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Because of their hydrological connections and placement at the terrestrial-aquatic interface, the conservation of wetlands involves accounting for uncertainties related to interacting stressors.

Shortly afterwards, questions emerged regarding whether the structural integrity of the building was compromised by a rise in sea level caused by climate change. Historical trends in the elevation of sea-level, King Tides, and hurricane storm surge quantified between 1994 and 2020 reveal the number of times sea level rose to elevations above the building's basement floor increased from an average of 244 per year between 1994 and 2006 to 636 from 2007 to 2020.

This is an important consideration for rural coastal communities, many of which rely on on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). Subsurface inundation and flooding of OWTS leads to treatment performance issues, potentially resulting in enhanced contaminant transport to coastal groundwater resources and the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge. We use SEAWAT to develop a variable-density groundwater flow model for the groundwater system underlying a densely populated rural community on the north shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. We then impose various climate change scenarios (sea-level rise, changes in recharge) to evaluate the risk of OWTS inundation from rising groundwater. We find that under current conditions as many as 9 % of OWTS in this small but densely populated watershed are either inundated or completely flooded. This number that could grow to 27 % of OWTS for the climate change scenario with the highest recharge and sea-level rise. As a secondary objective, we track the location of the modeled saltwater-freshwater interface, and investigate the potential salinization of groundwater resources used for drinking water supply. The modeled interface moved landward by ≤ 20 m and proved to be less of a concern than OWTS inundation, except for shoreline dwellings. We also use the modelling results to develop adaptation recommendations for OWTS installation regulations. This research contributes to an increasing number of groundwater modelling studies focusing on the impacts of sea-level rise on coastal subsurface infrastructure and provides important insight for rural coastal communities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,J.

78,Assessing the social and economic impacts of sea-level rise at a global scale-State of knowledge and challenges,"Vafeidis, A.T.; Wolff, C.; Santamaria-Aguilar, S.","Sea-level rise (SLR) is one of the major consequences of climate change and is expected to continue for centuries even under stringent mitigation. SLR can have significant impacts on the world’s coastal regions that include increased flooding, erosion, loss of land and wetlands, and saltwater intrusion. These impacts can be exacerbated by the rapid socioeconomic development that is taking place in coastal areas and by the high rates of anthropogenic subsidence observed in densely populated delta regions, unless effective adaptation is in place. Assessing global exposure and impacts of SLR is necessary for guiding adaptation responses to reduce these impacts. Global assessments of exposure and impacts, however, vary in some cases considerably, thus, leading to questions regarding their accuracy. Here, we look at different global studies, discuss the underlying data and methods used, and explain the differences in the results. Despite the differences, results indicate a population of around 700 million people living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) and around 100 million people living in the 100-year floodplain. Future exposure is expected to peak around the mid-century and will be in the order of up to 1.15 billion by the end of the 21st century, depending on the socioeconomic scenario. Studies agree that proactive adaptation, in the form of hard protection can reduce damages by several orders of magnitude and is cost-effective. Although improvements in data and methods can significantly increase the accuracy of these broad-scale assessments, the current knowledge gives a clear view of the potential magnitude of impacts and provides sufficient justification for prioritizing decisions related to adaptation to SLR and for distributing adaptation funds. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,"The Impacts of Climate Change: A Comprehensive Study of Physical, Biophysical, Social, and Political Issues",,,351-363,,10.1016/B978-0-12-822373-4.00002-1,,#15286,Vafeidis 2021,,

In estuaries, the dynamics between the saltwater and the freshwater can be affected during droughts, which can impact several natural resources and economic sectors negatively. The Tagus estuary is one of the largest estuaries in Europe and supports diverse uses and activities that can be affected by the saltwater intrusion (e.g., agriculture). This study assesses the saltwater intrusion in the upper reaches of the Tagus estuary using a process-based model to explore different scenarios of freshwater discharge and sea level rise. For the river discharge and mean sea level rise scenarios analyzed, salinity can reach concentrations that are inadequate for irrigation when the mean Tagus river discharge is similar or lower than the ones observed during recent droughts (22-44 m3/s). Lower river discharges aggravate the consequences. Results also show that the salinity increases with the duration of the droughts. In contrast, the impact of a moderate sea level rise on salinity intrusion is modest when compared with the impact of low river discharges. These findings contribute to support the management of the agricultural activities in the upper Tagus estuary and the water resources in the Tagus river basin. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,,Geosciences,9,9,,,10.3390/geosciences9090400,,#15289,Rodrigues 2019,,

The results show that (1) Seasonal variations in saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River estuary are obvious. Intrusion usually begins in September-October and ends in March-April of the following year. More saltwater is present in January, February, and October, which all had more than 10 events in the last 10 years. The number of saltwater intrusions fluctuated during 2009-2018, with the highest number of 14 in 2010 and the lowest of 2 in 2015. The annual saltwater intrusion duration increased obviously during 2015-2018 and lasted 171 days in 2018. (2) The integrated influence factor of sea level and discharge is closely related to frequency and duration of saltwater occurrence, with correlation coefficients of 0.7 and 0.5, respectively (95% confidence). From January to March, the Pearl River is in the dry season, and the integrated influence factor of sea level and discharge is positive, corresponding to more saltwater intrusions. From April to August, the seasonal sea level is low and discharge is high, resulting in a negative integrated influence factor of sea level and discharge and nearly no saltwater intrusion. From September to December, the seasonal sea level is high and the discharge is low. The integrated influence factor of sea level and discharge is higher than 1, corresponding to the high occurrence of saltwater intrusions. (3) Astronomical high tides mostly occur during return tides. The combination of astronomical tides and storm surges aggravates saltwater intrusions and their influence. (4) Countermeasures, including saltwater monitoring and forecasting, river basin management, and water conservation, are suggested to effectively address saltwater intrusion. © ",2020,,J. Coast.

Rapid sea level rise and associated saltwater intrusion have negative impacts on coastal environments, including loss of habitat for species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. In Florida’s largest wetland, the Everglades, the availability of small fishes that are prey for wading birds serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. In the southwestern part of the ecosystem, sea level rise and a reduction in freshwater flow have converted formerly freshwater marsh into an estuarine mangrove-dominated landscape. In this study, we sampled fish communities in this southwest portion of the Everglades exposed to a range of saline conditions. Biomass of native fishes was highest at a salinity value of approximately 25 parts per thousand, while non-native biomass decreased with increasing salinity. Applying salinity change scenarios, we determined that a 10% reduction from the salinity levels recorded in this study would be optimal for biomass of native fishes. The baseline data we collected on non-native fishes at the site will be useful for monitoring as restoration progresses and for managers working on invasive species control. This region has been actively undergoing ecosystem restoration for the last decade, but restored freshwater flow closer to historical conditions is still years away. Without increased freshwater inflow from hydrologic restoration, rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion may provide conservation challenges for wading birds and their prey-base fishes. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.",2019,,Estuar.

Our knowledge of fungal community assembly in these compartments is limited, especially in wetlands. We tested the hypothesis that biotic factors would have direct effects on rhizosphere and endosphere assembly, while abiotic factors would have direct and indirect effects. Using a field study, we examined the influences of salinity, water level and biotic factors on baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) fungal communities. We found that endosphere fungi, unlike rhizosphere fungi, were correlated with host density and canopy cover, suggesting that hosts can impose selective filters on fungi colonizing their roots. Meanwhile, local abiotic conditions strongly influenced both rhizosphere and endosphere diversity in opposite patterns, e.g. highest endosphere diversity (hump-shaped) and lowest rhizosphere diversity (U-shaped) at intermediate salinity levels. These results indicate that the assembly and structure of the root endosphere and rhizosphere within a host can be shaped by different processes. Our results also highlight the importance of assessing how environmental changes affect plant and plant-associated fungal communities in wetland ecosystems where saltwater intrusion and sea level rise are major threats to both plant and fungal communities. © FEMS 2020.",2021,,FEMS Microbiol.

102,Effects of diversity and coalescence of species assemblages on ecosystem function at the margins of an environmental shift,"Werba, J.A.; Stucy, A.L.; Peralta, A.L.; McCoy, M.W.","Sea level rise is mixing formerly isolated freshwater communities with saltwater communities. The structure of these new aquatic communities is jointly controlled by pre- and post-colonization processes. Similarly, since salinity is a strong abiotic determinant of post-colonization survival in coastal systems, changes in salinity will likely impact community composition. In this study, we examine how a strong abiotic gradient affects the diversity and structure of bacterial and zooplankton communities and associated ecosystem functions (decomposition and carbon mineralization). We ran a six week dispersal experiment using mesocosm ponds with four distinct salinity profiles (0, 5, 9, and 13 psu). We find that salinity is the primary driver of both bacterial and zooplankton community composition. We find evidence that as bacterial richness increases so does the amount of decomposition. A phenomenological model suggests carbon mineralization may decrease at mid-salinities; this warrants future work into possible mechanisms for this apparent loss of function. Understanding how salinization changes community structure and ecosystem function may be paramount for managing and conserving coastal plain ecosystems where salinity is increasing due to sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, storm surges, and drought.

In this study, groundwater flow and salinity transport models using SEAWAT are developed for quantifying the “superposed” effects of storm surge (SS) from a Category 3 hurricane (Hurricane Jeanne which hit the Florida Atlantic coast on September 24–27, 2004) and continuous sea-level rise (SLR) on saltwater intrusion (SWI) into the surficial aquifer in coastal east-central Florida from the year of 2004 to 2024, and the simulated time-variant extent of SS- and SLR-induced landward migration of saline groundwater is compared for determination of whether the effects of SS from a Category 3 hurricane or continuous SLR on SWI are more significant. Results indicate that (1) the effects of SS are more significant than the effects of SLR within the first 12, 10, or 9 years after its occurrence date if sea level rises in low, mid, or high rate; (2) the effects of SS are more significant than the effects of SLR if SS occurs at least once within its return period (8–12 years); and (3) the maximum effects of SS are “equivalent” to the effects of the 95-year SLR, 45-year SLR, or 28-year SLR if sea level rises to 0.3 m in low, mid, or high rate.

105,"Modeling Floodplain Inundation, Circulation, and Residence Time Under Changing Tide and Sea Levels","Sullivan, J.C.; Wan, Y.; Willis, R.A.","Sea-level rise will have unknown effects on the structure and function of valuable tidal freshwater floodplains. One reason for this knowledge gap is our poor constraint on the physical controls on complex floodplain inundation and circulation processes. Here, a high-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) digital elevation model (DEM) is applied to fine-scale numerical simulations of flow and tracer exchange in a 0.43 km2 river floodplain in Southeast Florida, USA. The sequence of inundation and associated circulation patterns is assessed at 1-h intervals of the rising and falling tide in the context of floodplain geomorphic structure. The depth averaged velocity vectors show concomitant flow divergence and convergence over small spatial scales, and this complexity arises from the submergence and emergence of subtle floodplain topography over the tidal cycle. Tracer exchange and associated residence times highlight the controls of floodplain topography on water storage at the end of the ebb cycle, or during low river stages. The effects of a 0.2 m and 0.5 m increase in mean sea level on inundation extent and water retention times were also assessed. Percent change in inundated area and associated e-folding times reveal greater lateral inundation extent and a 20% increase in water retention times with up to a 0.5 m increase in mean sea level. This work reveals the topographic influence on how, when, and where sea level rise will impact the freshwater floodplain through increased hydro period and saltwater intrusion, and the importance of evaluating floodplain restoration benefits in the context of fine-scale surface flow processes and sea-level rise. © 2020, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",2020,,Estuar.

The gradual sea level rise scenario investigates the transition variation of seawater wedge toe due to linear and parabolic between the years 2015 and 2100. Moreover, the maximum value of saltwater intrusion due to variations in hydraulic conductivity and aquifer’s recharge rates is analyzed and compared with flux-controlled and head-controlled boundary condition systems. A tree model is also applied to develop a linear regression between the sea level rise and aquifer parameters derived from different real coastal aquifers in the literature. The results indicate that 1 m gradual sea level rise in the study area by the end of the year 2100 considering all 1320 pumping wells leads to a 6.5% depletion of freshwater volume. The results also show that the peak saltwater intrusion rate during nonlinear gradual sea level rise rises with increasing the aquifer depth and horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the time to reach the saltwater intrusion peak rate considering the current recharge rate of an aquifer is about 48 m. The maximum saltwater intrusion lengths estimated by the tree model are 48 m and 10.42 m for head-controlled and flux-controlled boundary conditions, respectively, indicating that the saltwater intrusion in the aquifer due to instantaneous seal level rise is closer to head-controlled boundary conditions. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).",2020,,Int.

Adequate understandings of future hydrological changes are crucial for effective water management and risk-proofing, however, this knowledge body is currently very limited. This study quantifies the responses of the VMD’s river flow regime to multiple stimuli, namely future upstream inflow variation, local climate change, and sea level rise. The one-dimensional hydrodynamic model MIKE 11 was used to simulate discharges and water levels across the delta. We developed four scenarios to represent changes in the upstream discharges, precipitation changes and sea level rise, covering the 2036–2065 period. We downscaled climate data and applied three bias-correction methods for five General Circulation Models (GCM), and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The climate change projections show similar trends of increasing wet season precipitation and decreasing dry season precipitation. However, cross-scenario variations are sometimes large, depending on the individual GCMs, the RCPs and specific locations. The hydraulic simulation results indicate that, under discharge changes between −20% and +10%, combined with in-delta precipitation variations during the dry season, river discharges at the four representative stations could reduce substantially from −2.5% to −100.2%. During the wet season, the calculated river discharges show increase between 7.3% and 46.7% under four considered scenarios.

111,Effect of saltwater intrusion on activated sludge flocculation,"Berde, M.; Jolis, D.","Saltwater addition negatively impacted the settling properties of the activated sludge in a sequencing batch reactor, which in turn caused the effluent quality and the dewatering properties to deteriorate. Experiments showed that increasing sodium ion concentrations above 1 meq/L interfered with bio-flocculation by ion exchange of calcium ions displaced by sodium in mixed liquor flocs, causing increases in the sludge volume index, total suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand concentrations of the final effluent and in the times of the time to filter test of the mixed liquor. Experiments were also conducted to reverse mixed liquor de-flocculation by adding calcium ions in wastewater with different sodium chloride concentrations and a positive relationship was found between calcium ion added and improved effluent quality. Calcium ion concentrations above 1.6 meq/L proved to be beneficial for adhesion of microbial aggregates leading to the formation of stable flocs and improved sludge dewatering by reversing the ion exchange phenomenon observed with sodium concentrations above 1 meq/L. Monovalent-to-divalent ratios did not provide predictive information on de-flocculation. Hence, individual ion concentrations in addition to monovalent-to-divalent cation ratios are important in the onset of de-flocculation effects while a system-specific concentration threshold was measured under which no adverse effects were observed.

112,Origin and Dynamics of Saltwater Intrusion in a Regional Aquifer: Combining 3-D Saltwater Modeling With Geophysical and Geochemical Data,"Meyer, R.; Engesgaard, P.; Sonnenborg, T.O.","Worldwide, aquifers in low-lying coastal areas are threatened by saltwater occurrence, as a result of small head gradients, high groundwater abstraction rates, and drain management of the landscape, which is likely to intensify with climate change. Numerical models can serve as tools to identify the sources of the salt and thus to increase understanding of the driving mechanisms and important parameters controlling the extent of saltwater intrusions. This way, areas vulnerable to sea level rise can be identified and managed. Challenges include unknown initial salt concentrations, heterogeneous geology, and anthropogenic alterations. In this study, hydrogeological, geophysical, and geochemical data are used to develop a numerical density-dependent groundwater flow and transport model with the objective to understand the history of a saltwater-affected groundwater system and its likely response to historic and future changes. The extent of the simulated saltwater intrusion compares well with Airborne Electromagnetic data that show salt water up to 20 km inland. The results reveal that the salt water originates from a combination of laterally intruding seawater and vertically infiltrating transgression water. Main features controlling the progression of the modern seawater into the coastal aquifers are high permeable, deep Miocene sand aquifers, buried valleys that provide preferential flow paths in combination with extensive Miocene clay layers that delay saltwater intrusion. Anthropogenic activity enhances the saltwater inflow from the ocean and induces transient conditions. Future scenarios show that saltwater progression due to nonstationarity leads to enhanced contamination of the deeper aquifers. Climate change affects primarily the shallow aquifer systems. ©2019.

113,Carbon mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh soils at the intersection of low-level saltwater intrusion and ferric iron loading,"Luo, M.; Zhai, Z.; Ye, R.; Xing, R.; Huang, J.; Tong, C.","Low-level saltwater intrusion and ferric iron (Fe(III)) loading are predicted for many mineral tidal freshwater ecosystems under sea-level rise. To assess their effects on the carbon mineralization processes, in-situ experiments were conducted with four treatments: Fe(III) amendment, saltwater addition, saltwater addition plus Fe(III) amendment, and a control. Soil and porewater samples (0–30 cm) were collected to assess geochemical properties and soil incubation on Days 460 and 580 after the start of the experiment. Saltwater addition increased the salinity from freshwater (0.1 mg·g−1) to oligohaline (<2 mg·g−1) and elevated the concentrations of porewater Cl−, SO4 2−, and NH4 +. Fe(III) amendment increased the concentrations of soil Fe(III), Fe(II), and total reduced sulfur (TRS). Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition enhanced the belowground biomass of marsh plants, while neither affected the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools or their ratios. Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition improved the overall mineralization rates (i.e., CO2 plus CH4 production) of the soil at 0–10 cm depths. Methanogenesis decreased under both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition. Strong negative relationships were observed between methanogenesis rates and the concentrations of porewater Cl− and SO4 2−, and soil Fe(III). Relative to the individual Fe(III) and saltwater treatments, the combined treatment did not further promote overall mineralization rates or further impede methanogenesis potential. Methanogenesis and Fe(III) reduction co-dominated the overall mineralization in the control treatment. Individual loading of Fe(III) and saltwater into the soils induced the predominance of Fe(III) and sulfate reduction, respectively. Under the combined treatment, microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction co-dominated the overall mineralization, but restrained each other. The shifts in the partitioning of mineralization pathways among treatments were primarily influenced by porewater Cl− and SO4 2−, followed by Fe(III), and then DOC. Together, the results suggest that the projected modest levels of saltwater intrusion and Fe(III) loading may simultaneously accelerate the belowground C input and mineralization rates, shifting anaerobic pathways away from CH4 production towards Fe(III) and sulfate reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Catena,193,,,,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104644,,#15337,Luo 2020,,
114,Toward a mechanistic understanding of “peat collapse” and its potential contribution to coastal wetland loss,"Chambers, L.G.; Steinmuller, H.E.; Breithaupt, J.L.","Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term “peat collapse” has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term “peat collapse” in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated. © 2019 The Authors.

The proposed control measure is numerically assessed by Henry’s problem and then applied to a real case study of Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. For each aquifer, the corresponding relation was developed between the intrusion length of saltwater wedge and the width of fill. The results showed that increasing the fill width resulted in decreasing the intrusion length. In the case of Biscayne aquifer, increasing the fill width by 10, 20, 30, and 40% of the aquifer length resulted in retarding the intrusion to 329, 192, 42, and − 48 m respectively. Using 150- and 300-m fill widths retards the intrusion length by 32.3% and 60.5%. In addition, increasing the fill width to 465 m can retard SWI by 91.3%. This approach is capable to control the future risks of SWI and sea level rise. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Environ. Sci. Pollut.

120,Chronic but not acute saltwater intrusion leads to large release of inorganic N in a tidal freshwater marsh,"Widney, S.E.; Smith, D.; Herbert, E.R.; Schubauer-Berigan, J.P.; Li, F.; Pennings, S.C.; Craft, C.B.","Sea level rise is expected to increase inundation and saltwater intrusion into many tidal freshwater marshes and forests. Saltwater intrusion may be long-term, as with rising seas, or episodic, as with low river flow or storm surge. We applied continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments of dilute seawater to replicate 2.5 × 2.5 m field plots for three years and measured soil attributes, including soil porewater, oxidation-reduction potential, soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) to investigate the effects of continuous and episodic saltwater intrusion and increased inundation on tidal freshwater marsh elemental cycling and soil processes. Continuous additions of dilute seawater resulted in increased porewater chloride, sulfate, sulfide, ammonium, and nitrate concentrations. Plots that received press additions also had lower soil oxidation-reduction potentials beginning in the second year. Episodic additions of dilute seawater during typical low flow conditions (Sept.-Oct.) resulted in transient increases in porewater chloride and sulfate that returned to baseline conditions once dosing ceased. Freshwater additions did not affect porewater inorganic N or soil C or N. Persistent saltwater intrusion in freshwater marshes alters the N cycle by releasing ammonium-N from sorption sites, increasing nitrification and severely reducing N storage in macrophyte biomass. Chronic saltwater intrusion, as is expected with rising seas, is likely to shift tidal freshwater marshes from a sink to a source of N whereas intermittent intrusion from drought may have no long term effect on N cycling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Sci.

122,"Application of numerical models to assess multi-source saltwater intrusion under natural and pumping conditions in the Great Maputo aquifer, Mozambique","Casillas-Trasvina, A.; Zhou, Y.; Stigter, T.Y.; Mussáa, F.E.F.; Juízo, D.","Regional three-dimensional groundwater-flow and saltwater transport models were built to analyse saltwater intrusion in the Great Maputo area, southern Mozambique. Increased water demand has led to many private groundwater abstractions, as the local public water supply network has already reached maximum capacity. Pushing for new strategies to tackle the water-supply shortages exposes the aquifer system to saltwater intrusion from entrapped fossil saline groundwater and seawater. Previous attempts at modelling have been frustrated by data limitations. This study compiled all the available data to build the models, which were subsequently calibrated with observed heads, discharges and salt concentrations. The transport models were used to test hypotheses of potential sources of saltwater resulting in the current salinity distribution. Furthermore, scenarios were simulated to assess the impacts of sea-level rise and projected groundwater abstractions. Results show that saline groundwater is widely distributed in the aquifer’s western sector, where it is a limiting factor for groundwater development, and seawater intrusion is a risk along the coastline. Newly constructed wells (46) along the Infulene River can be operated with some impacts of saltwater upconing and must be closely monitored. Although current groundwater abstractions (60,340 m3/day) are still small compared with groundwater recharge (980,823 m3/day), larger volumes of abstraction are feasible only when using a high number of production wells further away from the city with relatively low yields to avoid saltwater upconing. Capture of fresh groundwater upstream of discharge areas by wells for water supply is possible while maintaining groundwater discharges for groundwater dependent ecosystems. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,,Hydrogeol.

123,Addressing Sea Level Rise from the Ground Up: Understanding the Implications for Coastal Geotechnics,"Burke-Flask, A.; Stark, N.; Rodriguez-Marek, A.","One of the most critical climate change processes affecting coastal areas is sea level rise. In addition to inundating low-lying areas near the coast and increasing the frequency of flooding, sea level rise may raise the groundwater table, drive saltwater intrusion, and increase the risk for erosion and scour. These impacts represent key equilibrium shifts that will affect geotechnical site conditions and design parameters. Frequent inundation will likely increase the demand for floodable, elevated, and floating foundation systems; frequent flooding of roads may reduce the service life of pavements and erode unbound subgrade material. Groundwater rise will increase hydrostatic pressures on earth retaining structures and foundations and may complicate construction projects requiring excavation. The threat of saltwater intrusion will encourage innovative strategies for developing hydraulic barriers. Increased erosion may reduce the longevity of beach nourishment projects and increase the rate of scour around infrastructure. This paper expands on the implications of sea level rise listed above and provides an outlook on how sea level rise might impact future projects and drive trends in coastal geotechnical practice. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Increased inundation, storm surge, saltwater intrusion, and other impacts create challenges which will require considerable planning to address. Recognizing the broad and differing scope of sea level rise issues and the variability of policy options to address them, local planning frameworks are necessary in addition to tools and resources available from state and federal governments. To help assess priorities and preferences on sea level rise planning, a survey of 503 persons affiliated with coastal communities on the East Coast of the United States was conducted in December 2017. This survey studied key aspects locally-driven sea level rise plans, including planning priorities, funding options, methods to resolve conflict, and potential responses. Six key findings address these and other concerns to provide the foundation of a locally driven framework for public officials.

Evaluating the multidecadal response of historic seawater incursion events and salinity-induced meromixis at Laytons Lake, Nova Scotia, Canada. Lake Reserv Manage. 37:378–390. Long-term monitoring data from freshwater lakes can be challenging to retrieve yet are valuable for assessing lakes at risk of saltwater intrusion. We demonstrate the use of an applied paleolimnological method to identify the response of a freshwater lake to seawater incursion and salinity-induced meromixis by examining the geochemistry of lake sediments deposited over the past century. Laytons Lake is located 1.5 km from the Bay of Fundy coastline, and experienced documented seawater incursion events in 1944 and 1949 leading to a period of extended meromixis (>40 yr). Our limnological measurements indicate that meromixis no longer exists at Laytons Lake, and hypolimnetic phosphorus (P) concentrations and conductivity values have declined since 1982. Meromictic conditions, the establishment of the chemocline, and high sedimentation rates collectively preserve a geochemical record of seawater incursion, which was identified as a short-duration, positive chloride (Cl-) excursion followed by the precipitation of iron sulfide (FeS2). A decline in Cl- concentration after the incursion events in the paleorecord may represent the deterioration of the chemocline, and the reestablishment of thermal stratification and mixing. We suspect that seawater incursions can have a multidecadal impact on aquatic systems, and that bulk geochemical analysis of paleolimnological records is a useful, low-cost tool that can provide a long-term perspective on the limnological consequences of such events. These long-term data can inform the assessment of aquatic systems at risk of saltwater incursion due to sea-level rise. © 2021 North American Lake Management Society.",2021,,Lake Reserv.

129,A markov decision process model for socio-economic systems impacted by climate change,"Shuvo, S.S.; Yilmaz, Y.; Bush, A.; Hafen, M.","Coastal communities are at high risk of natural hazards due to unremitting global warming and sea level rise. Both the catastrophic impacts, e.g., tidal flooding and storm surges, and the long-term impacts, e.g., beach erosion, inundation of low lying areas, and saltwater intrusion into aquifers, cause economic, social, and ecological losses. Creating policies through appropriate modeling of the responses of stakeholders, such as government, businesses, and residents, to climate change and sea level rise scenarios can help to reduce these losses. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for an agent (government) which interacts with the environment (nature and residents) to deal with the impacts of climate change, in particular sea level rise. Through theoretical analysis we show that a reasonable government's policy on infrastructure development ought to be proactive and based on detected sea levels in order to minimize the expected total cost, as opposed to a straightforward government that reacts to observed costs from nature. We also provide a deep reinforcement learning-based scenario planning tool considering different government and resident types in terms of cooperation, and different sea level rise projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). © 2020 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2020.

Although most of the adaptation work in Virginia has focused on urban economic centers, the majority of the coastline is rural and faces different threats and opportunities to address them compared to urban areas due to their reduced economic assets and their reliance on private infrastructure. In this case study, we assess the potential for geospatially quantifying impact to septic systems and adjacent water ways due to sea level rise.

Floods, droughts, and saline intrusion become irregular and increasingly serious, greatly affecting the supply of irrigation water for agricultural production and domestic use in the basin. In this study, we used a mathematical model to simulate changing flow patterns and saline intrusion in the river system in response to different climate change scenarios. Our modelling results show that the annual flow and the dry season flow in the basin tend to decrease under the pathway RCP 8.5 in the future periods 2030-2050, and the distribution of the flow varies among simulation periods and climate change scenarios. Although future flows at the end of century tend to increase due to the impact of climate change, the simulated results show that saline intrusion also increases in all scenarios. Under the RCP 8.5 pathway, on the Vu Gia river, the salinity concentration isoline of 1 ‰ intrudes into the river from 19.7 to 20.1 km, and 4 ‰ saline isoline from 18.4 to 20.8 km. On the Thu Bon river, the salinity isoline of 1‰ enters into the river from 18.6 to 20.3 km, and from 16.7-18.5 km for the salinity isoline of 4 ‰. Our results will be a scientific basis for decision making agencies to identify appropriate development strategies to adapt and mitigate negative impacts of climate change to ensure sustainable development at the basin. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",2020,,Proc.

137,Changes in Physical Properties of Everglades Peat Soils Induced by Increased Salinity at the Laboratory Scale: Implications for Changes in Biogenic Gas Dynamics,"Sirianni, M.J.; Comas, X.","Saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise is a major concern for the Florida Everglades because it may induce shifts in ecosystem productivity and physical soil properties. However, the effects of saline water intrusion into the current carbon gas dynamics of the Everglades (particularly in terms of biogenic gas production and emissions, i.e., CH4 and CO2) are still uncertain. In this work, we present a laboratory-based study to simulate how sea level rise may alter the physical properties (i.e., hydraulic conductivity) of peat soils from the Everglades and consequently affect the accumulation and release of biogenic gases within the peat matrix. Peat monoliths collected from the Everglades were subjected to progressive increases in salinity from a NaCl solution, and changes to the biogenic gas dynamics regime were simultaneously monitored using a combination of time-lapse ground-penetrating radar measurements, manometers, time-lapse photography, and gas traps. Physical changes to the peat matrix at each salinity interval were assessed using constant head permeameter tests. Consistent with previous research, results show that a progressive increase in salinity (from fresh to saltwater) results in (1) a progressive increase in hydraulic conductivity and (2) a progressive decrease in gas content within the peat matrix (i.e., production) and gas releases. This work has implications for better understanding the potential effects of saltwater intrusion into freshwater peatland systems in the Everglades, particularly in terms of carbon gas dynamics. ©2020.

Over-abstraction of groundwater and seawater level rise due to climate change accelerate the intrusion process. This paper investigates the effects of aquifer bed slope and seaside slope on saltwater intrusion. The possible impacts of increasing seawater head due to sea level rise and decreasing groundwater level due to over-pumping and reduction in recharge are also investigated. A numerical model (SEAWAT) is applied to well-known Henry problem to assess the movement of the dispersion zone under different settings of bed and seaside slopes. The results showed that increasing seaside slope increased the intrusion of saltwater by 53.2% and 117% for slopes of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. Increasing the bed slope toward the land decreased the intrusion length by 2% and 4.8%, respectively. On the other hand, increasing the bed slope toward the seaside increased the intrusion length by 3.6% and 6.4% for bed slopes of 20:1 and 10:1, respectively. The impacts of reducing the groundwater level at the land side and increasing the seawater level at the shoreline by 5% and 10% considering different slopes are studied. The intrusion length increased under both conditions. Unlike Henry problem, the current investigation considers inclined beds and sea boundaries and, hence, provides a better representation of the field conditions. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,,Hydrology,7,1,,,10.3390/hydrology7010005,,#15377,Abd-Elhamid 2020,,
144,Moving towards sustainable coastal adaptation: Analysis of hydrological drivers of saltwater intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta,"Tran, T.A.; Dang, T.D.; Nguyen, T.H.; Pham, V.H.T.","Coastal lowlands are of particular importance in providing food, shelter, and livelihoods for large populations; yet aggravating effects caused by human activities and climate change have exposed these areas to multiple challenges. Located in the southernmost part of the Lower Mekong Basin, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is adversely affected by upstream hydropower development, localised water-engineering systems (dykes), climatic factors, and sea level rise. This paper examines how these drivers shape the adaptation strategies of rural communities in the coastal areas. Using mixed sources of historical measured data, numerical modelling and qualitative data gathered in three coastal provinces (Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, and Soc Trang), we find that hydrological alterations are manipulated by various drivers with more immediate effects of the tidal systems and sea level rise in the Vietnamese East Sea. The study results suggest that while these impacts are not adequately addressed by delta-scale measures, a mixed policy approach including control and adaptation measures has been adopted to tackle saltwater intrusion on the local scale. The paper provides a holistic insight into the complex temporal-spatial dimensions of hydrological change which have distressed coastal agroecosystems and resource-dependent communities. The paper argues that while voicing concerns over transboundary hydropower impacts is essential, in situ collaborative efforts among salinity-affected jurisdictions are equally important in addressing high uncertainty and complexity of saltwater intrusion in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,Sci.

146,Physical modelling approach for assessing the effect of climate change on groundwater at coastal area,"Raksmey, M.; Hamid, S.A.S.","Seawater intrusion has brought a great deal of attention globally with the worsening effect of rising sea level and changing of climates. Global climate change which has caused the unevenness increased in extreme events such as droughts and floods has anticipated water resources to become impaired. In this study, under the influence of climate change, a shallow unconfined groundwater was laid out orderly to investigate the saltwater intrusion phenomena in coastal aquifers. Experiments were conducted using laboratory rectangular model tank filled with fresh water, well-sorted sand and salt water into three separate chambers. In spite of the fact that numerous experimental procedures have been acquired to investigate the transient development of the saltwater interface in unconfined aquifers, none of them has tackled the possibilities of applying the climate change effect. The main focus of this particular investigation is to compare the relation of recharge and rising of sea level on the behaviour of the saltwater interface in the unconfined aquifer from laboratory experiment with the normal cases of flood and the sea level rise as well as the drought and sea level rise. Simulation on the projected rising of sea level due to the climate change leads to significant intrusion outcomes of 52.4% with a toe of the saltwater wedge (TOE) distance of 0.54 m; however, an increase in the magnitude of precipitation rates and freshwater head can ultimately recharge the groundwater. This mitigates the changes of 49% in the saltwater-freshwater interface (SFI) with a receding distance of 0.22 m. © 2021, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

Fresh groundwater reserves in coastal aquifers are particularly under threat of salinization and depletion as a result of climate change, sea-level rise, and excessive groundwater withdrawal under urbanization. To correctly assess the possible impacts of these pressures we need better information about subsurface conditions in coastal zones. Here, we propose a method that combines available global datasets to estimate, along the global coastline, the aquifer thickness in areas formed by unconsolidated sediments. To validate our final estimation results, we collected both borehole and literature data. Additionally, we performed a numerical modelling study to evaluate the effects of varying aquifer thickness and geological complexity on simulated saltwater intrusion. The results show that our aquifer thickness estimates can indeed be used for regional-scale groundwater flow modelling but that for local assessments additional geological information should be included.

149,A system-of-systems framework for exploratory analysis of climate change impacts on civil infrastructure resilience,"Mostafavi, A.","Climate change has various chronic and acute impacts on civil infrastructure systems (CIS). A long-term assessment of resilience in CIS requires understanding the transformation of CIS caused by climate change stressors and adaptation decision-making behaviors of institutional agencies. In addition, resilience assessment for CIS includes significant uncertainty regarding future climate change scenarios and subsequent impacts. Thus, resilience analysis in CIS under climate change impacts need to capture complex adaptive behaviors and uncertainty in order to enable robust planning and decision-making. This paper presents a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for abstraction and integrated modeling of climate change stressors, physical infrastructure performance, and institutional actors’ decision-making processes. The application of the proposed SoS framework is shown in an illustrative example related to the impacts of sea level rise and subsequent saltwater intrusion on a water system. Through the use of the proposed SoS framework, various attributes, processes, and interactions related to physical infrastructure and actor’s decision-making were abstracted and used in the creation of a computational simulation model. Then, the computational model was used to simulate various scenarios composed of sea level rise and adaptation approaches. Through an exploratory analysis approach, the simulated scenario landscape was used to identify robust adaptation pathways that lead to a greater system resilience under future uncertain sea level rise. The results of the illustrative example highlight the various novel capabilities of the SoS framework: (i) abstraction of various attributes and processes that affect the long-term resilience of infrastructure under climate change; (ii) integrated modeling of CIS transformation based on simulating the adaptive decision-making processes, physical infrastructure performance, and climate change impacts; and (iii) exploratory analysis and identification of robust pathways for adaptation to climate change impacts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,Sustain.

150,Impacts of increasing salinity and inundation on rates and pathways of organic carbon mineralization in tidal wetlands: a review,"Luo, M.; Huang, J.-F.; Zhu, W.-F.; Tong, C.","To improve our understanding of the carbon cycling response to imminent sea-level rise and saltwater intrusions, we review the existing literature on the likely effects of the increasing salinity and inundation on organic carbon mineralization in tidal wetlands. Enhanced salinity and inundation will reduce the pool of the organic carbon substrate, but may expand that of microbes with strong capacities for carbon metabolism. Sulfate availability increases with the increasing salinity, while availability of other electron acceptors, e.g., oxygen, nitrate, ferric oxides, and carbon dioxide, could transiently increase but would ultimately fall with the increasing salinity and inundation. The changing electron acceptor pattern may result in microbial sulfate reduction predominating over other carbon mineralization pathways. Data derived from natural salinity and inundation gradients suggest clear negative effects of salinity and inundation on production rates or emission fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane. However, results for brackish wetlands are conflicting, probably due to their unique geographic location. Salinity and inundation exert their influence on organic carbon mineralization through sulfate enrichment, elevating ionic and osmotic stress and decreasing oxygen concentrations and redox conditions, among other biogeochemical changes. Future studies should address the combined effects of salinity and inundation on carbon biogeochemistry in low-level salinity tidal wetlands. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",2019,,Hydrobiologia,827,1,31-49,,10.1007/s10750-017-3416-8,,#15387,Luo 2019,,

In some places throughout the world, this direct connection between aquifers and oceans may also allow saltwater intrusion. Saltwater intrusion was studied at a submarine spring within a fringing reef lagoon on the eastern Yucatán Peninsula by observing its intratidal and synoptic-scale variations during wet and dry periods. Saltwater intrusion was linked to wave-driven setup, no rain, high tides, and sea-level rise caused by remote forcing from Yucatán Current variability. Jet discharge velocities were inversely related to tidal oscillations, with maximum velocities at low tides. The wet period produced saltwater intrusion at high tides associated with three different conditions: syzygy tides, wave setup, and Yucatán Current weakening. During the dry period, saltwater intrusion occurred throughout most high tides and was aided by Yucatán Current weakening and wind-driven setup within the lagoon. These results suggested that seasonal precipitation was most important in modulating spring discharge, followed by syzygy tides, Yucatán Current variability, and wave events. The spring discharge was modeled with a modified Bernoulli energy equation that included a friction term. Aquifer elevation and a friction factor were used as free parameters. The dry period produced the best model results because of infrequent rainfall that yielded a relatively steady aquifer level. Precipitation during the wet period most likely led to a more variable aquifer level, reducing the variance explained by the model that assumes a constant aquifer elevation. Nevertheless, the model predicted saltwater intrusion events reasonably well using simplified physics. © 2016 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.",2016,,Limnol.

In this paper, and a companion paper by Coffey et al., we review technical literature addressing the responses of different water quality attributes to historical and potential future changes in air temperature and precipitation. The goal is to document how different attributes of water quality are sensitive to these drivers, to characterize future risk to inform management responses, and to identify research needs to fill gaps in our understanding. Here we focus on potential changes in streamflow, water temperature, and salt water intrusion (SWI). Projected changes in the volume and timing of streamflow vary regionally, with general increases in northern and eastern regions of the U.S., and decreases in the southern Plains, interior Southwest, and parts of the Southeast. Water temperatures have increased throughout the U.S. and are expected to continue to increase in the future, with the greatest changes in locations where high summer air temperatures occur together with low streamflow volumes. In coastal areas, especially the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts, SWI to rivers and aquifers could be exacerbated by sea level rise, storm surges, and altered freshwater runoff.

158,Vulnerability assessment of the South-Lebanese coast: A GIS-based approach,"Ghoussein, Y.; Mhawej, M.; Jaffal, A.; Fadel, A.; El Hourany, R.; Faour, G.","The sea-level rise phenomenon affects several socio-economic and ecological aspects worldwide, particularly in terms of coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion. While the Mediterranean region is showing an increase vulnerability to the sea-level rise, in this study, we implement the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI), between 2005 and 2013, on the Southern Lebanese coast. The selection of this study area is related to its commonly known vulnerable sandy beaches. The CVI is derived from six physical and geological variables that are estimated using Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing techniques. Results show that this eastern Mediterranean coast has a moderate (66% of its total lengths) to high coastal vulnerability (30% of its total lengths) to the sea-level rise. As predicted, sandy beaches in our study area represent the most vulnerable regions. On the other hand, an absence of a Pearson correlation between the amount of the sea level rise and the sea surface temperature, is shown. It is probably related to the direct human interference that eclipsed the climate change as the main driving force in that period (i.e. 2005–2013).

Stakeholders are encouraged to implement this approach to combat the coastal vulnerability of these areas.

159,"The role of economic, policy, and ecological factors in estimating the value of carbon stocks in Everglades mangrove forests, South Florida, USA","Jerath, M.; Bhat, M.; Rivera-Monroy, V.H.; Castañeda-Moya, E.; Simard, M.; Twilley, R.R.","Old growth mangroves in existing protected areas store more carbon than restored forests or plantations. Carbon storage in such forests has economic value independent of additionality, offering opportunities for policy makers to ensure their maintenance, and inclusion in climate change mitigation strategies. Mangrove forests of the Everglades National Park (ENP), South Florida, though protected, face external stressors such as hydrological alterations because of flooding control structures and agriculture impacts and saltwater intrusion as a result of increasing sea level rise. Moreover, decreased funding of Everglades’ restoration activities following the recent economic crisis (beginning 2008) threatens the restoration of the Greater Everglades including mangrove dominated coastal regions. We evaluate several economic and ecological challenges confronting the economic valuation of total (vegetation plus soil) organic carbon (TOC) storage in the ENP mangroves. Estimated TOC storage for this forested wetland ranges from 70 to 537 Mg C/ha and is higher than values reported for tropical, boreal, and temperate forests. We calculate the average abatement cost of C specific for ENP mangroves to value the TOC from $2–$3.4 billion; estimated unit area values are $13,859/ha–$23,728/ha. The valuation of the stored/legacy carbon is based on the: 1) ecogeomorphic attributes, 2) regional socio-economic milieu, and 3) status of the ENP mangroves as a protected area. The assessment of C storage estimates and its economic value can change public perception about how this regulating ecosystem service of ENP mangrove wetlands (144,447 ha) supports human well-being and numerous economic activities. This perception, in turn, can contribute to future policy changes such that the ENP mangroves, the largest mangrove area in the continental USA, can be included as a potential alternative in climate change mitigation strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,,Environ.

There are many other driven parameters in determining salt intrusion such as tides, river discharge, and river geometry. This paper studies the salinity distribution using the tide driven parameters during high and low waters. The objectives of this study are to obtain the salinity and pH values at different tidal impact of low and high waters in determining one of the physical indices along Kilim River, Langkawi. There were ten different stations with 500 m of interval along the study area starting from the Kilim River Jetty towards the river mouth. The salinity was obtained from six different depths with the reading of pH values and temperature as supporting details of the observation made along the Kilim River, Langkawi. The depth at each station varied from 0.5 to 3.0 m with 0.5 m of interval. Based on the results obtained from this study, the salinity during high water was highly stratified compared to those of low water. The salinity characteristic is important to further research on the impact of sea level rise at the estuaries. The salinity distribution pattern may contribute to the different species of vegetation along the Kilim River, Langkawi. Therefore, this study will help in contributing the mangrove migration for future research. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",2018,,MATEC Web Conf.,250,,,,10.1051/matecconf/201825004006,,#15400,MohdSuhaimi 2018,,
161,"Investigating effects of climate change, urbanization, and sea level changes on groundwater resources in a coastal aquifer: an integrated assessment","Akbarpour, S.; Niksokhan, M.H.","Urbanization and climate change are causing numerous side effects on groundwater resources. In this study, an integrated modeling approach by linking soil and water application tool (SWAT), modular finite difference groundwater flow (MODFLOW), and three-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow coupled with multi-species solute and heat transport (SEAWAT) models were used to exhibit responses of groundwater systems, in terms of flow and salt concentrations to current and future climatic and anthropogenic changes. Future climate scenarios for periods of 2010–2040 were generated from the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM) for scenarios A1B, B1, and A2 which was downscaled by the Long Ashton Research Station weather generator (LARS-WG) providing precipitation and temperature patterns for the period 2018–2040. The GCM’s outputs were applied to SWAT model to estimate recharge rate for the ten scenarios designed to assess the sensitivity of the aquifer to urbanization and climate change. The estimated recharge rate from SWAT was utilized as an input in numerical groundwater model to evaluate saltwater intrusion (SWI), changes in freshwater storage within the aquifer system, and changes in groundwater level. Based on the results of each scenario’s simulation, increase of pumping rate yield by future population growth will have more adverse effects on the unconfined aquifer. The derived information from this study can be used to improve future works by developing a better understanding of the managed and unmanaged response of freshwater storage and unconfined groundwater systems to climate change and anthropogenic activities. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2018,,Environ.

164,Transience of seawater intrusion and retreat in response to incremental water-level variations,"Abdoulhalik, A.; Ahmed, A.A.","This paper provides for the first time an experimental study where the impact of sea-level fluctuations and inland boundary head-level variations on freshwater–saltwater interface toe motion and transition zone dynamics was quantitatively analysed under transient conditions. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory flow tank where various (inland and coastal) head changes were imposed to the system and the response of the key seawater intrusion parameters was analysed with high spatial and temporal resolution. Two homogeneous aquifer systems of different grain size were tested. The numerical code SEAWAT was used for the validation. The results show that in cases of sea-level variations, the intruding wedge required up to twice longer time to reach a new steady-state condition than the receding wedge, which thereby extend the theory of timescale asymmetry between saltwater intrusion and retreat processes in scenarios involving sea-level fluctuations. The intruding and receding rates of the saltwater wedge were respectively similar in the scenario involving sea-level and the freshwater-level changes, despite change in transmissivity. The results show that, during the intrusion phase, the transition zone remains relatively insensitive, regardless of where the boundary head change occurs (i.e., freshwater drop or sea-level rise) or its magnitude. By contrast, a substantial widening of the transition zone was observed during the receding phase, with almost similar amplitude in the scenario involving a rise of the freshwater level compared with that caused by a drop of the saltwater level, provided that an equivalent absolute head change magnitude was used. This transition zone widening (occurring during saltwater retreat) was greater and extended over longer period in the low hydraulic conductivity aquifer, for both freshwater-level rise and sea-level drop scenarios. The concentration maps revealed that the widening mechanism was also enhanced by the presence of some freshwater sliding and into the wedge during saltwater retreat, which was thereafter sucked upward towards the interface because of density difference effects. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2018,,Hydrol.

167,Physiological and oxidative stress responses of baldcypress in response to elevated salinity: linking and identifying biomarkers of stress in a keystone species,"Lauer, N.; Ross, C.","Globally, saltwater intrusion associated with sea level rise is threatening the vitality of coastal freshwater wetland communities. In the current study, we investigated the impacts of salinity stress on Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich), a tree common to coastal freshwater wetlands within the southeastern USA. Salinity-induced responses of saplings and adult trees were assessed in a greenhouse and field-based study, respectively. In the greenhouse study, saplings maintained under mesohaline conditions (8 g L−1) for 10 weeks exhibited a predictable physiological response characterized by decreased maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and increased non-photochemical quenching. Changes in photochemistry were concomitant with increases in leaf sodium, hydrogen peroxide, and free proline content compared to saplings maintained in freshwater. A strong negative correlation existed between Fv/Fm and leaf hydrogen peroxide content. Salinity-stressed saplings also exhibited decreased activity of a low molecular weight peroxidase isozyme within leaf tissue. Taken together, the evidence suggests that H2O2 was maintained at marginally elevated levels in leaf tissue to elicit a physiological response. Adult trees sampled in situ displayed similar stress responses to elevated salinity as saplings from the greenhouse study. Specifically, trees sampled at a basin swamp exhibited decreased Fv/Fm and increased non-photochemical quenching, lipid peroxidation, and free proline content in leaf tissue compared to trees at other sites. Thus, coupling chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with stable biomarkers show promise in detecting sub-lethal salinity stress for plants in situ. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.",2016,,Acta Physiol.

168,Increasing Methane Emissions From Natural Land Ecosystems due to Sea-Level Rise,"Lu, X.; Zhou, Y.; Zhuang, Q.; Prigent, C.; Liu, Y.; Teuling, A.","Atmospheric methane (CH4) is one of the most important greenhouse gases. However, there is still a large uncertainty in simulating CH4 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. Different from modeling studies focusing on response of CH4 emissions to various environmental changes in land ecosystems, this study analyzed the response of CH4 emissions to sea-level rise (SLR). To do so, a large-scale surface water routing module was incorporated into an existing CH4 model. This allowed the model to simulate the effect of SLR on river flows and inland water levels. This study focused on these freshwater systems and did not address saltwater intrusion or coastal wetland impacts. Both the annual maximum inundation extent and CH4 emissions at the global level showed a steadily growing trend, with an increase of 1.21 × 105 km2 in extent and an increase of 3.13 Tg CH4/year in CH4 emissions, in a 22-year SLR experiment from 1993 to 2014. Most of new inundation and methane source areas were located near rivers' deltas and along downstream reaches of rivers. The increase in the inundation extent is primarily influenced by precipitation, channel geomorphic characteristics, and topography of riverside area. The increase of CH4 emissions due to the SLR is largely determined by the inundation extent, but other factors such as air temperature and carbon storage also play roles. Although the current SLR-induced increases in the inundation extent and CH4 emissions only accounted for 1.0% and 1.3% of their global totals, these increases contributed 7.0% and 17.3% of the mean annual variability in both, respectively, during the study period. Considering that SLR has a long-term increasing trend, future SLR under a changing climate could play a more important role in global CH4 emissions. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

For example, coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are major threats for the Black Sea coasts. So, determining sea level changes in the Black Sea is important in terms of coastal risk assessment and coastal planning. In this study, present-day sea level change in the Black Sea is estimated from satellite altimetry and gravity measurements. Altimetry data demonstrate that the Black Sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.5 ± 0.5 mm/year from January 1993 to May 2017. During this period, inter-annual variability of the non-seasonal sea level change is quite strong. Furthermore, mass contribution to this change for the period 2002-2017 has been detected as 2.3 ± 1.0 mm/year from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mascon solutions. © Authors 2018.

173,"Climate Change Impacts on Bromide, Trihalomethane Formation, and Health Risks at Coastal Groundwater Utilities","Kolb, C.; Pozzi, M.; Samaras, C.; VanBriesen, J.M.","In some regions, sea level rise due to climate change is expected to increase saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers, leading to increased salt levels in drinking water wells relying on these supplies. Seawater contains elevated concentrations of bromide, which has been shown to increase the formation and alter the speciation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during the treatment process. DBPs have been associated with increased risk of cancer and negative reproductive outcomes, and they are regulated under drinking water standards to protect human health. This paper incorporates statistical simulation of changes in source water bromide concentrations as a result of potential increased saltwater intrusion to assess the associated impact on trihalomethane (THM) formation and speciation. Additionally, the health risk associated with these changes is determined using cancer slope factors and odds ratios. The analysis indicates that coastal utilities treating affected groundwater sources will likely meet regulatory levels for THMs, but even small changes in saltwater intrusion can have significant effects on finished water concentrations and may exceed desired health risk threshold levels due to the extent of bromination in the THM. As a result of climate change, drinking water utilities using coastal groundwater or estuaries should consider the implications of treating high bromide source waters. Additionally, extra consideration should be taken for surface water utilities considering mixing with groundwater sources, as elevated source water bromide could pose additional challenges for health risk, despite meeting regulatory requirements for THM. © 2017 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.",2017,,ASCE-ASME J.

As the sea level rises, the associated increase in surface seawater inundation and subsurface saltwater intrusion will reduce the availability of fresh groundwater due to permanent salinization of groundwater with corresponding thinning of freshwater lens. This paper provides scientific insights on how freshwater lens in atoll islands respond to SLR. Simulations on saturated-unsaturated variable-density groundwater flow with salt transport are performed by the groundwater flow and solute transport model SUTRA (Saturated-Unsaturated Transport) developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Model simulations and statistical analyses suggest that freshwater lens thickness depends mainly on groundwater recharge rate, island size and aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The impact of various geo-hydrologic parameters on fresh groundwater sustainability is then analyzed to explore feasibility of increasing groundwater recharge through rainwater harvesting, as a mitigation measure. The implication to the achievement of sustainable clean water and sanitation for all (SDG 6) is also discussed. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.",2019,,Math.

180,Spatiotemporal distributions of sr and ba along an estuarine river with a large salinity gradient to the Gulf of Mexico,"He, S.; Xu, Y.J.","Strontium and barium to calcium ratios are often used as proxies for tracking animal movement across salinity gradients. Many estuarine rivers face saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise, potentially causing changes in mobility and distribution of these metals upstream. From May 2013 to August 2015, monthly water samples were collected and in-situ measurements were performed at six sites along an estuary strongly affected by saltwater intrusion, the Calcasieu River, with salinity ranging from 0.02 to 29.50 Parts Per Thousand (ppt). Results showed that the total Sr concentration and the Sr/Ca ratio both increased significantly with increasing salinity. The average Sr concentration at the site closest to the Gulf of Mexico (Site 6) was 46.21 μmol/L, about 130 times higher than that of the site furthest upstream (Site 1, 0.35). The average Sr/Ca ratio at Site 6 (8.41 mmol/mol) was about three times the average Sr/Ca ratio at Site 1 (2.89). However, the spatial variation in total Ba concentration was marginal, varying from 0.36 to 0.47 μmol/L. The average Ba/Ca ratio at Site 1 (4.82 mmol/mol) was about 54 times the ratio at Site 6 (0.09), showing a negative relation between the Ba/Ca ratio and salinity. All elemental concentrations and ratios had considerable seasonal variations, with significant differences among sampling months for the Sr and Ba concentrations and the Ba/Ca ratio (p < 0.01). The results suggest that for low-gradient estuarine rivers such as the Calcasieu River, water chemistry upstream would experience substantial Sr and Ca enrichment, potentially affecting aquatic environments and biological communities. © 2016 by the authors.",2016,,Water,8,8,,,10.3390/w8080323,,#15426,He 2016,,
184,Changes in abundance and community structure of nitrate-reducing bacteria along a salinity gradient in tidal wetlands,"Franklin, R.B.; Morrissey, E.M.; Morina, J.C.","Primarily because of their high levels of microbiological activity, wetland soils play a key role in ameliorating nitrogen pollution and reducing nutrient loadings to coastal zones. Saltwater intrusion associated with climate change is expected to dramatically affect the biogeochemistry of these soils and induce changes in the composition of the soil microbial community that may alter their ability to process nitrogen. In this study, the abundance and community structure of microorganisms associated with two key nitrate removal pathways – denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) – were assessed for eight tidal wetlands along a naturally-occurring salinity gradient (0–2 ppt) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (USA). Molecular analyses targeted functional genes specific for each pathway (denitrification: nirS and nosZ; DNRA: nrfA). Shifts in abundance and community structure of both groups of nitrate reducers were strongly coupled to changes in salinity, and correlation analyses suggested that the effect of salinity on these organisms may have been mediated, at least in part, by changes in soil organic matter availability. Considering the growing body of evidence that microbial community composition may help regulate ecosystem process rates, an increased understanding of how salinity affects nitrogen cycling microbial communities may help us better predict how wetland soil function will be affected by global change and issues such as sea level rise. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",2017,,Pedobiologia,60,,21-26,,10.1016/j.pedobi.2016.12.002,,#15430,Franklin 2017,,
187,"Breeding sites of a narrowly distributed amphibian, a key element in its conservation in the face of global change","Cobos, M.E.; Alonso Bosch, R.","Global change processes (including climate change, sea-level rise, and land-use change, among others) represent significant threats to biodiversity. These changes are usually studied across broad areas, and understanding their effects on narrowly distributed endangered species is challenging. Peltophryne florentinoi is a critically endangered Cuban toad, restricted to two coastal localities and potentially threatened by these phenomena. Despite its endangered status, few analyses have focused on threats to its survival in the face of global change. Current and future threats from global change to this species were evaluated using ecological niche modelling and multiscale geographic information system (GIS) approaches. Climate change effects were assessed by comparing the species niche with six future (2050) climate scenarios across its distribution area. Risks from sea-level rise were evaluated by simulating potential coastal inundation under three scenarios of sea-level rise. Recent land-use changes were quantified using information on the loss of forest cover between 2000 and 2015. Within the species distribution area, warmer and drier conditions can be expected in the future. Sea-level rise will not have direct impacts on the species range; however, occasional inundations and saltwater intrusion may present additional stressors. Although only ~2% of the forest cover has been lost in the species range and its surroundings during 2000–2015, deforestation trends were variable during this period, and future losses in forest cover can be expected. Considering these threats, and that the colonization of new areas seems unlikely, indirect and additive adverse effects on the species can be anticipated. These impacts will most probably be observed during the larval stage of this toad; hence, breeding sites constitute a key element in the conservation of this species. Long-term studies and experimental manipulations may be the next steps towards a better understanding of the responses of P. florentinoi to expected changes.

The need for accurate projections of SLR impacts has motivated several experimental mesocosm studies aimed at detailed investigations on wetland biogeochemical cycling. However, the degree with which they accurately reproduce field conditions remains unknown because they have primarily been laboratory based using relatively small sediment volumes (10–200 L) treated over short time periods. As a first step towards addressing these issues, we present a novel mesocosm device and portable methodology for long-term SLR simulation via in situ saltwater additions to relatively large sediment volumes (approximately 1,000 L). The device (chamber) consists of two interlocking polycarbonate cylinders with an internal diameter of 1.4 m. Each cylinder has holes drilled in the side to facilitate water exchange. The outer cylinder (collar) can be rotated to one of two possible positions. The first position produces alignment of the inner cylinder holes with the collar holes, whereas the second position offsets the holes to eliminate water exchange and contain salt additions (doses). Our device design and dosing scheme produced higher porewater salinities in the sediments of treatment mesocosms relative to control mesocosm sediments. In addition, we observed low incidence of elevated porewater salinity outside of the chamber walls and no measurable salt contamination of control plots. Widespread SLR simulations in a variety of geographical settings, whether with our proposed design or some other design, would likely help reduce some of the general uncertainties regarding the sensitivity of coastal wetlands to SLR and saltwater intrusion. © 2018 The Authors.

Given the projected sea level rise and saltwater intrusion, coastal wetland ecosystems are subject to higher salt stress, thus shifting in structure and function. Here, we focused on two vascular plants, a native species Scirpus mariqueter and an invasive species Spartina alterniflora in the Yangtze Estuary, aiming to explore the survival, growth, and reproduction of these two dominant species under a series of salinity stress. The responses of S. mariqueter and S. alterniflora to salinity were compared, and the salinity thresholds for survival of both species were calculated. The results showed that: (1) Survival rate of both species decreased as salinity increased, whereas the survival rate of S. alterniflora surpassed that of S. mariqueter under the same salinity (P<0.05). (2) Growth of both species was significantly curtailed by increasing salinity (P<0.05); plant height, aboveground and belowground biomass of S. mariqueter decreased as salinity increased, but those of S. alterniflora increased first then decreased when salinity reached >10‰ (3) Number of tillers and percent seed setting of both species decreased as salinity increased, suggesting an inhibited reproductive potential as affected by salinity; (4) S. mariqueter (with a salinity threshold of 21‰) was more susceptible to salinity than S. alterniflora (a salinity threshold of 43‰); (5) Being more salt-tolerant, the invasive S. alterni flora would overwhelm the native S. mariqueter under scenarios of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. © 2018, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

Forests vary widely across the region, and vulnerabilities are strongly influenced by regional differences in climate impacts and adaptive capacity. Not all forests are vulnerable; longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures will increase suitable habitat and biomass for many temperate species. Upland systems dominated by oak species generally have low vulnerability due to greater tolerance of hot and dry conditions, and some oak, hickory, and pine species are expected to become more competitive under hotter and physiologically drier conditions. However, changes in precipitation patterns, disturbance regimes, soil moisture, pest and disease outbreaks, and nonnative invasive species are expected to contribute forest vulnerability across the region. Northern, boreal, and montane forests have the greatest assessed vulnerability as many of their dominant tree species are projected to decline under warmer conditions. Coastal forests have high vulnerability, as sea level rise along the Atlantic coast increases damage from inundation, greater coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Considering these potential forest vulnerabilities and opportunities is a critical step in making climate-informed decisions in long-term conservation planning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).",2018,,Clim.

The images confirm that the coastal forest area declined 0.60% from 1982 to 2003, but degraded rapidly, by 7.44%, from 2010 to 2017. The forest declined most rapidly along waterways and at the coastal marsh-forest boundary. Additional time series of aerial-photographs corroborated the onset of degradation in 2010. Degradation continued through 2017 with no apparent recovery. Previous research from the area has concluded that increased tidal flooding and saltwater intrusion, of the coastal plain, represent a chronic stress driving coastal forest decline in this region, but these drivers do not explain the abrupt acceleration in forest die-off. Local tide gage data indicate that sea-level rise is 2 mm yr-1 and accelerating, while meteorological data reveal at least two short-term cold snap events, with extreme temperatures exceeding the reported temperature threshold of local vegetation (-10 °C) between January 2010 and January 2011, followed by more extremes in 2016. The Big Bend hardwood forest experienced acute cold snap stress during the 2010-2017 period, of a magnitude not experienced in the previous 20 years, that compounded the chronic stress associated with sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. This and other coastal forests can be expected to suffer further widespread and lasting degradation as these stresses are likely to be sustained. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,,Remote Sens.,10,11,,,10.3390/rs10111721,,#15444,McCarthy 2018,,

The developed model is referred to as the ‘reference’ model and calibrated against field-measured groundwater levels and a map of land use and land cover. Then, five prediction/projection models are developed based on modification of the boundary conditions of the calibrated ‘reference’ model to quantify climate change impacts under various scenarios of sea-level rise and precipitation change projected to 2050. Model results indicate that west Merritt Island will encounter lowland inundation and saltwater intrusion due to its low elevation and flat topography, while climate change impacts on Cape Canaveral Island and east Merritt Island are not significant.

201,Can beaches survive climate change?,"Vitousek, S.; Barnard, P.L.; Limber, P.","Anthropogenic climate change is driving sea level rise, leading to numerous impacts on the coastal zone, such as increased coastal flooding, beach erosion, cliff failure, saltwater intrusion in aquifers, and groundwater inundation. Many beaches around the world are currently experiencing chronic erosion as a result of gradual, present-day rates of sea level rise (about 3 mm/year) and human-driven restrictions in sand supply (e.g., harbor dredging and river damming). Accelerated sea level rise threatens to worsen coastal erosion and challenge the very existence of natural beaches throughout the world. Understanding and predicting the rates of sea level rise and coastal erosion depends on integrating data on natural systems with computer simulations. Although many computer modeling approaches are available to simulate shoreline change, few are capable of making reliable long-term predictions needed for full adaption or to enhance resilience. Recent advancements have allowed convincing decadal to centennial-scale predictions of shoreline evolution. For example, along 500 km of the Southern California coast, a new model featuring data assimilation predicts that up to 67% of beaches may completely erode by 2100 without large-scale human interventions. In spite of recent advancements, coastal evolution models must continue to improve in their theoretical framework, quantification of accuracy and uncertainty, computational efficiency, predictive capability, and integration with observed data, in order to meet the scientific and engineering challenges produced by a changing climate. ©2017.

202,Investigation and control of seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering climate change,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.","Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion. © IWA Publishing 2017.",2017,,Water Sci. Technol.

206,Visioning the Future: Scenarios Modeling of the Florida Coastal Everglades,"Flower, H.; Rains, M.; Fitz, C.","In this paper, we provide screening-level analysis of plausible Everglades ecosystem response by 2060 to sea level rise (0.50 m) interacting with macroclimate change (1.5 °C warming, 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and rainfall that either increases or decreases by 10%). We used these climate scenarios as input to the Ecological Landscape Model to simulate changes to seven interactive hydro-ecological metrics. Mangrove forest and other marine influences migrated up to 15 km inland in both scenarios, delineated by the saltwater front. Freshwater habitat area decreased by 25–30% under our two climate change scenarios and was largely replaced by mangroves and, in the increased rainfall scenario, open water as well. Significant mangroves drowned along northern Florida Bay in both climate change scenarios due to sea level rise. Increased rainfall of 10% provided significant benefits to the spatial and temporal salinity regime within the marine-influenced zone, providing a more gradual and natural adjustment for at-risk flora and fauna. However, increased rainfall also increased the risk of open water, due to water depths that inhibited mangrove establishment and reduced peat accumulation rates. We infer that ecological effects related to sea level rise may occur in the extreme front-edge of saltwater intrusion, that topography will control the incursion of this zone as sea level rises, and that differences in freshwater availability will have ecologically significant effects on ecosystem resilience through the temporal and spatial pattern of salinity changes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2017,,Environ.

209,Measuring climate change adaptation in pacific small island states: Nissology and success,"Schwebel, M.B.","Pacific small island states (PSIS) currently experience harsh impacts of a changing climate: sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, internal migration and displacement. Are adaptation strategies based upon island-centric principles more successful than those originating from a more continental point of view? This research examined the principles of island-centric thinking using an island-centric lens by which to determine ‘successful’ climate adaptation planning. The findings illustrate a statistically significant relationship between PSIS that have higher nissological (island-centric) levels displayed within their climate change action plans (CCAPs) and CCAPs that were found to be more successful. In other words, highly nissological states are forecasted to be more successful in planning for the current and future impacts of climate change than those with lower nissological scores. In total, nissology explains approximately 28.37% of a PSIS’s success. The policy relevance is rooted in the unique cultural, geographical, and social aspects of islands. Findings are applicable to other islands as well countries that share islander-based qualities.

In this study, a baseline model was developed based on FEMWATER to simulate the monthly variation of root zone salinity of a geo-typical area located at the Cape Canaveral Barrier Island Complex (CCBIC) of coastal east-central Florida (USA) in 2010. Based on the developed and calibrated baseline model, three diagnostic FEMWATER models were developed to predict the extent of SWI into root zone by modifying the boundary values representing the rising sea level based on various sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios projected for 2080. The simulation results indicated that the extent of SWI would be insignificant if SLR is either low (23.4 cm) or intermediate (59.0 cm), but would be significant if SLR is high (119.5 cm) in that infiltration/diffusion of overtopping seawater in coastal low-lying areas can greatly increase root zone salinity level, since the sand dunes may fail to prevent the landward migration of seawater because the waves of the rising sea level can reach and pass over the crest under high (119.5 cm) SLR scenario. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,,Sci.

The transmissivity and specific yield estimated from the existing database range from 10 to 810 m2/day and 0.08% to 10.92% respectively. After successful calibration with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.80, the values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the unconfined aquifer were set in the range 1.85-61.90 m/day and 0.006-0.24 respectively. After validating the model, it is applied for forecasting the aquifer’s response to anticipated future scenarios of groundwater draft, recharge rate and sea level rise. The findings of the study illustrate that saltwater intrusion is intensified in the area adjoining the tidal rivers, rather than that due to the sea alone. Of all the scenarios simulated, the immense negative impact on groundwater quality emerges due to overdraft conditions and reduced recharge with the areal extent of seawater intrusion exceeding about 67% (TDS>1 kg/m3).

The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems becomes a degraded forested wetland, where the combination of high levels of soil organic matter and elevated concentrations of halide ions creates a dynamic biogeochemical environment that may be a potential hotspot for halocarbon formation such as chloroform, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide. This study conducted field measurements at a transition zone in coastal South Carolina to quantify halocarbon exchange rates and laboratory soil incubations to determine the contributions of biotic versus abiotic processes. The degraded forested wetland showed significant chloroform emission rates (146 ± 129 nmol m-2 d-1). The degraded forested wetland remained a net sink for methyl chloride and a negligible source/sink for methyl bromide, unlike the saltmarsh which was a significant source for both. The laboratory incubations strongly suggest that methyl halide consumption in soils at the field site was biotic and that production of methyl halides and chloroform was largely abiotic and temperature-dependent, although additional experiments are required to rule out possible biotic production involving heat-resistant microbes. The results suggest that sea level rise and more frequent storm surges derived from global climate change, in the long term, may increase emissions of chloroform from coastal degraded forested wetlands and of methyl halides if salt marshes expand, with potential impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",2018,,ACS Earth Space Chem.,2,10,955-967,,10.1021/acsearthspacechem.8b00044,,#15475,Jiao 2018,,

The impact of rising sea level on the saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers has been studied for decades, but how human activities affect the extent of saltwater intrusion is poorly understood. Human activities are known to influence groundwater availability indirectly by affecting precipitation patterns and directly by extracting groundwater and reducing recharge. In this paper the authors investigated the integrated impacts of human activities and rising sea level on aquifer recharge in Quintana Roo, Mexico, by incorporating anthropogenic impacts on groundwater recharge into an analytical saltwater intrusion model. The impact of human activities on groundwater extraction was firstly calculated; then, the resulting groundwater recharge was used in a Ghyben–Herzberg analytical model to determine the inland distance of saltwater intrusion. The analytical model tested six scenarios stemming from different combinations of human development patterns, hydrological settings, hydraulic conditions and rising sea level to obtain the range of possible inland movement of saltwater intrusion. Our results indicate that the groundwater recharge will decrease to 32.6 mm year−1 if human activities increase by 50 % more. With 1-m sea level rise, inland saltwater intrusion distance is estimated to be up to 150 and 1 km under head-controlled and flux-controlled scenarios, respectively. A sensitivity analysis of the model reveals that the large hydraulic conductivity of the Quintana Roo aquifer (0.26–68.8 m s−1) is the most important factor in determining saltwater intrusion distance. Therefore, in this aquifer, the response to human activities is greatly exceeded by natural hydrogeological conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2017,,Nat.

226,Litter Decomposition of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus: Implications of Climate Change in Salt Marshes,"Wu, W.; Huang, H.; Biber, P.; Bethel, M.","Decomposition of plant litter in salt marshes plays an important role in coastal trophodynamics, nutrient cycling, sediment trapping, and short-term carbon storage, all of which are likely to be affected by climate change and accelerated sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, longer and more frequent inundation, and saltwater intrusion will all interact to affect decomposition of plant litter in a complex way. A combination of field experiments and model selection techniques was applied to study how these environmental factors affected litter decomposition of two dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results from summer field experiments conducted between June and August of 2013 showed that S. alterniflora in the low marsh had higher litter losses (0.286 ± 0.0883 g d-1, mean ± standard deviation) and decomposition coefficients (0.0115 ± 0.00416 d-1) than J. roemerianus in the midmarsh locations (0.0963 ± 0.0480 g d-1, 0.00416 ± 0.00223 d-1). Modeling results showed that the interaction between temperature and salinity significantly affected decomposition coefficients of both species positively during this experiment. This study suggests that accelerated leaf litter decomposition due to rising temperature and increased salinity will occur under climate change and sea-level rise, and this will potentially lead to important ecological consequences for salt marshes. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2017.",2017,,J.

The resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. To simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. The system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. During low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. This system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. Porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation. This porewater manipulation led to changes in the plant community and in exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane between the marsh and atmosphere. The system has proven to be a reliable way of manipulating wetland salinity for studying changes in the physicochemical environment. With modifications, it could be used to manipulate nutrient loads, hydrology, and sediment supply in other wetland systems. © 2016, Society of Wetland Scientists.",2016,,Wetlands,36,5,889-898,,10.1007/s13157-016-0801-4,,#15484,Lee 2016,,

The model was forced by observed winds, tidal elevation at open boundaries, and river discharges from eight inlets in the Pearl River Estuary. The agreements with observation were verified in terms of current, salinity and tide elevation. Using the computed tidal current, the residual current was also calculated to estimate material transport. In addition, the Lagrangian method was used to track the trajectory of particles from the mouth of Humen and Modaomen inlets. By computing the flushing time of these two channels, the authors find that there exists close relationship between flushing time and saltwater intrusion. Potential impact of sea-level rise on saltwater intrusion was also studied.

This problem motivated an integrated ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and sedimentological study of the Rømø Wadden Sea barrier island. Crossing W-E and N-S-oriented 100 MHz GPR reflection profiles with a total length of about 30 km were acquired on the island. In this case study, we process and analyze GPR data and investigate the feasibility of using integrated GPR and sedimentological log data to constrain spatial variations in lithology, structures and changing depositional environments of the Rømø barrier island. We document different standard processing steps which lead to increased signal-to-noise ratio, improved resolution and trustworthy GPR-to-borehole correlation. The GPR signals image the subsurface layering with a vertical resolution of ~ 0.2-0.3 m. The penetration depth of the GPR reflection signals varies between 7 and 15 m in the interior of the island where the shallow subsurface is not influenced by saltwater intrusion or fine-grained salt marsh sediments. Analysis of common midpoint reflection data constrains the radar wave velocity distribution in the subsurface and facilitates depth conversion of the reflection profiles. The GPR reflections are correlated with sedimentological facies logs, and we test to which extent it is possible to map the architecture of different sedimentary units of the Rømø barrier island based on joint interpretation of the GPR and core data. Detailed investigation of signal waveform variations and amplitude decay analysis are used for assessing lateral variation in lithology and composition. The combined GPR and borehole investigations constrain the nature of different marine and aeolian sedimentary sequences that have formed the barrier island system. We observe two prominent reflections which, in general, exhibit good continuity. The upper prominent reflection (0-2 m above present mean sea level (pmsl)) outlines swales and beach ridge flanks. In depressions (swales), this reflection has a complex signature originating from the contrasts in electrical properties caused by the presence of a thin layer of organic mud or gyttja. On the beach ridge flanks, this reflection has a simpler appearance and most likely represents contrasting sandy beds. The lower prominent reflection (0-3 m below pmsl) is relatively strong and represents the top of a clay layer in some areas. In other parts of the data set, this lower reflection is weaker and interpreted to represent the transition between two marine sand deposits of different origin. Mounded structures with internal dipping reflections are interpreted to represent a system of 20-40 m wide and up to ~ 2 m high fossil beach ridges in the shallow subsurface of the Rømø barrier island. The base of the beach ridges is found 0-1 m above pmsl. Some beach ridges show signs of erosion, and aeolian dunes have developed above them.

The US geological survey completed a hydrogeological investigation of the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer in 2012. Based on the hydrogeological data from the USGS investigation, the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer is classified as a two-layer aquifer. The first layer has a hydraulic conductivity of 58m/day for the first 100m below the water table and the second layer has a hydraulic conductivity of 7.6m/day for another 100m below the first layer. In 2007 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the sea level rise in the coastal areas for the US. For the Oxnard area, the most plausible sea level rise was computed to be 0.6m by 2040. This paper combines the information of sea level rise from IPCC and the hydrogeological information to examine the fresh-saltwater interface inland in the Oxnard-Mugu Aquifer. The U-tube model was used to determine the distribution of the fresh-saltwater interface in the aquifer. The results of this model compares closely with actual field observations of the interface using the data of salinity in the aquifer. © 2015 ASCE.",2015,,"World Environ. Water Resour.

246,Effects of sea-level rise on barrier island groundwater system dynamics - ecohydrological implications,"Masterson, J.P.; Fienen, M.N.; Thieler, E.R.; Gesch, D.B.; Gutierrez, B.T.; Plant, N.G.","We used a numerical model to investigate how a barrier island groundwater system responds to increases of up to 60 cm in sea level. We found that a sea-level rise of 20 cm leads to substantial changes in the depth of the water table and the extent and depth of saltwater intrusion, which are key determinants in the establishment, distribution and succession of vegetation assemblages and habitat suitability in barrier islands ecosystems. In our simulations, increases in water-table height in areas with a shallow depth to water (or thin vadose zone) resulted in extensive groundwater inundation of land surface and a thinning of the underlying freshwater lens. We demonstrated the interdependence of the groundwater response to island morphology by evaluating changes at three sites. This interdependence can have a profound effect on ecosystem composition in these fragile coastal landscapes under long-term changing climatic conditions. Published 2013.

247,Germination responses of the invasive triadica sebifera and two co-occurring native woody species to elevated salinity across a Gulf Coast transition ecosystem,"Paudel, S.; Battaglia, L.L.","With sea level rise, coastal ecosystems farther inland are expected to experience extended duration of inundation and elevated salinity. However, the effects of elevated salinity on initial recruitment of native and invasive woody species in coastal ecosystems are poorly understood. We assessed effects of elevated salinity across a range of soil types on germination of the invasive Triadica sebifera and two natives, Baccharis halimifolia and Morella cerifera, using growth chamber and greenhouse experiments. In both studies, germination was compared across four salinity levels (0, 10, 20, and 30 g/l). In the greenhouse, percent germination of these species was also compared across soils spanning the five dominant vegetation zones that define a typical coastal transition ecosystem in coastal Mississippi, USA. Final percent germination of all species decreased with increased salinities in both experiments. In the greenhouse, germination of all species was reduced in soils from the most seaward vegetation zones. Overall, there were species-specific germination responses to salinity treatments and soil types. Of the three species, B. halimifolia was least sensitive to increasing salinity. Germination of the invasive Triadica sebifera did not differ across salinity levels in inland soils, displaying plasticity of germination traits. This plasticity may increase the likelihood of successful germination under some degree of salinity stress, and thereby contribute to the inland spread of T. sebifera along coastal transition ecosystems. © 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.",2013,,Wetlands,33,3,527-535,,10.1007/s13157-013-0410-4,,#15505,Paudel 2013,,

Thus Aiguamolls de l'Empordà can be regarded as a key case study to assess current knowledge and perceptions of the potential climate change effects on the coastal population and economies in the Spanish Mediterranean region. This study finds out that it is essential to gather and integrate local traditional knowledge with scientific knowledge in order to develop successful responses to climate change. Furthermore, it supports the position that vulnerability analysis must be participatory and must include social, cultural, environmental, economic and political dimensions, like it was the case in this research.According to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, major climate change effects such as increase in air temperature over the past few decades, a decrease in precipitation but increase in its intensity, the increase in the severity of droughts, and the decrease in biodiversity and ecosystem services are the most pressing climate change effects and serious threats to the observed area. In addition to this, the location of the coastal municipalities (their exposure) also makes them directly vulnerable to coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and sea level rise. Stakeholders also found that climate change adaptation is needed and this finding may suggest that even if cost of adaptation is high, further losses to the economy and ecosystems might be even higher. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,,Ocean Coast.

255,A density-dependant finite element model for analysis of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Javadi, A.A.","Saltwater intrusion is a serious problem in coastal regions all over the world. It is one of the processes that degrade water-quality by raising salinity to levels exceeding acceptable drinking water standards. It may occur due to human activities and/or by natural events. Over-abstraction is considered the main cause of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea level rise speed up saltwater intrusion. This paper presents the development and validation of a coupled transient finite element model for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport in saturate and unsaturated soils with application to study saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The model includes coupling of water flow, air flow, heat flow and solute transport. Furthermore, transient density-dependent flow is included in the model and the dependency of dispersion on velocity is considered. Different mechanisms that govern solute transport in porous media including, advection, diffusion, dispersion, adsorption, chemical reactions and biological degradation are included in the model. The governing equation of the solute transport is solved together with three balance equations for water flow, air flow and heat transfer. The nonlinear system of governing differential equations is solved using the finite element method in the space domain and a finite difference scheme in the time domain. The model is validated by application to a standard case study from the literature (Henry's problem) and then applied to predict saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer. The results of the model predictions are presented and discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,,J. Hydrol.,401,3-4,259-271,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.02.028,,#15520,Abd-Elhamid 2011,,
256,Tidal Freshwater Wetlands: Variation and Changes,"Barendregt, A.; Swarth, C.W.","Tidal freshwater wetlands (TFW) are situated in the upper estuary in a zone bordered upstream by the nontidal river and downstream by the oligohaline region. Here, discharge of freshwater from the river and the daily tidal pulse from the sea combine to create conditions where TFW develop. TFW are often located where human population density is high, which has led to wetland degradation or destruction. Globally, TFW are largely restricted to the temperate zone where the magnitude of annual river discharge prevents saline waters from penetrating too far inland. The constant input of river water delivers high loads of sediments, dissolved nutrients, and other suspended matter leading to high sedimentation rates and high nutrient levels. Prominent biogeochemical processes include the transformation of nitrogen by bacteria and immobilization of phosphate. A diverse, characteristic vegetation community develops which supports a rich fauna. Biotic diversity is highest in the high marsh areas and decreases in the lower levels where tidal inundation is greatest. Benthic fauna is rather poor in diversity but high in biomass compared to other regions of the estuary. Global climate change is a threat for this system directly by sea level rise, which will cause brackish water to intrude into the fresh system, and indirectly during droughts, which reduce river discharge. Salinity will affect the presence of flora and fauna and facilitates sulfate reduction of organic matter in the soil. Increased decomposition of organic matter following saltwater intrusion can result in a lowering of wetland surface elevation. The papers assembled in this issue focus on how these tidal freshwater wetlands have changed over recent time and how they may respond to new impacts in the future. © 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",2013,,Estuar.

257,"Haloform formation in coastal wetlands along a salinity gradient at South Carolina, United States","Wang, J.-J.; Jiao, Y.; Rhew, R.C.; Chow, A.T.","Environmental contextNatural haloform emissions contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion but there are major unknown or underestimated sources of these gases. This study demonstrates that soil and water at tidal wetlands are important haloform sources, and emissions peak at the forest-marsh transition zone. The low-lying forested wetlands of the south-eastern United States that are facing sea-level rise and seawater intrusion may become hotspots for haloform emission. AbstractSoil haloform emissions are sources of reactive halogens that catalytically deplete ozone in the stratosphere but there are still unknown or underestimated haloform sources. The >200000ha of low-lying tidal freshwater swamps (forests and marshes) in the south-eastern United States could be haloform (CHX3, X≤Cl or Br) sources because sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion bring halides inland where they mix with terrestrial humic substances. To evaluate the spatial variation along the common forest-marsh salinity gradient (freshwater wetland, oligohaline wetland and mesohaline saltmarsh), we measured chloroform emissions from in situ chambers and from laboratory incubations of soil and water samples collected from Winyah Bay, South Carolina. The in situ and soil-core haloform emissions were both highest in the oligohaline wetland, whereas the aqueous production was highest in mesohaline saltmarsh. The predominant source shifted from sediment emission to water emission from freshwater wetland to mesohaline saltmarsh. Spreading out soil samples increased soil haloform emission, suggesting that soil pores can trap high amounts of CHCl3. Soil sterilisation did not suppress CHCl3 emission, indicating the important contribution of abiotic soil CHCl3 formation. Surface wetland water samples from eight locations along a salinity gradient with different management practices (natural v. managed) were subjected to radical-based halogenation by Fenton-like reagents. Halide availability, organic matter source, temperature and light irradiation were all found to affect the radical-based abiotic haloform formation from surface water. This study clearly indicates that soil and water from the studied coastal wetlands are both haloform sources, which however appear to have different formation mechanisms. © CSIRO 2016.",2016,,Environ.

This is due to a combination of factors including sea-level rise and tropical cyclones transporting saltwater upstream. The salination of drinking water is a problem that could affect millions of people living in coastal areas globally. Excess dietary intake of salt is strongly associated with high blood pressure and gastric cancer. Saltwater intrusion can also have a detrimental effect on crops and agriculture. Measurements of salinity in coastal areas are urgently needed to estimate the extent of the problem and the correlation of saline waters with health outcomes.

Aquifer heterogeneity is considered to investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the migration of salt plumes in the aquifer. A 1 m MSLR causes the saltwater/freshwater interface to migrate up to 1250 m landward, and the salinized area of the aquifer to expand up to 2050 m landward.

Three sites spaced along a longitudinal stream gradient were sampled from each of the Little Blackwater River and Blackwater River from December 2005 to December 2006. Salinity in upstream areas of Blackwater River ranged from 912 psu, while in the Little Blackwater River salinity ranged from 05 psu. Most of the spatial differences in assemblage structure occurred between upstream sites of Blackwater River, an area influenced by saltwater intrusion from the combined effects of sea level rise and a man-made canal, and upstream sites of Little Blackwater River. Freshwater-dependent fishes (e.g., brown bullhead and black crappie) dominated upstream sites of Little Blackwater River, whereas euryhaline species (e.g., killifish and silversides) dominated upstream sites of Blackwater River. We used the Little Blackwater River as a reference system to test the hypothesis that remnant freshwater-dependent fish populations of transitional areas in the Blackwater River may have declined as salinity levels increased. Upstream habitats of Blackwater River were brackish, while such habitats of Little Blackwater River were more persistently freshwater. As salinity increased seasonally in the Little Blackwater River, the abundance of freshwater-dependent fishes declined at two sites. Differences in species diversity and composition between Blackwater River and Little Blackwater River are likely associated with higher salinity and connectivity in upstream portions of the Blackwater River. © 2008 The Society of Wetland Scientists.",2008,,Wetlands,28,4,967-974,,10.1672/07-238.1,,#15532,Love 2008,,

Ever increasing demand on groundwater has led to overexploitation of the aquifers and degradation of groundwater quality. Climate change will exacerbate these problems by producing reduced recharge rates in some areas, more reliance on groundwater resources due to decrease in reliability of surface waters, farther inland penetration of saltwater intrusion in response to both sea-level rise and excessive groundwater extraction and deterioration of groundwater quality by increased flushing of urban and agricultural waste due to more frequent flooding. These problems emerged the concern about the sustainable management of groundwater so that it is not depleted while the increasing demand is satisfied under the pressures exerted by the climate change.

267,Can we save the California delta in the face of sea level rise?,"Roos, M.; de Vries, J.J.","Sea level rise would profoundly affect low-lying coastal and estuary regions of the world and especially the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta in California. This delta, the largest on the west coast of the US, has about 120 000ha below sea level, protected by levees, many on weak peat soil. The delta is also the hub of water transfer from north to south for two big water projects, which are vulnerable to ocean saltwater intrusion. Sea level has been rising slowly and is projected to rise more in the next 100years. This, coupled with continued subsidence, will make it more difficult to protect low-lying delta lands from inundation. The biggest threat is during high water storm events, but also a few summer dry season breaks have affected water exports. Since current rates of ocean rise are slow, a modest continuing effort in levee strengthening to handle a rise of 0.3 to 0.5cmyr-1 could maintain present levels of flood protection for decades.

269,Impact of sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Abd-Elhamid, H.F.; Javadi, A.A.","Climate change, sea level rise, over-pumping and saltwater intrusion present some of the future challenges of water resources management in coastal areas. Over-abstraction is considered one of the main causes of seawater intrusion and the rise in sea levels accelerates the intrusion. With the combined impact of sea level rise and over-pumping the problem becomes exacerbated and requires urgent solutions. Previous studies have mainly focused on the study of impact of sea level rise or over-abstraction on seawater intrusion separately and their combined effects have not been studied in the literature. This paper presents application of a coupled transient density-dependent finite element model to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers and investigates the individual and combined effects of likely sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion. Three scenarios are considered: rise in sea levels due to climate change, decline in groundwater table due to overpumping and combination of sea level rise and over-pumping. The results show that, in the case study considered in this paper, the rise in the sea level moved the transition zone inland by about 5%. However, the combination of sea level rise and over-pumping resulted in further inland movement of the transition zone (about 8%). The amount of intrusion greatly depends on the depth, size and properties of the aquifer. While the intrusion is a few metres in a small aquifer, it could be several kilometres in a large aquifer. © IWA Publishing 2011.",2011,,J. Water Clim.

270,Assessing impacts of sea level rise on seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer with sloped shoreline boundary,"Hussain, M.S.; Javadi, A.A.","This paper investigates the effect of gradual and instantaneous sea level rise (SLR) on the seawater intrusion (SWI) process in coastal aquifer systems with different levels of land-surface inundation. A set of hypothetical case studies with different shoreline slopes is used to conduct this numerical experiment. For the purpose of numerical modelling, a future rate of SLR from 2015 to 2100 is considered based on the moderate expectation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001). The gradual SLR is implemented in two different stages. First, continuous and nonlinear rising of sea level is imposed starting from year 2015 up to the end of the century. After that the final value of sea level is maintained as constant in order to assess the response time spanning to a new steady state condition. The effects of pumping resulting in lowering of groundwater level are also considered together with the dynamic variation of sea level. The results show that the rate and the amount of SWI are considerably greater in aquifers with flat shoreline slopes compared with those with steep slopes. Moreover, a shorter period of time is required to reach a new steady state condition in systems with flatter slopes. The SWI process is followed by a significant depletion in quantity of freshwater resources at the end of the century. The situation is exacerbated with combined action of SLR and over-abstraction. Finally, by considering the effect of inundation of the shoreline due to gradual SLR, the sensitivity of the system to the main aquifer parameters including molecular diffusion of solute, dispersion, hydraulic conductivity and porosity is investigated. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.",2016,,J.

Global warming induces steric as well as eustatic rise in sea-level, by thermal expansion and addition of ice-melt water, respectively. Although the IPCC (2007) estimated a maximum possible sea-level rise of about 59 cm, more recent estimates show a global average rise of ≥1 m by the 2100 AD. The low-lying coastal zones are more vulnerable to rising sea levels as they face submergence or saltwater intrusion which affects the agriculture activities. Geomatics-based models on the possible impact of the predicted sea-level rise on coastal agriculture are necessary to initiate appropriate mitigation plans. The present study is an attempt in this direction taking the Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast as an example. The land use / land cover of the AP coast was mapped through the interpretation of IRS-P6 LISS III imagery from 2008.

275,"Future vegetation patterns and primary production in the coastal wetlands of East China under sea level rise, sediment reduction, and saltwater intrusion","Ge, Z.-M.; Cao, H.-B.; Cui, L.-F.; Zhao, B.; Zhang, L.-Q.","To explore the effects of sea level rise (SLR), sediment reduction (SR), and saltwater intrusion (SWI) on the vegetation patterns and primary production of one exotic (Spartina alterniflora) and two native dominant (Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis) species in the coastal wetlands of East China, range expansion monitoring and stress experiments were conducted, followed by model prediction. After a rapid invasion period, the expansion rate of S. alterniflora slowed down due to the decreasing availability of suitable habitat under prolonged inundation. SLR was shown to decrease the colonization of S. alterniflora and the native P. australis up to 2100. In contrast, the native S. mariqueter that has a high tolerance of inundation increased in area following SLR, due to a reduction in competition from S. alterniflora in low-lying habitats and even recolonized areas previously invaded by the exotic species. The combination of SLR and SR resulted in further degradation of S. alterniflora and P. australis, while the area of S. mariqueter was not reduced significantly. The decrease in the area of vegetation would reduce the gross primary production under SLR and SR. SWI exacerbates the impacts, especially for P. australis, because S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter have a higher tolerance of salinity. Thus, the coastal vegetation pattern was predicted to be modified due to species-specific adaption to changed geophysical features. This study indicated that the native species better adapted to prolonged inundation and increased salinity might once again become key contributors to primary production on the muddy coasts of East China. ï¿½2015.

277,A geographic information systems approach to mitigating sea level rise: Examples from Bermuda,"Snow, R.; Snow, M.; Brisson, S.","Most island inhabitants, along with their infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, are situated just a few hundred meters from the shore and, as a result, are likely to experience negative impacts from rising sea levels. The destructive effects could include coastal flooding, loss of wetlands, saltwater intrusion, increased erosion, and higher storm surges. Projected sea level rise could seriously damage the socioeconomic growth of smaller island states, with practically every social and economic sector being disrupted. Smaller, low elevation islands might not have the physical size to deal with rising sea levels, and residents might be forced to relocate to other countries, which could have dire socioeconomic costs. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that a Geographic Information System (GIS) is an efficient instrument for conducting surveys and inventories to assess those small islands at higher risk and to develop mitigation strategies. Efficient monitoring requires the assessment of various coastal data baselines and the evaluation of subsequent alterations in spatial patterns. While monitoring involves real-time components, among the most powerful tools of a GIS are its modeling capabilities, which allow simulation of various climate change scenarios.

279,Climatic changes and groundwater resources in Africa,"Anwar Al-Gamal, S.; Sokona, Y.; Dodo, A.-K.","Purpose – This paper aims to understand the impacts of climate changes on groundwater resources in the African continent in which groundwater components constitute one of the most indispensable resources for development. Design/methodology/approach – Observed data are used for the first time to illustrate the manifested impacts of climate changes on the groundwater resources either directly or indirectly, this includes the comparison between isoheytal maps as well as water level data versus time. Findings – The results of the analysis suggest that climate change is likely to impact groundwater resources, either directly, e.g. via changing precipitation patterns, or indirectly, e.g. through the interaction of changing precipitation patterns via changing land-use practices and water demand. These changes may concern both groundwater quantity and quality. Climate change will affect groundwater recharge rates, i.e. the renewable groundwater resource, and groundwater levels. Any decrease in groundwater recharge will exacerbate the effect of sea-level rise. In inland aquifers, a decrease in groundwater recharge can lead to saltwater intrusion of neighbouring saline aquifers, and increased evapotranspiration in semi-arid and arid regions may lead to the salinisation of shallow aquifers. Originality/value – In Africa, climate change and variability have the potential to impose additional pressures on water availability, water accessibility and water demands which will directly be impacted on eradicating poverty as a direct consequence of climate changes on sustainable development in Africa.

280,Understanding the Behaviour of Gravity Currents in Tideless Estuaries and Considering the Impact of Sea Level Rise within the Nile Estuary,"Mahgoub, M.; Hinkelmann, R.; La Rocca, M.","Gravity currents are complex phenomena that occur in estuaries, and the complexity of these phenomena is even higher for tideless estuaries. To improve the process of understanding such phenomena, the three-dimensional TELEMAC3D modelling system was used to model the Nile estuary as an example of tideless estuaries. The nonhydrostatic simulation and the use of a complex turbulence model were necessary. The current mean flow conditions were modelled first; the results were then compared with three scenarios of sea level rise to study its impact. According to the model results, the salt wedge was not stagnant but fluctuated in cycle-like variations; the fluctuations were higher at the surface and smaller near the bottom, and at the end of the salt wedge, no fluctuations were noticed. The salt concentration and hence the density differs significantly throughout the salt wedge in the longitudinal direction as well as in the vertical direction. Changes in density in the lateral direction were also noticed; greater concentrations were at greater water depths for the same transverse section. The sea level rise caused greater saltwater intrusion inside the Nile and the greater the sea level rise, the more the intrusion increased. To maintain the current saltwater intrusion length without any increase, discharging additional water from the Edfina Barrage (the last barrage on Rosetta branch) could be used as a direct mitigation option; however, doing so, could have negative consequences on the water budget of the country. ©Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2015.",2015,,J.

Developing climate change scenarios, assessing impact of saltwater intrusion and flooding situations in further is essential and needed in this area. Due to sea level rise scenarios in 2030 and 2050 developed by Southern Institute of Water Resources Research (SIWRR), this research applied GIS methods to compare and evaluate the trend on salinity (concentration level, duration, extend) and inundation (depth, duration and extend) characteristics. The result showed that area of salinity level more than 8‰ is increasing from current condition of 2004 to year 2030 and 2050. These areas are mostly distribute on Kien Giang, Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Ben Tre and Soc Trang provinces with total areas about 1,131,134 ha. Inundation areas with level more than 2.5m and flooding duration from 5 to 6 months are also increasing following climate change scenarios in 2030 and 2050. Vulnerability area by effect of inundation is mainly distributed on Long An and Tien Giang province with around 312,770 ha (in year 2050). Soc Trang has the biggest vulnerable areas, which affected by flooding and salinity, following by Ca Mau and Bac Lieu and small areas in Ben Tre, Tien Giang.

291,Vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater use and climate change,"Ferguson, G.; Gleeson, T.","Climate change and human population growth are expected to have substantial impacts on global water resources throughout the twenty-first century. Coastal aquifers are a nexus of the world's oceanic and hydrologic ecosystems and provide a water source for the more than one billion people living in coastal regions. Saltwater intrusion caused by excessive groundwater extraction is already impacting diverse regions of the globe. Synthesis studies and detailed simulations have predicted that rising sea levels could negatively impact coastal aquifers through saltwater intrusion and/or inundation of coastal regions. However, the relative vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater extraction and sea-level rise has not been systematically examined. Here we show that coastal aquifers are more vulnerable to groundwater extraction than to predicted sea-level rise under a wide range of hydrogeologic conditions and population densities. Only aquifers with very low hydraulic gradients are more vulnerable to sea-level rise and these regions will be impacted by saltwater inundation before saltwater intrusion. Human water use is a key driver in the hydrology of coastal aquifers, and efforts to adapt to sea-level rise at the expense of better water management are misguided. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The model is applied to a conceptual field-scale aquifer to explore the sensitivity of the intrusion mechanism to various involved parameters. In all of the simulations, appropriate SLR rate has been applied to the sharp-interface model. The 90 years unsteady results showed that changes in hydraulic conductivity, rainfall recharge and freshwater inflow have significant effect on intrusion but the model is not very sensitive to different values of porous media porosity and specific yield. Afterward, the seaside saltwater head is raised and the toe of new time dependent salt wedge is determined. The results demonstrated that the SLR leads to more SWI. This excess intrusion is not very clear when SLR rate is low (e.g., 0.2 mm/year) but saltwater intrudes significantly further when the rate gets the higher values (e.g., 8 mm/year).

Numerous investigations confirm that the indirect effect may be more significant than the direct effects by the rising sea level in this century; that is, it increases salinity of rivers and estuaries. The implications of sea level rise for increasing of salinity were examined for four estuary branches in the Red River System in North Vietnam using Savenije's salt-intrusion model, based on salinity data acquired in the dry season of 2006. By correlative analysis of river discharge, tidal range, and geometric characteristics, the changes of salt intrusion length and longitudinal salinity profile were estimated for three different sea levels: M.S.L.+30 cm, +75 cm, and +100 cm.

297,Experimental and numerical investigation of saltwater intrusion dynamics in flux-controlled groundwater systems,"Chang, S.W.; Clement, T.P.","Sea level rise and reduction of groundwater fluxes due to changes in rainfall patterns are the two major climate change-induced hydrological variables that can severely affect saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. In this study we use a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to study the impacts of changes in one of these climate change-induced hydrological variables, groundwater flux, on saltwater intrusion process. We have completed experiments in a laboratory-scale model to study the changes in two types of groundwater fluxes - areal recharge flux and regional flux. The experimental results were modeled using the numerical code SEAWAT. The transient data sets reported in this study are useful benchmarks for testing numerical models that employ flux-type boundary conditions. Also, based on the experimental observations, we hypothesize that when the fluxes are perturbed, it would require relatively less time for a salt wedge to recede from an aquifer when compared to the time required to advance into the aquifer. This rather counterintuitive hypothesis implies that saltwater intrusion and receding processes are asymmetric and the timescales associated with these processes will be different. We use a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments to test this hypothesis and use the resulting data set to explain the reason for the difference in intrusion rates. © 2012.

298,Impacts of climate changes on water resources in africa with emphasis on groundwater,"Al-Gamal, S.; Dodo, A.-K.","Climate change is likely to impact groundwater resources, either directly, e.g. via changing precipitation patterns, or indirectly, e.g. through the interaction of changing precipitation patterns with changing land-use practices and water demand. These changes may affect both groundwater quantity and quality. Climate change will affect groundwater recharge rates and groundwater levels. Any decrease in groundwater recharge will exacerbate the effect of sea-level rise in coastal areas. In inland aquifers, a decrease in groundwater recharge can lead to saltwater intrusion from underlying saline aquifers, and increased evapotranspiration in semiarid and arid regions may lead to the salinization of shallow aquifers. In Africa, climate change and variability have the potential to impose additional pressures on water availability, water accessibility and water demand. A 1°C increase in temperature could change runoff by 10%, assuming that precipitation levels remain constant.

Global shoreline regression and sea-level rise have their own-bearing on the groundwater salinization due to seawater intrusion. A new adopted approach for vulnerability mapping using the hydrochemical investigations, geographic information system and a weighted multi-criteria decision support system (WMCDSS) was developed to determine the trend of groundwater contamination by seawater intrusion. Six thematic layers were digitally integrated and assigned different weights and rates. These have been created to comprise the most decisive criteria used for the delineation of groundwater degradation due to seawater intrusion. These criteria are represented by the total dissolved solids, well discharge, sodium adsorption ratio, hydrochemical parameter (Cl/HCO3), hydraulic conductivity and water types. The WMCDSS modeling was tried, where a groundwater vulnerability map with four classes ranging from very low to high vulnerability was gained. The map pinpointed the promising localities for groundwater protection, which are almost represented by the very low or low vulnerability areas (53. 69 % of the total study area). The regions having high and moderate groundwater vulnerability occupy 46. 31 % of total study area, which designate to a deteriorated territory of groundwater quality, and needs special treatment and cropping pattern before use. However, the moderate groundwater vulnerability class occupies an area of about 28.77 % of the total mapped area, which highlighted the need for certain management practices to prevent the saltwater intrusion from expanding further to the south. There was a good correlation of the constructed vulnerability map with the recently gathered water quality data and hydrochemical facies evolution.

It is widely assumed that this raise will have a severe adverse impact on saltwater intrusion processes in coastal aquifers. In this study we hypothesize that a natural mechanism, identified here as the "" lifting process,"" has the potential to mitigate, or in some cases completely reverse, the adverse intrusion effects induced by sea-level rise. A detailed numerical study using the MODFLOW-family computer code SEAWAT was completed to test this hypothesis and to understand the effects of this lifting process in both confined and unconfined systems. Our conceptual simulation results show that if the ambient recharge remains constant, the sea-level rise will have no long-term impact (i.e., it will not affect the steady-state salt wedge) on confined aquifers. Our transient confined-flow simulations show a self-reversal mechanism where the wedge which will initially intrude into the formation due to the sea-level rise would be naturally driven back to the original position. In unconfined systems, the lifting process would have a lesser influence due to changes in the value of effective transmissivity. A detailed sensitivity analysis was also completed to understand the sensitivity of this self-reversal effect to various aquifer parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,,Adv.

305,A salinity management model for restoration of a coastal riverine ecosystem,"Hu, G.G.","The Northwest Fork of the Loxahatchee River contains one of the last examples of a pristine subtropical riverine cypress swamp in South Florida. The permanent opening of the Jupiter Inlet along with sea level rise and reduced dry season freshwater flows in the Northwest Fork has allowed salt water to migrate upriver causing the introduction of mangroves into areas once dominated by freshwater floodplain swamp vegetation, particularly bald cypress. Restoration of this natural resource requires reducing or reversing the current condition of saltwater intrusion and maintaining the freshwater habitats in the upper reaches of the Northwest Fork to protect existing populations and distribution of wildlife that require freshwater habitat. A computer program was developed to predict salinity and calculate other performance parameters under various ecosystem restoration scenarios. Field data, regression analysis and results of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic computer models were integrated into a system simulation and management tool. Salinity prediction and other computations were conducted over a 39-year period. Such long-term simulations are required to investigate ecosystem response and assess the effectiveness of the proposed restoration approach. The model also contains system management functions such as the calculation of additional freshwater demand for salinity management under various restoration alternatives.

We here describe a comprehensive account of its biology and ecology, and discuss the management of this invasive plant. S. alterniflora was intentionally introduced to China in 1979 for the purposes of erosion check, soil melioration and dike protection. However, its rapid elongation rates, high leaf area indices, high photosynthetic rates, long photosynthetic season and clonal growth make S. alterniflora an aggressive competitor with native salt marsh plants in the coastal regions in China. The estimates made for the year 2002 show that S. alterniflora covered 112000 hectares throughout the eastern China, from Guangxi (21° N) to Tianjin (39° N), and is still spreading rapidly in the east coast of China. The successful invasion of S. alterniflora in non-native ranges is obviously the result of the interactions between its great invading ability and a high invasibility of the invaded ecosystems, which is further facilitated by human activities. On the basis of its population trend and potential impact on native ecosystems, S. alterniflora was officially placed on the list of most harmful invasive alien plants (nine species) in China in 2003. S. alterniflora invasions in the salt marshes have multiple effects on the abiotic and biotic properties and the functioning of the invaded ecosystems, including conversion of mudflats to Spartina meadows, loss of shorebirds' foraging habitats, alteration of ecosystem processes (e.g. carbon and nitrogen cycling), decrease in abundance of native species, degradation of native ecosystems and their functions, and considerable economic loss. It is predicted that the environmental changes driven by human activities in the coastal regions (e.g. eutrophication, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion) may favour its further invasions in coastal ecosystems in the future. Like other invasive species, it is quite difficult, expensive and even impossible to eradicate S. alterniflora once it has successfully invaded the coastal ecosystems. Obviously, further intentional introductions of S. alterniflora should be banned in China, and effective control measures should be urgently taken, to minimize the negative impacts of S. alterniflora on native ecosystems in China.",2006,,Acta Phytotaxonomica Sin.,44,5,559-588,,10.1360/aps06044,,#15594,Wang 2006,,

Three simulations were performed with varying rates of sea-level rise. For the first simulation, sea-level rise was specified at a rate of 0.9 mm/yr, which is the slowest rate of sea-level rise estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). After 100 years, the 250 mg/L chloride isochlor moved inland by about 40 m, and required an additional 8 years for the system to reach equilibrium.

Rainfall deficits accumulated since 1998 have led to a twofold increase in mean annual salinity in the study area, a wetland landbridge located in the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary in southeastern Louisiana. Global circulation models have predicted a rise in both the frequency and amplitude of extreme weather if global warming continues. This indicates a threat to the stability of deltaic plains, particularly those with altered hydrologies. Throughout the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain, river control structures have eliminated freshwater inputs. Generally, this should lead to increases in salinity that can become particularly acute during drought events. Such conditions have been shown to play a decisive role in plant community ecology, an important force in deltaic plain stability. Beyond certain thresholds; these conditions can have detrimental effects upon primary production. The accumulation of primary production deficits may lead to increases in the rate of relative sea-level rise.

Sea level rise results in an increased flow of fresh water toward the polder and a decreased flow toward the sea. An increase in recharge results in more water flowing toward both the polder and the sea.

In 2005, two such storms, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast of the US. Since September 2005, water samples have been collected from water wells impacted by the hurricanes' storm surges along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in southeastern Louisiana. The private and public water wells tested were submerged by 0.6-4.5 m of surging saltwater for several hours. The wells' casing and/or the associated plumbing were severely damaged. Water samples were collected to determine if storm surge water inundated the well casing and, if so, its effect on water quality within the shallow aquifers of the Southern Hills Aquifer System. In addition, the samples were used to determine if the impact on water quality may have long-term implication for public health. Laboratory testing for several indicator parameters (Ca/Mg, Cl/Si, chloride, boron, specific conductance and bacteria) indicates that surge water entered water wells' casing and the screened aquifer. Analysis of the groundwater shows a decrease in the Ca/Mg ratio right after the storm and then a return toward pre-Katrina values.

334,Development of the Volga Delta in response to Caspian sea-level fluctuation during last 100 years,"Li, C.X.; Ivanov, V.; Fan, D.D.; Korotaev, V.; Yang, S.Y.; Chalov, R.; Liu, S.G.","The Volga Delta developed in the closed Caspian basin can be classified as a river-dominated type. The subaqueous part of the delta (avandelta) is characterized by an extremely gentle slope and may be subdivided into shallow and deep parts. The very low-angle slope of the shallow avandelta is a major factor to mitigate impacts of Caspian sea- level (CSL) changes on the Volga Delta during the last 100 years. The CSL has fluctuated 3.46 m in the last 100 years, with a high of -25.55 m relative to the Baku Datum (BD) in 1903 and a low of -29.01 m BD in 1977. Sea-level changes can be grouped into three stages: (1) slowly falling at an average rate of 1.1 cm yr-1 in 1900-1929; (2) rapidly falling at an average rate of 6.3 cm yr-1 in 1930-1977; (3) rapidly rising at an average rate of 8.8 cm yr-1 in 1978-1999. During the rapid fall stage of sea level, the Volga delta-plain expanded at a rate of 2.3 km2yr-1 to 180 km2yr-1 because of alluvial accumulation and exposure of the shallow avandelta. Flourishing subaqueous vegetation promotes this expansion by trapping suspended sediments on the avandelta. The shallow avandelta is primarily covered by freshwater and its geomorphic and sedimentary features are controlled more by the river flow than by the CSL changes, waves or wind-induced currents. The shallow avandelta decelerated delta progradation during sea-level fall and delayed delta retreat during sea-level rise. Significant changes in the delta-plain area have not occurred in the rapid CSL rise stage. Moreover, the distributaries and their distal underwater channels underwent erosion by the river flow at least until the end of the last century. The CSL has risen with an average annual rate of 8.8 cm during the last 20 years, yet coastal erosion, coastal flooding, wetland loss and saltwater intrusion, observed in other deltas, have not occurred here. This may have resulted from the existence of the shallow avandelta and show that the world's deltas respond to sea-level rise in different ways.",2004,,J. Coast.

336,"Impacts of sea-level rise on groundwater environment in coastal areas: Laboratory experiments, numerical analyses, and a case study in Turkey","Fujinawa, K.; Furukawa, M.; Nagano, T.; Watanabe, T.","The impacts of sea-level rise in low lands and the effect of barrier walls for reducing saltwater intrusion were investigated by laboratory experiments. The experiments revealed that sea-level rise induce saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, which in turn reduces fresh groundwater resources, causes water logging, and accumulates salt on ground surface in arid regions. A numerical method, called SIFEC, for a variable-density flow model, which couples the saturated-unsaturated flow equation with the dispersive-convective equation, was also developed to apply for the problem. A Galerkin-finite element method was applied for fluid flow and a characteristic finite element method for mass transport. Numerical results were compared with the experimental results and the accuracy of the numerical scheme was examined. Copyright ASCE 2005.",2005,,World Water Congr. Impacts Global Clim. Change Proc.

The impact of climate change on freshwater resources in coastal aquifers is an area of active research that involves many detailed investigations. The sensitivity of coastal aquifers to both natural and human disturbance necessitates a careful and integrated study of their delicate nature. In addition to understanding the mechanism that governs saltwater intrusion, the techniques for optimal utilization of freshwater resources need to be devised.

338,GIS modeling and simulation of sea level rise scenarios,"Snow, M.M.; Snow, R.K.","Global mean sea level is projected to increase by approximately 0.5 meters within the next century. The results of this rise could include the substantial erosion of shorelines, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and estuaries, increased fluctuation of tides in bays and rivers, microbiological and chemical contamination in coastal areas, and the amplified intensity and frequency of coastal inundation. The recent tsunami disaster in Southeast Asia reinforces the importance of visualizing the scenarios that could occur as a result of rising seas. Innovative modeling techniques that could be efficiently incorporated into environmental and economic planning would be useful. A Geographic Information System (GIS) that can create, analyze, and display sea level rise scenarios would help local officials address the negative effects of elevated sea levels by allowing them to identify communities that are at risk, assess the situation, and develop mitigation strategies. This paper discusses the issue of rising sea levels at the global and regional scale and illustrates the necessity for public comprehension and involvement.

339,Monitoring sea level changes,"Gornitz, V.","Future sea level rise arouses concern because of potentially deleterious impacts to coastal regions. These will stem not only from the loss of land through inundation and erosion, but also from increased frequency of storm floods, with a rising base level, even with no change in storm climatology, and from saltwater intrusion and greater amounts of waterlogging. Current sea level trends are important in formulating an accurate baseline for future projections. Sea level, furthermore, is an important parameter which integrates a number of oceanic and atmospheric processes. The ocean surface demonstrates considerable variability on diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales, induced by winds, storm waves, coastal upwelling, and geostrophic currents. Secular trends in sea level arise from changes in global mean temperature and also from crustal deformation on local to regional scales. The challenge facing researchers is how best to extract the climate signal from this noise. This paper re-examines recent estimates of sea level rise, discusses causes of variability in the sea level records, and describes methods employed to filter out some of these contaminating signals. Evidence for trends in long-term sea level records and in extreme events is investigated.

With increase in global warming, sea level rise is expected to cross 5–8 mm/year in the near future, which will cause significant inundation, sea water intrusion, loss of strength and stability of coastal structures due to increased coastal erosion. It is time to strictly follow the concept of “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” in all aspects of coastal infrastructure.

348,Mobilization of technetium from reduced sediments under seawater inundation and intrusion scenarios,"Eagling, J.; Worsfold, P.J.; Blake, W.H.; Keith-Roach, M.J.","Predicted sea level rise would increase the vulnerability of low lying coastal legacy nuclear sites to inundation and intrusion with oxygenated seawater. This could have a significant impact on the mobility of redox-sensitive radionuclides such as Tc. Here, batch and column experiments were used to simulate and investigate the effect of these processes on the mobilization of Tc from sediments under a range of geochemically reduced conditions. Batch experiments showed that only a small proportion of Tc was rapidly (within 5 days) released from the sediments into seawater and groundwater. The subsequent Tc release was slowest and ultimately limited to the greatest extent (17%) in initially Fe-reducing sediments, when they were reoxidized in seawater. Thus, the cycling of iron and the impact of the water chemistry on iron mineralogy were important for hindering Tc release. Column experiments showed that iron minerals were less effective at retarding Tc release under flow-through conditions. Kinetically controlled and solubility limited Fe dissolution led to ongoing Tc release from the sediments; i.e. the retarding effect of iron phases was temporary, and significantly more Tc was mobilized (79-93%) compared with the batch experiments (17-45%). These results demonstrate the potential for Tc(IV) to be oxidized and mobilized from sediments at coastal nuclear sites resulting from predicted intrusion and inundation with oxic seawater. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",2012,,Environ.

Overall, increased NaCl-concentrations in aquifers and soil are found to increase the release of Pb and Hg into the water. Reducing environments and possible soil dispersion by hydrated Na+ are found to lead to an increase of As-concentration in water. However, the application of a pure NaCl salt solution in the column injection experiment was found to release less As, Pb, and Hg initially from the soil and delay their concentration increase, when compared to the application of CaCl2 and NaCl mixed salts (at 6:4 weight ratio). The concentration correlation dendrogram statistical analyses of the experimental and field data suggest that the release of As, Hg, and Pb into groundwater and the soil solution depends not only on the salt level and content, but also on the redox condition, dissolved organic matter contents, competitiveness of other ions for exchange sites, and source minerals. With the ongoing over-exploration of coastal aquifers from increased pumping, continued sea-level rise, and increased winter deicing salt applications in salted watersheds of many inland regions, the results of this study will help understand the complex relation between the concentrations of As, Pb, and Hg and increased salt level in a coastal aquifer and in soils of a salted watershed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015,,J.

351,Asesment of impact of climate change on ground water resources,"Kumar, C.P.","Climate change poses uncertainties to the supply and management of water resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the global mean surface temperature has increased 0.6 ± 0.2°C since 1861, and predicts an increase of 2 to 4°C over the next 100 years. Temperature increases also affect the hydrologic cycle by directly increasing evaporation of available surface water and vegetation transpiration. Consequently, these changes can influence precipitation amounts, timings and intensity rates, and indirectly impact the flux and storage of water in surface and subsurface reservoirs (i.e., lakes, soil moisture, groundwater). In addition, there may be other associated impacts, such as sea water intrusion, water quality deterioration, potable water shortage, etc. While climate change affects surface water resources directly through changes in the major long-term climate variables such as air temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration, the relationship between the changing climate variables and groundwater is more complicated and poorly understood. The greater variability in rainfall could mean more frequent and prolonged periods of high or low groundwater levels, and saline intrusion in coastal aquifers due to sea level rise and resource reduction. Groundwater resources are related to climate change through the direct interaction with surface water resources, such as lakes and rivers, and indirectly through the recharge process. The direct effect of climate change on groundwater resources depends upon the change in the volume and distribution of groundwater recharge. Therefore, quantifying the impact of climate change on groundwater resources requires not only reliable forecasting of changes in the major climatic variables, but also accurate estimation of groundwater recharge. A number of Global Climate Models (GCM) are available for understanding climate and projecting climate change. There is a need to downscale GCM on a basin scale and couple them with relevant hydrological models considering all components of the hydrological cycle. Output of these coupled models such as quantification of the groundwater recharge will help in taking appropriate adaptation strategies due to the impact of climate change. This paper presents the likely impact of climate change on groundwater resources and methodology to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater resources.",2012,,Water Energy Int.,69,8,25-31,,,,#15640,Kumar 2012,,
354,Vulnerability indicators of sea water intrusion,"Werner, A.D.; Ward, J.D.; Morgan, L.K.; Simmons, C.T.; Robinson, N.I.; Teubner, M.D.","In this paper, simple indicators of the propensity for sea water intrusion (SWI) to occur (referred to as ""SWI vulnerability indicators"") are devised. The analysis is based on an existing analytical solution for the steady-state position of a sharp fresh water-salt water interface. Interface characteristics, that is, the wedge toe location and sea water volume, are used in quantifying SWI in both confined and unconfined aquifers. Rates-of-change (partial derivatives of the analytical solution) in the wedge toe or sea water volume are used to quantify the aquifer vulnerability to various stress situations, including (1) sea-level rise; (2) change in recharge (e.g., due to climate change); and (3) change in seaward discharge. A selection of coastal aquifer cases is used to apply the SWI vulnerability indicators, and the proposed methodology produces interpretations of SWI vulnerability that are broadly consistent with more comprehensive investigations. Several inferences regarding SWI vulnerability arise from the analysis, including: (1) sea-level rise impacts are more extensive in aquifers with head-controlled rather than flux-controlled inland boundaries, whereas the opposite is true for recharge change impacts; (2) sea-level rise does not induce SWI in constant-discharge confined aquifers; (3) SWI vulnerability varies depending on the causal factor, and therefore vulnerability composites are needed that differentiate vulnerability to such threats as sea-level rise, climate change, and changes in seaward groundwater discharge. We contend that the approach is an improvement over existing methods for characterizing SWI vulnerability, because the method has theoretical underpinnings and yet calculations are simple, although the coastal aquifer conceptualization is highly idealized. © 2011, The Author(s).

357,Modeling the transient response of saline intrusion to rising sea-levels,"Webb, M.D.; Howard, K.W.F.","Sea levels are expected to rise as a result of global temperature increases, one implication of which is the potential exacerbation of sea water intrusion into coastal aquifers. Given that approximately 70% of the world's population resides in coastal regions, it is imperative to understand the interaction between fresh groundwater and sea water intrusion in order to best manage available resources. For this study, controlled investigation has been carried out concerning the temporal variation in sea water intrusion as a result of rising sea levels. A series of fixed inland head two-dimensional sea water intrusion models were developed with SEAWAT in order to assess the impact of rising sea levels on the transient migration of saline intrusion in coastal aquifers under a range of hydrogeological property conditions. A wide range of responses were observed for typical hydrogeological parameter values. Systems with a high ratio of hydraulic conductivity to recharge and high effective porosity lagged behind the equilibrium sea water toe positions during sea-level rise, often by many hundreds of meters, and frequently taking several centuries to equilibrate following a cease in sea-level rise. Systems with a low ratio of hydraulic conductivity to recharge and low effective porosity did not develop such a large degree of disequilibrium and generally stabilized within decades following a cease in sea-level rise. This study provides qualitative initial estimates for the expected rate of intrusion and predicted degree of disequilibrium generated by sea-level rise for a range of hydrogeological parameter values. © 2010 The Author(s).

363,Assessing water quality of the Chesapeake Bay by the impact of sea level rise and warming,"Wang, P.; Linker, L.; Wang, H.; Bhatt, G.; Yactayo, G.; Hinson, K.; Tian, R.","The influence of sea level rise and warming on circulation and water quality of the Chesapeake Bay under projected climate conditions in 2050 were estimated by computer simulation. Four estuarine circulation scenarios in the estuary were run using the same watershed load in 1991-2000 period. They are, 1) the Base Scenario, which represents the current climate condition, 2) a Sea Level Rise Scenario, 3) a Warming Scenario, and 4) a combined Sea Level Rise and Warming Scenario. With a 1.6-1.9°C increase in monthly air temperatures in the Warming Scenario, water temperature in the Bay is estimated to increase by 0.8-1°C. Summer average anoxic volume is estimated to increase 1.4 percent compared to the Base Scenario, because of an increase in algal blooms in the spring and summer, promotion of oxygen consumptive processes, and an increase of stratification. However, a 0.5-meter Sea Level Rise Scenario results in a 12 percent reduction of anoxic volume. This is mainly due to increased estuarine circulation that promotes oxygen-rich sea water intrusion in lower layers. The combined Sea Level Rise and Warming Scenario results in a 10.8 percent reduction of anoxic volume. Global warming increases precipitation and consequently increases nutrient loads from the watershed by approximately 5-7 percent. A scenario that used a 10 percent increase in watershed loads and current estuarine circulation patterns yielded a 19 percent increase in summer anoxic volume, while a scenario that used a 10 percent increase in watershed loads and modified estuarine circulation patterns by the aforementioned sea level rise and warming yielded a 6 percent increase in summer anoxic volume.

367,A numerical investigation of the mechanisms controlling salt intrusion in the Delaware Bay estuary,"Cook, S.E.; Warner, J.C.; Russell, K.L.","Salinity intrusion in coastal systems is mainly controlled by freshwater inflows. However, extreme events like drought, low-pressure storms, and longer-term sea level rise can exacerbate the landward salt migration and threaten economic infrastructure and ecological health. Along the eastern seaboard of the United States, approximately 13 million people rely on the water resources of the Delaware River basin. Salinity intrusion is actively managed through river discharge targets to suppress the propagation of the salt front (∼0.52 daily averaged psu line). The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms controlling the location of the salt front in the Delaware Bay estuary using a calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave and Sediment Transport modeling system. This study explored how river discharge, tidal motions, interactions with bathymetric and topographic features, and meteorological events affected the location of the salt front. The model was forced with tides, subtidal water levels, bulk atmospheric conditions, and waves. Compared with the observationally derived location of the salt front line, the model captured the major dynamics throughout the year and performed particularly well during times of low discharge, when salinity intruded up estuary at a constant rate of 0.4 km/day. The daily average salt front moved almost 16 km (10 mi) within a neap-spring tidal cycle, and low-pressure storm systems were found to move the daily averaged salt front by 13–16 km in one event. © 2023",2023,,Estuar.

Instead of trying to train the environment, the VMD farmers have adopted new adaptive livelihood models that promote more harmonious strategies to live with nature, seeking the compromising point between generating income and restoring the environmental benefits. The focus of this paper is one such approach, the ecological shrimp farming model of Ben Tre province. Presented herewith is the authors' viewpoint regarding the barriers and opportunities to develop the eco-agritourism model based on the ecological shrimp farming model in the VMD. We took note of the standing challenges for the farmers in sustaining their farms, both technically and financially. From the follow-up PRA, we contributed the evaluation of the potentials in incorporating ecotourism into the existing ecological shrimp farms. The findings are non-exhaustive, however, are significant to both decision-makers and scientific communities. As for the former, tourism development lies within the socio-economic development plan of Ben Tre province; this paper will be useful to communicate with policy planners of a note-worthy emerging ecotourism model. We also remarked on the community needs and expectations for the government. We also discussed the possibility of upscaling the eco-agritourism model via the channel of EBA research and development schemes while contributing to multiple SDGs.

Despite this, research on health effects of saline contaminated water is scarce in this region. This study examines the risk of hospital admission for hypertension in salinity-affected areas of the MDR. Methods Cases and controls were obtained from national/provincial hospital admission records for 2013. The cases were adult patients whom hypertension (ICD10-code: I10-I15) was primary diagnosis for admission. Of the 13 provinces in the MDR, we identified seven as 'salinity exposed' and the remaining as 'non-exposed' areas. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to examine the association between salinity exposure and hypertension outcome. Results Of the total 573 650 hospital admissions, 22 382 (∼3.9%) were hypertensive cases. The multi-level logistic model combining both individual and ecological factors showed a 9% increase in risk (95% CI: 3-14%) of hypertension admission among individuals in exposed areas compared to those in non-exposed areas. Conclusion In order to develop and promote appropriate adaptation strategies, further research is recommended to identify the salt exposure pathways and consumption behaviours in the salinity exposed areas. © The Author 2017.

376,Perceived farm-level climatic impacts on coastal agricultural productivity in Bangladesh,"Hasan, M.K.; Kumar, L.","Coastal farmers are the first group of people who feel climate-related calamities most severely, such as sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, coastal flooding, tidal surges and tropical cyclones. They are operating agricultural activities under these climatic conditions that affect farm productivity. This study explores farmer perceptions of changes in farm productivity and perceptions of causes of decreased farm productivity (if any) over the past 10 years compared with more than 10 years back. We partitioned the causes of decreased farm productivity into climatic and non-climatic based on the primary data collected through household survey in ten coastal subdistricts along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. We visited 381 households during September–October 2018 using a pre-tested structured interview schedule. Average monetary farm productivity in the study area was 1.98. A small proportion (11%) of the sampled farmers mentioned that farm productivity had decreased over the past years. A majority (64%) of them believed that climate change was responsible for such decreases in farm productivity. The farmers who thought that climate change was causing the decreased farm productivity were characterized by greater education, more awareness of climate change, less communication with extension agents, stronger belief in decreased cyclone and salinity, and weaker belief in decreased flood. The farmers perceived that dry period salinity, flood and coastal inundations were the major products of climate change to adversely affect crop productivity. Since agricultural adaptation to climate change requires clear understanding of the climatic impacts on farm productivity, and more than one-third of the farmers failed to identify climatic impacts on decreased farm productivity, their improvement of climate change awareness is essential. Extension organizations and other agents should promote updated climate knowledge among farmers to make them more aware of climate change issues, so that they can adapt to climate change through their agricultural activities. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",2020,,Clim.

This will cause severe environmental consequences because salinity can be detrimental to agriculture, aquaculture and human consumption. Tidal dynamics are important in regulating salinity in river deltas. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of different tidal amplitudes on deltas’ salinity. This paper investigates the impact of various tidal amplitudes on the spatiotemporal salinity distribution in deltas through three-dimensional idealized modelling. Numerical simulations are carried out with a common hydrograph and different tidal ranges. Both tide-influenced and river-dominated cases were considered. Results suggest that small increases in the tidal amplitude in river-dominated or low tidal regimes cases can have positive effects against salinization. Tide-induced mixing helps to increase freshwater areas and volumes. The water in the delta remains fresh for longer periods in scenarios representative of microtidal regimes. Further increases in the tidal amplitude to meso- and macrotidal levels reverse these effects and reduce freshwater areas and volumes. Results were used to test how salinity correlates with channel orders and river discharge in the presence of tides. These correlations are controlled more by bathymetry than tidal forcing. This study provides important insights into how changes in tidal range could impact spatiotemporal salinity distributions in deltas. © 2022, The Author(s).",2023,,Estuar.

While the existing literature predominantly points the cause of drought to the hydropower dams in the upstream of the Mekong Basin, we contribute new physical evidence of the intensification of saline water intrusion (through backwater effect) in the VMD caused by three anthropogenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed mining and dam construction), sea level rise and land subsidence. Thereupon, we highlight that it is critical to not underestimate the impacts from the localized factors, especially the riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. Our analysis is based on the extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series from 11 gauge stations across the VMD. First, several signs of significantly increased tidal amplification (up to 66%) were revealed through the spectral analysis of the hourly water level data. This trend was further validated through the changes in slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones, implying the relationships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in VMD and the lowered water levels caused by the riverbed incision. Finally, we introduce a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the riverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of their relative contributions to the balance between fresh and saline water in the VMD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,Sci.

382,"Simulating future flows and salinity intrusion using combined one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling-the case of Hau River, Vietnamese Mekong Delta","Anh, D.T.; Hoang, L.P.; Bui, M.D.; Rutschmann, P.","Salinity intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) has been exacerbated significantly in recent years by the changing upstream inflows, sea level rise resulting from climate change, and socioeconomic development activities. Despite significant damage to agricultural production and freshwater supplies, quantitative assessments of future flows and salinization remain limited due to lack of observation data and modelling tools to represent a highly complex hydraulic network. In this study, we combine 1D-MIKE 11 and 2D-MIKE 21 hydrodynamic models to simulate future flows, water level and salinity intrusion in the Hau River-one main river branch in the Mekong Delta. Future hydrological changes are simulated under multiple scenarios of upstream inflow changes, climate change and sea level rise for the 2036-2065 period. We first use the 1D-MIKE 11 to simulate the flow regime throughout the whole VMD using upstream discharges, outlet water levels and rainfall data as boundary conditions. Output from this step is then used to force the 2D-MIKE 21 model to estimate flow velocity, water level and salinity concentration in the Hau River, focusing on the salinization-prone section between Can Tho, Dinh An, and Tran De estuaries. Simulation results show that salinization will increase substantially, characterized by (1) higher salinity intrusion length under spring tide from 6.78% to 7.97%, and 8.62% to 10.89% under neap tide; and (2) progression of the salinity isohalines towards the upper Mekong Delta, from 3.29 km to 3.92 km for 1 practical salinity unit (PSU) under spring tide, and 4.36 km to 4.65 km for 1 PSU concentration under neap tide. Additionally, we found that salinity intrusion will make it more difficult to re-establish the freshwater condition in the estuary in the future. In particular, the flushing time required to replace saltwater with freshwater at the estuaries tends to increase to between 7.27 h for maximum discharge of 4500 m3/s and 58.95 h for discharge of 400 m3/s under the most extreme scenario. Increasing salinization along the Hau River will have important consequences for crop production, freshwater supplies and freshwater ecosystems, therefore requiring timely adaptation responses. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,,Water,10,7,,,10.3390/w10070897,,#15680,Anh 2018,,
388,"Modeling the Influence of River Flow and Salt Water Intrusion in the Terengganu Estuary, Malaysia","Lee, H.L.; Tangang, F.; Hamid, M.R.; Benson, Y.; Razali, M.R.","Salinity intrusion is a major concern when the freshwater extraction station is located in the estuary. This paper attempt to predict the salt intrusion length in the upper stretch of estuary, by applying different magnitudes of freshwater discharge at the river regime. The integrated two dimensional hydrodynamics model associated with advection dispersion model was performed to investigate the salinity intrusion. The model was well calibrated and verified by the measured data undertaken during dry season. The maximum salt intrusion length to the threshold of salinity density is 1.00 ppt on the existing condition was predicted at 9.97 km from the river mouth. Moreover, with the magnitude of 100.00 m3s-1 and 30.00 m3s-1 freshwater discharges at the upstream boundary (Kpg Tanggol), it was predicted the maximum salt intrusion length was 11.84 km and 21.41 km, respectively, from the river mouth. Therefore, it was determined the minimum freshwater discharge of approximately 100.00 m3s-1 is required at the Kpg Tanggol river gauging station, in order to maintain the acceptable salinity levels at the Pulau Musang freshwater pump house. However, the actual water discharge at the Kpg Tanggol boundary station should be higher, since the minimum discharge does not take into consideration the amount of water extraction by the Pulau Musang and SATU pump stations. Further analysis is required to execute the consequences of water extraction toward the salinity intrusion in the Terengganu estuary that coupled with projected sea level rise. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2016,,IOP Conf.

Given that losses of agricultural productivity and shortages of freshwater resources are projected, a reliable early warning of salinity invasion is, therefore, crucially needed. To evaluate the impact of salinity variations on riverine ecosystems, distribution patterns of meiofauna were examined at 20 stations along the Van Uc River continuum in the dry season. Meiofaunal richness indices were higher in the estuary and slightly decreased upriver. Nematoda was the most dominant taxon in salty stations, while Rotifera was more abundant in the less salty ones. A multiple variate analysis showed a strong interplay among salinity, nutrients, and pore water conductivity, which shaped the meiofaunal distribution. The inclusion of pore water salinity, nutrients, and meiofaunal community structure indicated a greater extent of the saline ecosystem in the estuary, posing a greater risk of freshwater salinization. Our results highlight the potential role of meiofauna as bioindicators but also call for a reformation of salinity assessment for better freshwater conservation and management. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Water,15,7,,,10.3390/w15071278,,#15694,Nguyen 2023,,
396,Changing Tides: The Role of Natural and Anthropogenic Factors,"Talke, S.A.; Jay, D.A.","Tides are changing worldwide at rates not explained by astronomical forcing. Rather, the observed evolution of tides and other long waves, such as storm surges, is influenced by shelf processes and changes to the roughness, depth, width, and length of embayments, estuaries, and tidal rivers. In this review, we focus on processes in estuaries and tidal rivers, because that is where the largest changes to tidal properties are occurring. Recent literature shows that changes in tidal amplitude have been ubiquitous worldwide over the past century, often in response to wetland reclamation, channel dredging, and other environmental changes. While tidal amplitude changes are sometimes slight (<1%) or even negative, we identify two types of systems that are particularly prone to tidal amplification: (a) shallow, strongly damped systems, in which a small increase in depth produces a large decrease in effective friction, and (b) systems in which wave reflection and resonance are strongly influenced by changes to depth, friction, and convergence. The largest changes in amplitude occur inland, some distance from the coast, and can sometimes be measured in meters. Tide changes are a leading indicator that the dynamics of storm surges and river flood waves have also changed and are often associated with shifts in sediment transport, salinity intrusion, and ecosystem properties. Therefore, the dynamics of tidal evolution have major implications for coastal management, particularly for systems that are sensitive to changes in geometry induced by sea-level rise and anthropogenic development. © 2020 by Annual Reviews.

398,Sensitivity of Circulation in the Skagit River Estuary to Sea Level Rise and Future Flows,"Khangaonkar, T.; Long, W.; Sackmann, B.; Mohamedali, T.; Hamlet, A.F.","Future climate simulations based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenario (A1B) have shown that the Skagit River flow will be affected, which may lead to modification of the estuarine hydrodynamics. There is considerable uncertainty, however, about the extent and magnitude of resulting change, given accompanying sea level rise and site-specific complexities with multiple interconnected basins. To help quantify the future hydrodynamic response, we developed a three-dimensional model of the Skagit River estuary using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). The model was set up with localized high-resolution grids in Skagit and Padilla Bay sub-basins within the intermediate-scale FVCOM based model of the Salish Sea (greater Puget Sound and Georgia Basin). Future changes to salinity and annual transport through the basin were examined. The results confirmed the existence of a residual estuarine flow that enters Skagit Bay from Saratoga Passage to the south and exits through Deception Pass. Freshwater from the Skagit River is transported out in the surface layers primarily through Deception Pass and Saratoga Passage, and only a small fraction (∼ 4%) is transported to Padilla Bay. The moderate future perturbations of A1B emissions, corresponding river flow, and sea level rise of 0.48 m examined here result only in small incremental changes to salinity structure and interbasin freshwater distribution and transport. An increase in salinity of ∼1 psu in the near-shore environment and a salinity intrusion of approximately 3 km further upstream is predicted in Skagit River, well downstream of drinking water intakes. © 2016 by the Northwest Scientific Association.",2016,,Northwest Sci.,90,1,94-118,,10.3955/046.090.0108,,#15702,Khangaonkar 2016,,

The results of calibration and validation water level showed a high conformity about phase and water amplitude between calculated and observed data. The effect of global warming on salinity intrusion in estuarine areas was simulated in this study. The results of current state scenario (2010) and climate change scenario in 2020, 2050 and 2100 showed an overall effect of salinity intrusion process on precipitation and sea level rise. The distance of salinity intrusion in the river is increasing and this could be detrimental to the economic development, especially for the agriculture sector. The rise in sea level due to global warming will not significantly affect the situation of salinity intrusion for Ca River in 2020.

400,What Determines Water Temperature Dynamics in the San Francisco Bay-Delta System?,"Vroom, J.; van der Wegen, M.; Martyr-Koller, R.C.; Lucas, L.V.","Water temperature is an important factor determining estuarine species habitat conditions. Water temperature is mainly governed by advection (e.g., from rivers) and atmospheric exchange processes varying strongly over time (day-night, seasonally) and the spatial domain. On a long time scale, climate change will impact water temperature in estuarine systems due to changes in river flow regimes, air temperature, and sea level rise. To determine which factors govern estuarine water temperature and its sensitivity to changes in its forcing, we developed a process-based numerical model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) and applied it to a well-monitored estuarine system (the San Francisco Estuary) for validation. The process-based approach allows for detailed process description and a physics-based analysis of governing processes. The model was calibrated for water year 2011 and incorporated 3-D hydrodynamics, salinity intrusion, water temperature dynamics, and atmospheric coupling. Results show significant skill in reproducing temperature observations on daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. In North San Francisco Bay, thermal stratification is present, enhanced by salinity stratification. The temperature of the upstream, fresh water Delta area is captured well in 2-D mode, although locally—on a small scale—vertical processes (e.g., stratification) may be important. The impact of upstream river temperature and discharge and atmospheric forcing on water temperatures differs throughout the Delta, possibly depending on dispersion and residence times. Our modeling effort provides a sound basis for future modeling studies including climate change impact on water temperature and associated ecological modeling, e.g., clam and fish habitat and phytoplankton dynamics. © 2017.

A central question is: Can we use existing knowledge and future projections to predict and manage the anticipated ecological impacts? This was the subject of a 2018 symposium entitled “Ecological and Physiological Impacts of Salinization of Aquatic Systems from Human Activities.” The symposium brought together an inter-disciplinary group of scientists and researchers, resource managers, and policy-makers. Here, we summarize and review the presentations and discussions that arose during the symposium. From a historical perspective, salt intrusion has changed substantially over the past 10,000 years as a result of changing climate patterns, with additional shifts from recent anthropogenic effects. Current salinity patterns in the San Francisco Estuary are driven by a suite of hydrodynamic processes within the given contexts of water management and geography. Based on climate projections for the coming century, significant changes are expected in the processes that determine the spatial and temporal patterns of salinity. Given that native species—including fishes such as the Delta Smelt and Sacramento Splittail—track favorable habitats, exhibit physiological acclimation, and can adaptively evolve, we present a framework for assessing their vulnerability to altered salinity in the San Francisco Estuary. We then present a range of regulatory and structural management tools that are available to control patterns of salinity within the San Francisco Estuary. Finally, we identify major research priorities that can help fill critical gaps in our knowledge about future salinity patterns and the consequences of climate change and sea level rise.

In this paper, we discuss all pertinent issues related to the sustainability of coastal agriculture under climate change. It is evident that some climate-change-related impacts (e.g., temperature and rainfall) on agriculture are similarly applicable to both coastal and non-coastal settings, but there are other factors (e.g., inundation, seawater intrusion, soil salinity and tropical cyclones) that particularly impact coastal agricultural sustainability. Coastal agriculture is characterised by low-lying and saline-prone soils where spatial competition with urban growth is an ever-increasing problem. We highlight how coastal agricultural viability could be sustained through blending farmer perceptions, adaptation options, gender-specific participation and integrated coastal resource management into policy ratification.

First, the shape of the arrested salt wedge was computed for different hydrographic conditions. Next, the response of the salt wedge to highly variable river flow was investigated. Finally, this model was applied to predict the impacts of the SLR on salinity intrusions in the Rječina River Estuary. To assess the model performance and to examine the salinity structure in the estuary, a field-sampling campaign was conducted during 2014 and 2015. Field observations revealed negligible longitudinal density variations in both freshwater and saltwater layers and highly stratified conditions for all considered river flow rates and sea levels. Furthermore, the maximum buoyancy frequency, computed as a measure of vertical stratification, was among the highest ever reported in field investigations. The behavior of the salt-wedge intrusion depends mainly on the river flow rate, although sea level and channel geometry become more influential under low-flow conditions. Computed salt-wedge shapes and propagation rates agreed well with field observations. The salinity structure in the Rječina River Estuary is not expected to change in the future for tested SLR scenarios, although stronger salt-wedge intrusion is predicted by the numerical model. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2017.",2017,,J.

The Coos Estuary offers a useful example of how these changes, common to diverse global estuaries, have altered tidal and salt dynamics, with implications for estuarine habitats. In the past 150 years, the primary navigation channel has been deepened from ~ 6.7 to 11 m, generating a 12% decrease in estuary area and 21% increase in volume. To evaluate the present and future impacts on the Coos and similar estuaries, a hydrodynamic model was implemented using a detailed bathymetric dataset compiled from multiple data sources including agency charts, water-penetrating lidar, and single-beam-sonar small-vessel surveys. The model was then re-run using grids constructed from 1865 survey data and a future proposed dredging plan. Changes in the hypsometry from 1865 to present have driven a 33% increase in tidal amplitude, an 18% increase in salinity intrusion length, a doubling of the subtidal salt flux, and an increase in ebb dominance of currents. A proposed channel-depth increase from 11 to 14 m is predicted to generate a negligible change in tidal range and a small increase in the salinity intrusion length. These results highlight the utility of curating high-resolution bathymetric datasets for coastal management applications through modeling.

429,Salt wedge dynamics lead to enhanced sediment trapping within side embayments in high-energy estuaries,"Yellen, B.; Woodruff, J.D.; Ralston, D.K.; MacDonald, D.G.; Jones, D.S.","Off-river coves and embayments provide accommodation space for sediment accumulation, particularly for sandy estuaries where high energy in the main channel prevents significant long-term storage of fine-grained material. Seasonal sediment inputs to Hamburg Cove in the Connecticut River estuary (USA) were monitored to understand the timing and mechanisms for sediment storage there. Unlike in freshwater tidal coves, sediment was primarily trapped here during periods of low discharge, when the salinity intrusion extended upriver to the cove entrance. During periods of low discharge and high sediment accumulation, deposited sediment displayed geochemical signatures consistent with a marine source. Numerical simulations reveal that low discharge conditions provide several important characteristics that maximize sediment trapping. First, these conditions allow the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) to be located in the vicinity of the cove entrance, which increases sediment concentrations during flood tide. Second, the saltier water in the main channel can enter the cove as a density current, enhancing near-bed velocities and resuspending sediment, providing an efficient delivery mechanism. Finally, higher salinity water accumulates in the deep basin of the cove, creating a stratified region that becomes decoupled from ebb currents, promoting retention of sediment in the cove. This process of estuarine-enhanced sediment accumulation in off-river coves will likely extend upriver during future sea level rise. © 2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",2017,,J.

It has been widely studied and continues to attract research attention. Advances typically apply partial frameworks to analyze factors that contribute to salinity intrusion. Such frameworks frequently overlook their interaction and occasionally oversimplify the aquifer dynamics. Studied factors include geology, geometry and hydraulics, tides, waves, sea-level rise and overexploitation, and rarely consider land subsidence. This study provides a unifying framework that integrates influencing factors including land subsidence. It explores the factor's relevancy based on latest literature, data requirements, common assumptions, frequently used algorithms, and challenges to integrate factors and driving forces. It also synthesizes key stages to model salinity intrusion. Discussing each stage to feature advancements and knowledge gaps. Critical findings include homogeneous and heterogeneous geology that are evenly considered with advances currently towards the investigation of high heterogeneities. The latter increases dispersion and reduces the horizontal solute transport.43% of studies featuring seashore slopes found that flat slopes can enhance salinity intrusion up to 30%. In some studies, different factors have been coupled, for example, waves and tides; sea-level rise and tides; and sea-level rise and land surface inundation. By coupling land surface inundation and the upper saline plume, some studies found an increase in salinity concentration. 36% of studies coupled them with shoreline slope and three considered high heterogeneities. The interaction modifies the solute distribution and salinity concentration. In addition, it is evident that land subsidence of 1.5 and 2 mm/year can enhance the salinity intrusion when considering the relative rise of the sea level, and it can affect properties such as porosity and permeability. Our research group is currently working on applying this framework to integrate factors and driving forces, identify their relevance and to consider land subsidence impact on the aquifer's structure. This framework facilitates the accurate modelling of salinity intrusion, advising the detailed analysis of each proposed stage to better represent and solve a targeted problem. © 2021",2022,,J.

435,Developed river deltas: Are they sustainable?,"Loucks, D.P.","Background. Coastal river deltas provide multiple ecosystem services. Many deltas serve as major centers of agriculture, industry and commerce. The annual economic benefits derived from major deltas are often a substantial fraction of a country's GDP. Yet, many deltas are losing land due to erosion, subsidence and subsequent flooding. Such vulnerabilities are often increased due to local land and water management decisions, relative sea-level rise, and increases in climate extremes. Aim of this review. Considerable literature exists addressing the formation of deltas and the effects of increasing urbanization, industrialization and crop and fish production, increases in relative sea level rise, and decreasing sediment deposition. This leads to the question: Are the economic, environmental, ecological and social benefits derived from developed river deltas sustainable? This review focuses on this question. Methods/Design. Over 180 published documents were identified and reviewed using various search engines and key words. These key words included river deltas; delta sustainability, vulnerability, resilience, coasts, ecology, hazards, erosion, water management, urbanization, reclamation, agriculture, governance, pollution, geomorphology, economic development, socio-economic changes, and delta wetlands; relative sea level change; sediment trapping; sand mining; salinity intrusion; coastal restoration; estuarine engineering; shoreline evolution; estuarine processes; and the names of specific river basin deltas. Review Results/Synthesis and Discussion. Deltas provide humans important resources and ecosystem services leading to their intensive development. The impacts of this development, together with sea-level rise, threatens the sustainability of many river deltas. Various management and governance measures are available to help sustain deltas. Controls on land use, improved farming and transport technology, wetland habitat protection, and d improved governance are some that might help sustain the economic and ecological services provided by deltas. However, increased population growth and the impacts of climate change will put increased pressure on deltas and the benefits derived from them. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study uses computational tools to examine how two major consequences of sea level rise: salt intrusion and an increase in water volume affect the hydrodynamics and flooding areas of a major estuary in the Iberian Peninsula. A 2D numerical model created with the software MOHID was used to simulate the Guadiana Estuary in different scenarios of sea level rise combined with different freshwater flow rates considering varying tidal amplitudes. An increase in salinity was found in response to an increase in mean sea level in both high and low freshwater flow rates at all areas around the estuary. An increase in flooding areas around the estuary was also positively correlated with an increase in mean sea level. © 2020 The Authors,2020,,J. Comput.

442,Tidal river dynamics: Implications for deltas,"Hoitink, A.J.F.; Jay, D.A.","Tidal rivers are a vital and little studied nexus between physical oceanography and hydrology. It is only in the last few decades that substantial research efforts have been focused on the interactions of river discharge with tidal waves and storm surges into regions beyond the limit of salinity intrusion, a realm that can extend inland hundreds of kilometers. One key phenomenon resulting from this interaction is the emergence of large fortnightly tides, which are forced long waves with amplitudes that may increase beyond the point where astronomical tides have become extinct. These can be larger than the linear tide itself at more landward locations, and they greatly influence tidal river water levels and wetland inundation. Exploration of the spectral redistribution and attenuation of tidal energy in rivers has led to new appreciation of a wide range of consequences for fluvial and coastal sedimentology, delta evolution, wetland conservation, and salinity intrusion under the influence of sea level rise and delta subsidence. Modern research aims at unifying traditional harmonic tidal analysis, nonparametric regression techniques, and the existing understanding of tidal hydrodynamics to better predict and model tidal river dynamics both in single-thread channels and in branching channel networks. In this context, this review summarizes results from field observations and modeling studies set in tidal river environments as diverse as the Amazon in Brazil, the Columbia, Fraser and Saint Lawrence in North America, the Yangtze and Pearl in China, and the Berau and Mahakam in Indonesia. A description of state-of-the-art methods for a comprehensive analysis of water levels, wave propagation, discharges, and inundation extent in tidal rivers is provided. Implications for lowland river deltas are also discussed in terms of sedimentary deposits, channel bifurcation, avulsion, and salinity intrusion, addressing contemporary research challenges. ©2016.

443,Critical review of salinity intrusion in rivers and estuaries,"Mohammed, R.; Scholz, M.","There is scientific evidence of accelerated sea level rise and saline intrusion. Some impacts, such as stratification and estuarine circulation, are subtle; others are dramatic including shifts in salt-sensitive habitats and limited water availability of suitable quality for industrial and municipal uses. These results have become a remarkable reality resulting in a set of integrated surface water organisation issues. Tremendous population increases overwhelming many coastal areas have expanded the problem. These challenges have been studied from many perspectives using various objectives and methodologies, and then arriving at different findings. However, all research assured that significant rises in sea level have influenced estuaries and tidally affected rivers, and these observations are expected to become rapidly worse in the future. This study introduces, categorises, critically investigates, and synthesises the most related studies regarding accelerated sea level rise and challenges of the development associated with the resources of surface water in estuaries and tidally-affected rivers. This critical review reveals that there is a need for research that focuses on the development of sustainable surface water resources. © IWA Publishing 2018.",2018,,J. Water Clim.

451,Investigating impacts of Climate Change on the Weser estuary,"Zorndt, A.C.; Schlurmann, T.","According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global climate change will have profound impact on our environment. This applies to estuaries in particular, as they are not only influenced by changes in the meteorological conditions, but also by the mean sea level rise, changes in river runoff regimes and possibly more intense storm surges. As this makes impact studies in estuaries rely on impact studies of neighboring systems such as watersheds or adjacent shelf seas, uncertainties may accumulate. This complicates to derive reliable projections for planners and decision makers. This contribution describes a work package of a joint climate impact project of the German state Lower Saxony. The aim of the project is to investigate impacts on hydrodynamics and salinities of the Weser estuary. The impact model used in the study is a 3D hydrodynamic modelling tool.

454,Ecosystem attributes related to tidal wetland effects on water quality,"Findlay, S.; Fischer, D.","Biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems is central to nutrient cycling, carbon balance, and several ecosystem services, yet it is not always clear why levels of function might vary among systems. Wetlands are widely recognized for their ability to alter concentrations of solutes and particles as water moves through them, but we have only general expectations for what attributes of wetlands are linked to variability in these processes. We examined changes in several water quality variables (dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and suspended particles) to ascertain which constituents are influenced during tidal exchange with a range of 17 tidal freshwater wetlands along the Hudson River, New York, USA. Many of the constituents showed significant differences among wetlands or between flooding and ebbing tidal concentrations, indicating wetland-mediated effects. For dissolved oxygen, the presence of even small proportional cover by submerged aquatic vegetation increased the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water returned to the main channel following a daytime tidal exchange. Nitrate concentrations showed consistent declines during ebbing tides, but the magnitude of decline varied greatly among sites. The proportional cover by graminoiddominated high intertidal vegetation accounted for over 40% of the variation in nitrate decline. Knowing which water-quality alterations are associated with which attributes helps suggest underlying mechanisms and identifies what functions might be susceptible to change as sea level rise or salinity intrusion drives shifts in wetland vegetation cover. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",2013,,Ecology,94,1,117-125,,10.1890/12-0464.1,,#15771,Findlay 2013,,
458,Sensitivity of Salinity Intrusion to Sea Level Rise and River Flow Change in Vietnamese Mekong Delta-Impacts on Availability of Irrigation Water for Rice Cropping,"Kotera, A.; Sakamoto, T.; Yokozawa, M.; Khang, N.D.","The combined impact of sea level rise and reduction of the Mekong River flow in the dry season on salinity intrusion and rice cropping in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta was assessed in this study. The MIKE11 model was used to simulate flow and salinity intrusion from December to June for the medium-term (mid-2030s) and long-term (mid-2090s) scenarios using data derived from the SRES B2 climate change projection. The sea level rise values for two scenarios were +20 cm and +45 cm, while the rates of change for the Mekong River flow were -15% and -29%, respectively. The results obtained for the mid-2030s and mid-2090s scenarios show that the 2.5 g/L saline front is likely to shift upstream by 10 km and 20 km in the main river channels, and up to 20 km and 35 km in the paddy field, respectively. The simulated salinity intrusion results were then used to compute durations of available water for irrigating rice cropping. The results indicate that area where triple rice crops are possible, will be reduced by approximately 71,000 and 72,000 ha, while single crop areas will be increased by approximately 38,000 and 179,000 ha for the mid-2030s and mid-2090s scenarios, respectively. Using GIS techniques the delta was divided into three areas reflecting different rice crop vulnerability levels; areas of high and medium vulnerability measured approximately 200,000 ha and 400,000 ha, respectively. © 2008, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

The construction of embankments and dykes has historically been the principal strategy of the Vietnamese government to mitigate the effects of salinity intrusion on agricultural production. A predicted sea-level rise of 30 cm by the year 2050 is expected to accelerate salinity intrusion. This study combines hydrologic, agronomic and behavioural assessments to identify effective adaptation strategies reliant on land-use change (soft options) and investments in water infrastructure (hard options). As these strategies are managed within different policy portfolios, the political discussion has polarized between choices of either soft or hard options. This paper argues that an ensemble of hard and soft policies is likely to provide the most effective results for people's livelihoods in the Mekong Delta. The consequences of policy deliberations are likely to be felt beyond the Mekong Delta as levels of rice cultivation there also affect national and global food security. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

462,The impacts of sea level rise on the Nigerian coast,"Nwilo, P.C.","The Nigerian coastal areas are generally low-lying and flat. A small rise in sea level will, therefore, have far-reaching consequences. The results of studies on the Niger Delta indicate that the sea level is rising at an annual rate of 1 mm. This does not take account of the subsidence which is believed to be taking place on the Nigerian coast. The impacts of the rise in sea level along the Nigerian coast include: destruction of forests, changes in types of crops, salinity intrusion into sources of fresh water, more frequent storm surges, flooding and inundation, increased coastal erosion, and destruction of coastal infrastructure and fish spawning grounds. To minimise the impacts of sea level rise on the Nigerian coast, there is a need to collate and analyse various forms of environment-related data such as tides, waves, salinity, remote sensing and erosion. In addition, a Coastal Management Commission should be set up to design and implement policies aimed at the sustainable management of the Nigerian coastal areas.",2000,,Environ. Educ.

463,Implications of global climatic change and energy cost and availability for the restoration of the Mississippi delta,"Day Jr., J.W.; Barras, J.; Clairain, E.; Johnston, J.; Justic, D.; Kemp, G.P.; Ko, J.-Y.; Lane, R.; Mitsch, W.J.; Steyer, G.; Templet, P.; Yañez-Arancibia, A.","Over the past several thousand years, inputs from the Mississippi River formed the Mississippi delta, an area of about 25,000 km2. Over the past century, however, there has been a high loss of coastal wetlands of about 4800 km2. The main causes of this loss are the near complete isolation of the river from the delta, mostly due to the construction of flood control levees, and pervasive hydrological disruption of the deltaic plain. There is presently a large-scale State-Federal program to restore the delta that includes construction of water control structures in the flood control levees to divert river water into deteriorating wetlands and pumping of dredged sediment, often for long distances, for marsh creation. Global climate change and decreasing availability and increasing cost of energy are likely to have important implications for delta restoration. Coastal restoration efforts will have to be more intensive to offset the impacts of climate change including accelerated sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns. Future coastal restoration efforts should also focus on less energy-intensive, ecologically engineered management techniques that use the energies of nature as much as possible. Diversions may be as important for controlling salinity as for providing sediments and nutrients for restoring coastal wetlands. Energy-intensive pumping-dredged sediments for coastal restoration will likely become much more expensive in the future. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2005,,Ecol. Eng.,24,4 SPEC.

465,Variations in water resources in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in response to climate change and their impacts on rice production,"Khang, N.D.; Kotera, A.; Iizumi, T.; Sakamoto, T.; Yokozawa, M.","A numerical hydraulic model was developed and used to investigate the spread of salinity intrusion and the propagation of flooding in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta under two proposed scenarios: ""baseline"" (2000s) and ""future"" (2090s). The baseline scenario was based on observed hydrological and salinity intrusion data from 1998 to 2006. The changes in upstream flow discharge in the future scenario (increased for most of the year) were derived from previous research results obtained using the Japan Meteorological Agency atmospheric general circulation model output for the IPCC SRES A1B scenario. The sea level rise in the A1B scenario (a projected 53-cm increase) was also included in the future scenario. The resulting salinity intrusion and flood water levels were then used to roughly estimate possible rice cropping durations. We found that large adverse changes in duration of rice cultivation in the future scenario were caused mainly by floods with greater peaks, larger areal extents, and longer durations. The area potentially suitable for growing triple rice crops decreased from 31% of the total delta area currently to 5%, whereas that potentially suitable for a single rice crop increased from 21% currently to 62%. Using GIS techniques, we divided the delta into three areas with different levels of rice vulnerability levels. Areas of high and medium vulnerability covered approximately 31 and 36% of the total delta area, respectively. © 2010, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan. All rights reserved.",2010,,J.

468,Estuarine response to river flow and sea-level rise under future climate change and human development,"Yang, Z.; Wang, T.; Voisin, N.; Copping, A.","Understanding the response of river flow and estuarine hydrodynamics to climate change, land-use/land-cover change (LULC), and sea-level rise is essential to managing water resources and stress on living organisms under these changing conditions. This paper presents a modeling study using a watershed hydrology model and an estuarine hydrodynamic model, in a one-way coupling, to investigate the estuarine hydrodynamic response to sea-level rise and change in river flow due to the effect of future climate and LULC changes in the Snohomish River estuary, Washington, USA. A set of hydrodynamic variables, including salinity intrusion points, average water depth, and salinity of the inundated area, were used to quantify the estuarine response to river flow and sea-level rise. Model results suggest that salinity intrusion points in the Snohomish River estuary and the average salinity of the inundated areas are a nonlinear function of river flow, although the average water depth in the inundated area is approximately linear with river flow. Future climate changes will shift salinity intrusion points further upstream under low flow conditions and further downstream under high flow conditions. In contrast, under the future LULC change scenario, the salinity intrusion point will shift downstream under both low and high flow conditions, compared to present conditions. The model results also suggest that the average water depth in the inundated areas increases linearly with sea-level rise but at a slower rate, and the average salinity in the inundated areas increases linearly with sea-level rise; however, the response of salinity intrusion points in the river to sea-level rise is strongly nonlinear. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,,Estuar.

During a drought a significant amount of saline estuary water can recharge certain aquifer systems. The objective of this study is to consider various response options that are appropriate to minimize the impact of the salinity intrusion into the Delaware Estuary and adjacent Potomac-Raritan-Magothy aquifer system (PRM) during a drought. Extraction wells and a combination of extraction and injection wells are considered during the drought period.

473,Study of salt transport processes in Delaware Bay,"Walters, Roy","The study described here is a subset of a broader climate-related study, and is focused primarily on salinity intrusion into Delaware Bay and River. Given changes in freshwater discharge into the Delaware River as determined from the larger study, and given probable sea level rise estimates, the purpose here is to calculate the distribution of salinity within Delaware Bay and River. The approach adopted for this study is composed of two parts: an analysis of existing physical data in order to derive a basic understanding of the salt dynamics, and numerical simulation of future conditions based on this analysis. There are two important constraints in the model used: it must resolve the spatial scales important to the salt dynamics, and it must be sufficiently efficient to allow extensive sensitivity studies. This has led to the development of a 3D model that uses harmonic decomposition in time and irregular finite elements in space. All nonlinear terms are retained in the governing equations, including quadratic bottom stress, advection, and wave transport (continuity nonlinearity). These equations are coupled to the advection-diffusion equation for salt so that density gradient forcing is included in the momentum equations. Although this study is still in progress, the model has reproduced sea level variations and the 3D structure of tidal and residual currents very well. In addition, the study has addressed the effects of a 1-meter rise in mean sea level on hydrodynamics of the study area. Current work is focused on salt dynamics.",1992,,,,,240-251,,,,#15800,Walters 1992,,

This paper is primarily based on a study conducted to explore gender vulnerability at the community level due to water-related natural hazards (flood, drought and salinity intrusion) and possible coping mechanisms. Both secondary and primary data have been used and analysed to identify vulnerability. The study indicates that the extreme events (e.g. flood, drought and salinity intrusion) have adverse impacts which are different for different population groups. In reality, women are affected more severely: their role is quite negligible in decision making, and participation in training related to climate change issues are also insignificant.

481,Forecasting future paddy production in the Mekong Delta,"Boretti, A.","The Mekong Delta is an area of intense paddy production subjected to important environmental and societal changes. The manuscript reviews the environmental forces (subsidence, sea-level rise, freshwater availability, salinization), the societal changes (amount and quality of agricultural products, uses of land, uses of fresh water, agricultural regulations, incentives to industry and agriculture, population, and economic growth), and the technological advances (types of crops, agricultural practices) which may affect the production of paddy in the Mekong Delta. Forecasting based on the past data of paddy production is finally used to compute the paddy production by 2030. The relevant environmental, societal, and technological changes are impossible to be fully factored into a forecasting technique that is only based on the analysis of past outputs as the one proposed in the work, which only partially evidences the influence of these drivers in the measure they have acted especially in more recent years. The work forecasts a stable paddy production of 25,000 thousand tons, thanks to a growth in the yield from 60 to 65 quintal/ha, which compensates for a loss of land for this cultivation of the same relative percentage amount.

In estuarine areas, these factors are coalescing to increase saline contamination. Between 2006 and 2007, coastal Bangladesh experienced a sudden and dramatic increase in water salinity, with the saline front shifting inland by roughly 20km. We use this exceptional event to explore the impact of salinity on economic activity and agricultural production. Our results indicate that locations that experienced a sudden increase in water salinity incurred a 33% reduction in economic activity, as measured by nightlight intensity. This coincides with a decline in the cultivation of high-yielding rice varieties, which are not salt tolerant, as well as the removal of land from production. There is no robust evidence that changes in population drove these losses in economic activity. While sea level rise may be only one factor in this shift of the salinity front, our findings suggest that the future impacts of sea level rise have the potential to be quite large and may not be limited to coastline locations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2022,,Popul.

Despite evidence showing that microbial metabolism can determine the fate of soil C decomposition, the response of microbial metabolism to salinization in tidal wetlands remains largely unknown. Microbial metabolism is impacted by the microbial metabolic limitation and carbon use efficiency (CUE), which can provide mechanistic insights into soil C decomposition. Here, we measured microbial metabolic limitation, microbial CUE, and extracellular enzyme activities along an estuarine salinity gradient ranging from freshwater (0.1 ± 0.1 mg g−1) to oligohaline (2.1 ± 0.5 mg g−1) in a tidal wetland. Overall, microorganisms were limited by phosphorus (P) in the tidal wetlands, where salinization increased microbial P limitation by 34%. The enhanced microbial P limitation was attributed to increases in soil C:P and belowground biomass, as well as decreases in root C:P with increasing salinity. Microbial CUE decreased from 0.38 to 0.33 as salinity increased, while microbial P limitation was negatively correlated with microbial CUE, representing the trade-off between the two. Furthermore, microbial P limitation was positively associated with C-, nitrogen (N)-, and P-acquiring extracellular enzyme activities, while all these enzyme activities were negatively correlated with microbial CUE. These results illustrate that to balance microbial P limitation with salinization, microorganisms transfer more energy from the microbial CUE to extracellular enzyme production, and this was the mechanism underlying the trade-off. Microorganisms were also limited by C in the tidal wetlands. However, as the increasing belowground biomass alleviated microbial C limitation with salinization, no relationship was observed between microbial C limitation and CUE. Future C and nutrient models aimed to simulate tidal wetland ecosystem responses to salinization will benefit from the inclusion of trade-off between microbial CUE and microbial P limitation for more accurate prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Catena,209,,,,10.1016/j.catena.2021.105809,,#15841,Zhai 2022,,

However, the response of soil microbes to increasing salinity conditions within coastal environments is poorly understood, despite their importance for nutrient cascading, carbon sequestration and wider ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate deterioration in the productivity of a top-tier microbial group (testate amoebae) with increasing coastal salinity, which we show to be consistent across phylogenetic groups, salinity gradients, environment types and latitude. Our results show that microbial changes occur in the very early stages of marine inundation, presaging more radical changes in soil and ecosystem function and providing an early warning of coastal salinisation that could be used to improve coastal planning and adaptation. © 2021 The Authors.

To determine especially the impact of salinity pulses that occur during flooding events, Typha latifolia, Carex acutiformis, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Phragmites australis were exposed to different salinity regimes consisting of control (permanently freshwater and permanently brackish water) and alternating freshwater and brackish water with different exposure durations (2 days brackish – 2 days fresh; 4 days brackish – 4 days fresh; 2 days brackish – 4 days fresh). Plant height, leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence, root:shoot ratio and photosynthetic pigments were measured. Salinity suppressed the growth of T. latifolia resulting in shorter height, smaller mean leaf area and higher root:shoot ratio. Carex acutiformis had smaller mean leaf area and higher root:shoot ratio. Photosynthetic pigment and chlorophyll fluorescence of both species were not affected. Shorter but frequent salinity pulses (alternate 2 days brackish – 2 days freshwater, and 2 days brackish – 4 days freshwater) decreased the leaf area of T. latifolia while C. acutiformis was not affected. Salinity and salinity pulses did not affect the height and root:shoot ratio of P. australis and S. tabernaemontani. Phragmites australis showed signs of successful acclimation through decreased chlorophyll a:carotenoid ratio and high fluorescence Δyield at low and high irradiance. Our results imply that with increasing seawater influx into coastal peatlands, T. latifolia and C. acutiformis may experience growth retardation or may even be replaced by S. tabernaemontani or P. australis since they are more resilient against salinity and frequent salinity pulses. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Wetlands,42,7,,,10.1007/s13157-022-01592-0,,#15847,Batistel 2022,,

Modelling analysis using MANTRA was performed to examine the sustainability of coastal groundwater and vegetation in Pantai Acheh in response to SLR. MANTRA was developed by linking two United States Geological Survey (USGS) simulation models known as MANHAM and SUTRA. Simulation analysis revealed that Penang Island does not have viable fresh groundwater. Further, a projected 1-m SLR may lead to a 22% loss in mangrove coverage within the study site, adversely impacting SDG2 and SDG6. Penang’s current water management practices are not sustainable to meet growing demand for freshwater and to overcome the impacts of global climate change (GCC). Hence, alternative water supply options such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater exploitation and consumer education deserve careful consideration and research to ensure a sustainable water future for Penang Island towards achieving SDG6 and SDG2. Key elements for achieving these two SDGs include adapting integrated coastal zone management and integrated water management to mitigate increased risk of floods and droughts due to GCC and SLR, and protecting mangrove forests and their ecosystem services from further degradation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",2021,,J.

Peri-urban areas—which are typically under-governed, undergoing significant environmental change and highly susceptible to zoonotic disease transfer–are especially important in this regard. In this research note, we briefly explore how climate change is contributing to both peri-urbanization and EID risk. First, climate change is linked to the displacement of people and other species into peri-urban areas, thereby increasing opportunities for zoonotic disease transfer. Second, whether coastal or inland, peri-urban space, characterized by low resources and inadequate services, is also typically vulnerable to mounting climate impacts including severe weather events, sea level rise, flooding, erosion, drought, salinization and heat waves that create socio-ecological conditions amenable to EID outbreaks. These relationships are particularly alarming given that peri-urban environments abut urban areas creating numerous pathways for the movement of EIDs into larger populations. In this research note, we briefly explore these relationships and illustrate them with a causal loop diagram of climate change-peri-urban displacement-EID interactions based on field work in Malawi. We conclude by emphasizing the need for improved EID risk management and suggest that bringing together the environmental expertise of the conservation community with that of planners through a more convivial urbanism that draws on the concept of working landscape conservation might be a beneficial approach. © 2021 The Authors",2022,,Landsc.

503,Distance to coastline modulates morphology and population structure in a coastal amphibian,"Lorrain-Soligon, L.; Robin, F.; Lelong, V.; Jankovic, M.; Barbraud, C.; Brischoux, F.","Salinization due to sea-level rise and marine submersions is expected to strongly impact coastal ecosystems. Exposure to salinity can negatively impact biodiversity especially in coastal wetlands. To understand comprehensively the consequences of environmental salinization on coastal biodiversity, it is essential to document how coastal species currently respond to exposure to salinity. In this study, we investigated how variations of environmental salinity relative to the distance to the ocean influence population structure (age ratio and sex ratio), and individual hydro-mineral balance (osmolality) and morphology (size, mass, condition) in the western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) in two populations from the French Atlantic coast. We show that distance to coastline strongly influences exposure to salt on a small spatial scale. Some variables (e.g., abundances, osmolality, morphology) responded similarly in both sites and may be related to salt deposition due to landward sea-spray. Interestingly, other variables (sex ratio and age ratio) displayed site-specific responses and appeared to be linked to the salinity of breeding sites. Distance to the shoreline appears to be a critical population structuring factor in this coastal salt-tolerant species. Future studies should investigate how distance to shoreline- A nd thus environmental salinity-can ultimately affect individual performances and fitness.  © 2022 The Author(s).

But the current system of global governance is entirely insufficient to cope with, let alone effectively respond to, the looming crisis of climate displacement. This policy brief discusses the current state of the global governance of climate displacement and identifies a number of substantive and organizational legal and policy elements in need of rapid implementation and development.

506,"The late Pleistocene-Holocene changing morphology of the Volturno delta and coast (northern Campania, Italy): Geological architecture and human influence","Ruberti, D.; Buffardi, C.; Sacchi, M.; Vigliotti, M.","The present geomorphology of the Volturno River delta system and related strandplain is largely a product of complex, long-lived relationships between geological evolution and human impacts. In order to assess the main drivers of the changed landscape in the last centuries, a multidisciplinary study was carried out by combining geological and historical data. The study was based on geological and geophysical data, including about 1800 stratigraphic well logs to reconstruct the stratigraphic architecture of the delta plain and ca. 180 km of very high resolution single channel reflection profiles to image the stratigraphic pattern of the continental shelf and the offshore delta. Cartographic sources from the last 150 years were acquired, georeferenced and managed into a GIS environment, to support geomorphological interpretation. Land use maps were reconstructed for the 1957, 1990 and 2012. The Late Pleistocene and Holocene reconstruction of the Volturno coastal plain evolution evidenced the control of climatic changes (and consequently sediment supply and global eustatic variations) on the depositional history. The present landscape appears largely inherited by the past MIS5 and LGM landscapes. A progressive increment of anthropic forcing took place in the last 2000 years but the strongest modifications of the landscape occurred since the end of the XVII century, when, during the Spanish vice-kingdom, it was subjected to major land reclamation. More than 500 km of canals were built in the coastal area and resulted in the development of agriculture and farming on reclaimed land, promoting urbanization and increasing landscape fragmentation. A peak of major alterations of the deltaic environment, and retreat of the coastline was attained between the 1960s and the 1990s. Severe urbanization along the coastline, coupled with intensification of agricultural and tourism activities, resulted in a significant loss of natural ecosystems including humid coastal areas, lacustrine/marshy back-dune areas and mostly the beach-dune system. The negative sedimentary balance resulting from the reclamation works on the river courses, along with the interventions along the Volturno river basin, resulted in an accelerated and severe coastal erosion. The latter, coupled with subsidence rates and sea level rise, increase the vulnerability of the coast to flooding and storm surge and aquifer salinization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA",2022,,Quat.

511,Intangible cultural heritage: a benefit to climate-displaced and host communities,"Aktürk, G.; Lerski, M.","Climate change is borderless, and its impacts are not shared equally by all communities. It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives.

513,Asymmetric root distributions reveal press–pulse responses in retreating coastal forests,"Messerschmidt, T.C.; Langston, A.K.; Kirwan, M.L.","The impacts of climate change on ecosystems are manifested in how organisms respond to episodic and continuous stressors. The conversion of coastal forests to salt marshes represents a prominent example of ecosystem state change, driven by the continuous stress of sea-level rise (press), and episodic storms (pulse). Here, we measured the rooting dimension and fall direction of 143 windthrown eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) trees in a rapidly retreating coastal forest in Chesapeake Bay (USA). We found that tree roots were distributed asymmetrically away from the leading edge of soil salinization and towards freshwater sources. The length, number, and circumference of roots were consistently higher in the upslope direction than downslope direction, suggesting an active morphological adaptation to sea-level rise and salinity stress. Windthrown trees consistently fell in the upslope direction regardless of aspect and prevailing wind direction, suggesting that asymmetric rooting destabilized standing trees, and reduced their ability to withstand high winds. Together, these observations help explain curious observations of coastal forest resilience, and highlight an interesting nonadditive response to climate change, where adaptation to press stressors increases vulnerability to pulse stressors. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America",2021,,Ecology,102,10,,,10.1002/ecy.3468,,#15867,Messerschmidt 2021,,
518,Salinity exerted little effect on decomposition of emergent macrophytes in coastal peatlands,"Batistel, C.C.; Jurasinski, G.; Schubert, H.","Climate-warming-driven sea level rise may change the vegetation composition of coastal wetlands, influencing ecosystem functions including photosynthetic activity, biomass production, litter decomposability and nutrient cycling. Litter decomposition rates of the most dominant macrophytes, Phragmites australis, Carex sp. and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, in two nearby freshwater and oligohaline peatlands were compared to determine the impact of salinity on litter decomposition. Electrical conductivity difference of 1.2–8.0 mS cm-1 (mean difference = 4.8 mS cm-1) between freshwater and oligohaline peatlands did not significantly affect the decomposition of macrophyte litter. Between species, S. tabernaemontani lost a significantly higher mass (29%) in the first month of decomposition compared to P. australis and Carex sp. Overall, litter decay rates for S. tabernaemontani was k = 0.0064–0.0078 d-1 while P. australis and Carex sp. both had k = 0.0017–0.0028 d-1. After one year, S. tabernaemontani litter was totally decomposed while the other species had 40–60% mass remaining relative to their initial dry mass confirming that P. australis and Carex sp. contribute to peat formation while S. tabernaemontani does not. Apparent differences in decomposition kinetics between S. tabernaemontani and the other species tested indicated that litter quality, especially C:P, C:N, N:P and C:Ca, is of great importance for both microbial colonization (initial phase) as well as for sustaining decomposition after colonization. This study shows that litter quality controls litter decomposition more than narrow salinity ranges. Hence, we suggest that sea level rise, combined with increased precipitation, may not have significant impact on the decomposition of these macrophytes in the future. However, sea level rise may lead to changes in vegetation composition replacing the peat-forming species by S. tabernaemontani which favors relatively deep, oligohaline wetlands. This would eventually affect carbon sequestration rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,Aquatic Bot.,175,,,,10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103446,,#15873,Batistel 2021,,
519,Iron-bound carbon increases along a freshwater−oligohaline gradient in a subtropical tidal wetland,"Bai, J.; Luo, M.; Yang, Y.; Xiao, S.; Zhai, Z.; Huang, J.","Globally, a vast extent of tidal wetlands will be threatened by sea-level-rise-induced salinization. Because ferric (hydro)oxides [Fe(III)] play a crucial role in soil organic carbon (SOC) preservation, understanding the responses of the Fe-bound C pool to increasing salinity could assist in accurate prediction of the changes in C stocks in the tidal wetland soils facing imminent sea-level rise. In this study, we investigated pools of Fe-bound C and SOC, C-degrading enzyme activity, Fe species contents and Fe-cycling bacteria, and plant properties along a salinity gradient from freshwater (0.0 ± 0.1 ppt; part per thousand) to oligohaline (2.6 ± 0.6 ppt) in a subtropical tidal wetland. Overall, the belowground biomass and the content of root Fe(III) plaque (a proxy of root oxygen loss potential) rose with the increasing salinity. Along the salinity gradient, the abundance of Gallionella (Fe-oxidizing bacteria) increased, but the abundance of Geobacter (Fe-reducing bacteria) decreased. The Fe(II):Fe(III) ratios decreased as salinity increased, implying that more Fe(II) was oxidized and immobilized into Fe(III) closer to the sea. Fe sulfides contents also elevated close to sea. The co-existence of Fe(III) and Fe sulfides at the oligohaline sites implied a high spatial heterogeneity of Fe distribution. During the growing season, the SOC pool generally decreased with increasing salinity, probably due to a reduction in aboveground-C input and enhanced activity of the C-degrading enzyme. The Fe-bound C pool was positively affected by the amorphous Fe(III) content and negatively related to the activity of phenol oxidase. The Fe-bound C pool generally rose along the salinity gradient, with the importance of Fe-bound C to SOC increasing from 18% to 29%. Altogether, our findings implied that when the imminent sea-level-rise-induced salinization occurs, the total soil C stock may generally decrease, but Fe-bound C will become increasingly important in protecting the rest of the C stocks in tidal wetland soils. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Soil Biol.

As nitrogen (N) availability is closely related to the structure and function of ecosystems, it is crucial to understand how seawater intrusion impacts biological N2 fixation, a major pathway of new N input to natural ecosystems. Here, a seawater addition experiment with two N2-fixing plant species (Acacia auriculiformis and Casuarina equisetifolia) and 10 non-N2-fixing plant species was conducted to simulate sea level rise-associated seawater intrusion. The experiment included control (0 mm seawater/year), low seawater addition (LSW, 200 mm seawater/year) and high seawater addition (HSW, 400 mm seawater/year). Symbiotic N2 fixation (SNF) rate of A. auriculiformis was significantly higher under LSW (but not for HSW) than the control. For C. equisetifolia, SNF rates under LSW and HSW significantly increased by 8.0 and 19.5 times, respectively, compared with the control. In contrast, asymbiotic N2 fixation rates under LSW and HSW significantly decreased by 18.5% and 30.4%, respectively, across all the plant species. Our findings suggest that the responses of biological N2 fixation to seawater intrusion are divergent either among different N2-fixing plant species or between symbiotic and asymbiotic forms, which should be considered in terrestrial ecosystem models in order to improve the prediction of N dynamics under climate changes.

522,Coastal subsidence detection and characterization caused by brine mining over the Yellow River Delta using time series InSAR and PCA,"Wang, G.; Li, P.; Li, Z.; Liang, C.; Wang, H.","Extensive coastal deltas in the world are subsiding due to natural or anthropogenic activities. As the widest and youngest river delta in the world, serious coastal subsidence in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) has exacerbated the relative sea level rise (RSLR) and increased the risk of soil salinization and coastal flooding. However, there are rarely relevant studies that quantitatively separate the contributions from different driving factors to subsidence. In this work, we aim to provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of coastal subsidence related to coastal brine pumping activities in YRD. We investigate the land deformation of the entire YRD by time series InSAR analysis (TS-InSAR) of Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2016 and 2021. The results reveal that fast subsiding funnels larger than 50 mm/yr are mainly distributed in the coastal brine mining clusters. We further used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the principal components and temporal patterns from the deformation time series. Taking geological data, precipitation, temperature, and human activities into consideration, we quantitatively separate the driving factors of coastal subsidence in sub-areas. We find that underground brine mining contributes to more than 94 % of the coastal subsidence of the YRD. In addition, precipitation is the most important natural factor that can affect the process of land subsidence in YRD, whereas other driving factors from soil consolidation, oil extraction and other activities are not noticeable. This study is expected to offer a cost-effective method for detecting and characterizing coastal subsidence in global sinking deltas, which will contribute to more accurate dynamic monitoring of coastal subsidence and a better understanding of land subsidence responses to anthropogenic activities. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Int.

525,Coastal Groundwater Flow at the Nearshore and Embayment Scales: A Field and Modeling Study,"Evans, T.B.; White, S.M.; Wilson, A.M.","Knowledge of coastal groundwater flow is critical for managing coastal groundwater resources and quantifying submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), but this flow occurs over multiple scales that can be difficult to study in an integrated way. We designed a field and modeling study to investigate groundwater flow and the distribution of salinity during sea level rise in a domain that included beaches, salt marshes and the first major confined aquifer, which reached 10–15 km offshore. Numerical models were based on the flat-lying, passive margin coastline of North Inlet, SC, and were constrained by field studies including subsurface resistivity surveys and hydraulic head observations. Simulations that included tidal fluctuations showed that the salt marsh generated more than three times as much SGD as the beach and inner shelf, per unit length of coastline. Groundwater exchange between scales was small, suggesting that physical fluxes of groundwater can be considered independently at different scales. However, salinization of the first major confined aquifer occurred by downward transport from overlying aquifers rather than intrusion from the seaward end, suggesting that studies of aquifer salinization should consider multiscale flow. During simulated sea level rise, fresh-to-brackish groundwater persisted in the first confined aquifer as far as the seaward end of the overlying confining unit, 10–20 km offshore. Total fluxes of SGD decreased significantly with future sea level rise, dominated by declining SGD in the salt marsh, and portending a marked decline in the flux of nutrients and carbon to estuaries and the coastal ocean. ©2020.

Invasive species can often outcompete native species, but few studies focus on whether invasive alien species are always superior competitors under increasing stressors. We grew an invasive grass species, Oenothera biennis L., and three native grass species (Artemisia argyi Lévl. et Vant., Chenopodium album L., and Inula japonica Thunb.) as a monoculture (two seedlings of each species) or mixture (one seedling of O. biennis and one native species seedling) under three levels of salt treatments (0, 1, and 2 g/kg NaCl) in a greenhouse. We found that invasive O. biennis exhibited greater performance over native C. album and I. japonica, but lower performance compared to A. argyi, regardless of the soil salinity. However, salinity did not significantly affect the relative dominance of O. biennis. Interspecific competition enhanced the growth of O. biennis and inhibited the growth of I. japonica. Although O. biennis seedlings always had growth dominance over C. album seedlings, C. album was not affected by O. biennis at any salt level. At high salt levels, O. biennis inhibited the growth of A. argyi, while A. argyi did not affect the growth of O. biennis. Salt alleviated the competitive effect of O. biennis on I. japonica but did not mitigate the competition between O. biennis and the other two native species. Therefore, our study provides evidence for a better understanding of the invasive mechanisms of alien species under various salinity conditions.

Costa, D.; Cavalcanti, L.F.","Coastal environments are at the frontline of sea-level rise effects, and seawater intrusion constitutes one of the most important causes of salinization, changing the ecological patterns. Hence, we hypothesized that seawater intrusion would alter environmental gradients, causing either abrupt or gradual changes in the phytoplankton of Itapecuru River estuary. Physical and chemical and biological variables were collected bimonthly at six sites between 2019 and 2020. Seventy-six phytoplankton indicators were selected based on their specific functional traits and indicator value. Polymyxus coronalis was a good indicator of the limit of seawater intrusion. Multivariate analyses revealed high species dispersion among the estuarine sectors governed by variations in salinity, suspended particulate matter, cell size, and silicate. The distribution of freshwater species in the upper sector was correlated with low nutrient values and salinity. The marine species were transported between the middle and lower sectors under the opposite conditions. The seawater intrusion negatively affected the community, primarily in the dry season when the displacement of the turbidity maximum zone estuarine altered the structure, reducing its density, diversity, and biomass. The present study generated important information about seawater intrusion effects on the spatiotemporal variation in the phytoplankton community and provided a tool for the sustainable management of tropical estuaries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Hydrobiologia,,,,,10.1007/s10750-022-04851-7,,#15883,Sá 2022,,

SOUTHERN DOBROGEA COASTAL POTABLE WATER SOURCES AND UPPER QUATERNARY BLACK SEA LEVEL CHANGES,"Caraivan, G.; Vasiliu, D.-L.; Bujini, J.; Ispas, B.-A.","The coastal area is the field of continuous interaction of marine hydrodynamic factors with those that act on the land. Since the prehistory, human communities have settled in this area, having access to both marine and land resources, drinking water being the most important. The Black Sea level is the drainage base level to which the surface waters of its hydrographic basin flow, but it also influences the groundwater dynamics. Southern Dobrogea is a typical geologic platform unit, divided in several tectonic blocks by a regional WNW - ESE and NNE - SSW fault system. Four drinking water sources have been identified: surface water, phreatic water, medium depth Sarmatian aquifer, and deep Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous aquifer. Surface water sources are represented by several springs emerged from the base of the loess cliff, and a few small rivers, barred by coastal beaches. The cyclic Upper Quaternary climate changes induced drastic remodeling of the Black Sea level and the corresponding shorelines. During the Last Glacial Maximum (MIS 2), the shoreline retreats eastwards, reaching the 100-120 m isobaths. In these conditions, the surface drainage base level was very low. The Holocene Transgression (MIS 1) determined a sea level rise up to the modern one. During the Greek colonization, the rising sea level caused the salinization of the previous drinking water phreatic sources. In these conditions, in the Roman Age, a new hydraulic infrastructure had to be developed, using aqueducts for available inland water delivery. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

In such regions, groundwater tables are steadily declining with major consequences for groundwater-surface water interactions. Predominantly gaining streams that rely on discharge of groundwater from the adjacent aquifer turn into predominantly losing streams whose water seeps into the underground. This reversal of groundwater-surface water interactions is associated with an increase of low river flows, drying of stream beds, and a switch of lotic ecosystems from perennial to intermittent, with consequences for fluvial and groundwater dependent ecosystems. Moreover, water infiltrating from rivers and streams can carry a complex mix of contaminants. Accordingly, the diversity and concentrations of compounds detected in groundwater has been increasing over the past decades. During low flow, stream and river discharge may consist mainly of treated wastewater. In losing stream systems, this contaminated water seeps into the adjoining aquifers. This threatens both ecosystems as well as drinking and irrigation water quality. Climate change is therefore severely altering landscape water balances, with groundwater-surface water-interactions having reached a tipping point in many cases. Current model projections harbor huge uncertainties and scientific evidence for these tipping points remains very limited. In particular, quantitative data on groundwater-surface water-interactions are scarce both on the local and the catchment scale.

Chloride content exceeds 250 mg/l and the groundwater is therefore, according to the German Drinking Water Ordinance, not suitable as drinking water. The chloride content in the aquifer originates from early flooding with seawater which occurred during the Holocene sea level rise. Depth and extent of the salinization were mapped by airborne electromagnetic surveys and validated by groundwater analyses. In the transition zone between the marshlands and geest areas, the fresh-saline groundwater interface falls to a depth of > −175 m NHN. Due to the extensive drainage of the marshlands, seepage of fresh groundwater is impeded. Instead, an upconing of the fresh-saline groundwater interface appears due to an upwardly directed hydraulic gradient. Due to climate change, chloride concentrations will increase along the coastlines. Further inland, a decrease of chloride content in near-surface groundwater will occur. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,Grundwasser,26,4,343-356,,10.1007/s00767-021-00496-w,,#15889,González 2021,,

To consider influences of salinity on locomotor activity of common fish models, we examined behavioral response profiles of two species, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), across a gradient of sodium chloride. Following each experiment, behavior was recorded with automated tracking software and then behavioral response variables, including locomotor (e.g., distance traveled, number of movements, duration of movements) and photolocomotor changes, were examined at several speed thresholds (bursting, cruising, freezing) to identify potential salinity responses. Zebrafish responses were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced at the highest treatment level (5.78 g/L) for multiple behavioral endpoints during both dark and light phases; however, fathead minnow responses were more variable and not consistently concentration dependent. Future efforts are needed to understand behavioral response profiles in combination with anthropogenic contaminants and natural toxins across the freshwater to marine continuum, considering salinization of inland waters, sea level rise, and transport of anthropogenic contaminants and algal toxins from inland waters to coastal systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Arch.

Impact on coastal areas due to sea-level rise, and the temperature rise that will result in increased evaporation and further soil salinization in the coming years. There are more than 100 countries all over the world under the influence of salinity and no land is completely free from salinity. Soil salinization is one of the primary explanations behind soil well-being and microbiome system disintegration in degraded arid and semiarid regions of the world; hence, soil salinity is the most serious factor that influences the development of plants. Germination and developmental process may be affected under the sodic soil condition. Salts influence plants in many ways by making water less accessible, and high saltiness is viewed as a physiological dry season. Depending upon the plants and abiotic/biotic stresses, an imbalance in reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species metabolisms can occur. This leads to nitro-oxidative stress in plants' cell, with antioxidant systems (enzymatic and nonenzymatic), plants' redox status (NADPH, NADH, GSH/GSSG), and other responsive-defensive systems (membrane lipid and protein biosynthesis, mRNA, hormones and ion signaling) being affected differently. In this review, plants’ biochemical mechanisms and major stress-responsive genes under salt stress and interaction with DNA-binding proteins that are controlling these genes and related mechanisms under the salt stress are discussed.

In this study, we assessed the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of amphibian tadpoles in different salinity conditions. We collected tadpoles of Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Fejervarya limnocharis and Microhyla fissipes from coastal areas and housed them in freshwater, low, and high salinity treatments for 7 days of acclimation. The CTmax, survival rate, and development rate of tadpoles in high salinity treatments were significantly lower than that of the two other treatments. Our results indicate that physiological performances and heat tolerances of tadpoles are negatively affected by salinization. Maximum entropy models showed that CTmax and sea-level rise are predicted to negatively affect the distribution of the three focal species. The present results suggest that global warming can lead to negative dual-impacts on coastal animals because of reduced thermal tolerances at elevated salinity. The impacts of global warming on anurans in coastal areas and other habitats impacted by salinization may be more severe than predicted and it is likely to cause similar dual-impacts on other ectotherms. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Sci.

544,"Spatiotemporally explicit prediction of future ecosystem service provisioning in response to climate change, sea level rise, and adaptation strategies","Schibalski, A.; Kleyer, M.; Maier, M.; Schröder, B.","We present a framework to relate the provision of multiple, interacting ecosystem services to climate change and land use adaptation, by combining hydrological process models with statistical species’ distribution models and transfer functions to upscale plot data to the landscape scale. Functional traits of the projected plant communities predict provisional and species conservation services, whereas the hydrological model predicts water-related regulatory services. We applied the framework to coastal areas of the Baltic Sea to predict future ecosystem service outputs in yearly time steps from 2010 to 2100, based on a ‘high emissions’ climate change scenario, a projected sea-level rise of 1.05 m, and four land-management options corresponding to future coastal adaptation strategies. The “Hold the line” strategy implies continual pumping of excess rainwater into the sea to allow farm income from grassland usage, together with high conservation values for rare plants and meadow birds. Towards the end of the century, with an increasing sea-level rise, this results in reverse groundwater flows from sea to land and soil salinization of grasslands. Conversely, “managed realignment” implies the abandonment of pumping, thereby changing grasslands to reeds, reducing farm income and species conservation values, but promoting water retention and carbon sequestration by peat production. Between 2010 and 2100, the time series averaged across all landscape patches masked substantial spatial shifts in the outputs of ecosystem services from lower to higher elevations, emphasizing the relevance of considering both time and space. Multifunctional landscapes, by compromising between provisioning and regulatory ecosystem services, may create the response diversity needed to successfully adapt to climate change and sea-level rise. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Ecosyst.

548,Adaptive responses to salinity stress across multiple life stages in anuran amphibians,"Albecker, M.A.; McCoy, M.W.","Background: In many regions, freshwater wetlands are increasing in salinity at rates exceeding historic levels. Some freshwater organisms, like amphibians, may be able to adapt and persist in salt-contaminated wetlands by developing salt tolerance. Yet adaptive responses may be more challenging for organisms with complex life histories, because the same environmental stressor can require responses across different ontogenetic stages. Here we investigated responses to salinity in anuran amphibians: a common, freshwater taxon with a complex life cycle. We conducted a meta-analysis to define how the lethality of saltwater exposure changes across multiple life stages, surveyed wetlands in a coastal region experiencing progressive salinization for the presence of anurans, and used common garden experiments to investigate whether chronic salt exposure alters responses in three sequential life stages (reproductive, egg, and tadpole life stages) in Hyla cinerea, a species repeatedly observed in saline wetlands. Results: Meta-analysis revealed differential vulnerability to salt stress across life stages with the egg stage as the most salt-sensitive. Field surveys revealed that 25% of the species known to occur in the focal region were detected in salt-intruded habitats. Remarkably, Hyla cinerea was found in large abundances in multiple wetlands with salinity concentrations 450% higher than the tadpole-stage LC50. Common garden experiments showed that coastal (chronically salt exposed) populations of H. cinerea lay more eggs, have higher hatching success, and greater tadpole survival in higher salinities compared to inland (salt naïve) populations. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that some species of anuran amphibians have divergent and adaptive responses to salt exposure across populations and across different life stages. We propose that anuran amphibians may be a novel and amenable natural model system for empirical explorations of adaptive responses to environmental change. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,,Front.

556,Salinization effects on coastal ecosystems: A terrestrial model ecosystem approach,"Pereira, C.S.; Lopes, I.; Abrantes, I.; Sousa, J.P.; Chelinho, S.","In coastal areas, intrusion/irrigation with seawater can threaten biodiversity along with crop yields, and the leaching of salts from areas affected by these processes can increase the salinity of water bodies nearby. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of salinization on coastal soil ecosystems due to saline intrusion/irrigation. Terrestrial model ecosystems were used to simulate two soil salinization scenarios: (i) seawater intrusion and irrigation with distilled water and (ii) seawater intrusion and irrigation with saline water. Three sampling periods were established: T0—after acclimation period; T1—salinization effects; and T2—populations’ recovery. In each sampling period, the abundance of nematodes, enchytraeids, springtails, mites and earthworms, and plant biomass were measured. Immediate negative effects on enchytraeid abundance were detected, especially at the higher level of saltwater via intrusionþirrigation. Eight weeks after the cessation of saline irrigation, the abundance of enchytraeids fully recovered, and some delayed effects were observed in earthworm abundance and plant biomass, especially at the higher soil conductivity level. The observed low capacity of soil to retain salts suggests that, particularly at high soil conductivities, nearby freshwater bodies can also be endangered. Under saline conditions similar to the ones assayed, survival of some soil communities can be threatened, leading to the loss of biodiversity.

560,Salinity-induced increase of the hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone of coastal wetlands,"van Dijk, G.; Nijp, J.J.; Metselaar, K.; Lamers, L.P.M.; Smolders, A.J.P.","In coastal zones globally, salinization is rapidly taking place due to the combined effects of sea level rise, land subsidence, altered hydrology, and climate change. Although increased salinity levels are known to have a great impact on both biogeochemical and hydrological processes in aquatic sediments, only few studies have included both types of processes and their potential interactions. In the present paper, we used a controlled 3-year experimental mesocosm approach to test salinity induced interactions and discuss mechanisms explaining the observed hydrological changes. Surface water salinity was experimentally increased from 14 to 140 mmol Cl per L (0.9 and 9 PSU) by adding sea salt which increased pore water salinity but also increased sulfate reduction rates, leading to higher sulfide, and lower methane concentrations. By analyzing slug test data with different slug test analysis methods, we were able to show that hydraulic conductivity of the hyporheic zone increased 2.8 times by salinization. Based on our hydrological and biogeochemical measurements, we conclude that the combination of pore dilation and decreased methane production rates were major controls on the observed increase in hydraulic conductivity. The slug test analysis method comparison allowed to conclude that the adjusted Bouwer and Rice method results in the most reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity for hyporheic zones. Our work shows that both physical and biogeochemical processes are vital to explain and predict hydrological changes related to the salinization of hyporheic zones in coastal wetlands and provides a robust methodological approach for doing so.

The present study projects the variations of climatic variables such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), Sea Level Rise (SLR), Precipitation (Pr), and pH along the Indian Ocean. Climate projections for 2030, 2050 and 2080 were obtained as MIROC-ESM-CHEM, CMIP5 model output for each Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Each climatic variable was assessed for any change against the reference year of 2015. The RCP scenarios showed an increasing trend for SLR and SST while a decreasing trend for SSS and pH. The study focuses on assessing the impacts of projected variations on marine and aquaculture system. The climate model projections show that the SST during 2080 is likely to rise by 0.69°C for the lowest emissions scenario and 2.6°C for the highest emissions scenario. Elevated temperature disturbs the homeostasis of fish and subjects to physiological stress in the habitat resulting in mortality. These thermal limits can predict distributional changes of marine species in response to climate change. Projections showed no significant changes in the pattern of precipitation. Changes in sea level rise and sea surface salinity reduce water quality, spawning and seed availability, increased disease incidence and damage to freshwater aquaculture system by salinization of groundwater. The results show that variation in SST and pH have a potential impact on marine fisheries while SSS, SLR, Precipitation affects the aquaculture systems. The synergic effects of climatic variations are found to have negative implications on capture fisheries as well as aquaculture system and are elucidated through this work. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.",2019,,J.

562,Effects of climate change on the use of wastewater for aquaculture practices,"Adhikari, S.; Mandal, R.N.","Higher water temperature, sea-level rise and lower precipitation are the manifestations of climate change. Higher temperatures of water and changes in extreme events, like floods and droughts, are responsible for affecting water quality. These extreme events can also pollute water from different sources, like sediments, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, salt and thermal incidence. This polluted water can have negative impacts on ecosystems, human health, water system reliability, etc. In addition, sea-level rise is responsible for extending the areas of groundwater salinization and estuaries, which can decrease the availability of freshwater for humans and ecosystem in coastal areas. With anticipated higher temperature, the quality of wastewater could be very poor. Higher water temperature will facilitate the excessive growth of algal bloom in wastewater which will in turn reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration. Higher temperature will also increase the biological activity of wastewater; the growth of microbial population will be more, which will increase the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater. Because of higher temperature, the organic matter decomposition could increase, and thereby the release of nutrients, viz. nitrogen and phosphorus, will be more in water, which will in turn increase the chance of eutrophication of wastewater. At the same time, the availability of heavy metals and pesticides present in the wastewater could be more to the organisms cultured in the wastewater. If the chance of rainfall is in excess amount, then the wastewater will be diluted, and all the negative qualities of wastewater will be reduced, and the use of the wastewater will be of no problem for aquaculture and agriculture practices. However, if the precipitation reduces particularly in tropics as predicted because of climate change, then the chance of deterioration of wastewater quality will be more. Thus, the operational cost for the wastewater use for aquaculture purposes will be more. In the present paper, these aspects of wastewater use for aquaculture purposes have been discussed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",2019,,"Water Conserv., Recycl. and Reuse: Issues and Chall.",,,107-119,,10.1007/978-981-13-3179-4_6,,#15933,Adhikari 2019,,
566,Comparing Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI in soil salinity detection: a case study of agricultural lands in coastal North Carolina,"Davis, E.; Wang, C.; Dow, K.","This study presents the first comparison of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in identifying soil salinity using soil physiochemical, spectral, statistical, and image analysis techniques. By the end of the century, intermediate sea level rise scenarios project approximately 1.3 meters of sea level rise along the coast of the southeastern United States. One of the most vulnerable areas is Hyde County, North Carolina, where 1140 km2 of agricultural lands are being salinized, endangering 4,200 people and $40 million USD of property. To determine the best multispectral sensor to map the extent of salinization, this study compared the feasibility of OLI and MSI to estimate electrical conductivity (EC). The EC of field samples were correlated with handheld spectrometer spectra resampled into multispectral sensor bands. Using an iterative ordinary least squares regression, it was found that EC was sensitive to OLI bands 2 (452 nm–512 nm) and 4 (636 nm–673 nm) and MSI bands 2 (457.5 nm–522.5 nm) and 4 (650 nm–680 nm). Respectively, the R2Adj and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04–0.54 and 1.15 for OLI, and 0.05–0.67 and 1.17 for MSI, suggests that the two sensors have similar salinity modelling skill. The extracted saline soils make up approximately 1,703 hectares for OLI and 118 hectares for MSI, indicating overestimation from the OLI image due to its coarser spatial resolution. Additionally, field samples indicate that nearby vegetated land is saline, indicating an underestimation of total impacted land. As sea levels rise, accurately monitoring soil salinization will be critical to protecting coastal agricultural lands. MSI’s spatial and temporal resolution makes it superior to OLI for salinity tracking though they have roughly equivalent spectral resolutions. This study demonstrates that visible spectral bands are sensitive to soil salinity with the Blue and Red spectral ranges producing the highest model accuracy; however, the low accuracies for both sensors indicate the need of narrowband sensors.

568,Oceans and Coasts,"Craig, R.K.","Coastal areas are some of the first areas to require climate change adaptation, a result of sea-level rise, exacerbated coastal storms, changing coastal chemistry and biodiversity, and increasing human populations and infrastructure. Coastal adaptation should include a public health perspective, because climate change is simultaneously increasing the risks of coastal disasters, toxic contamination, loss of water supply, and disease. Given the multiple threats facing coastal areas, a public health response must arise from multiple sectors simultaneously, from building codes and land use planning to more traditional disaster and disease preparedness to more finely tuned application of environmental and natural resources laws. This chapter examines climate change’s impacts on the oceans and coasts, then focuses on two types of coastal adaptation. Increasing numbers of increasingly severe coastal storms pose one set of disaster-type public health risks to coastal communities, and this chapter examines prudent disaster preparedness actions to reduce them. However, coasts are also subject to longer-term and often more subtle public health threats as a result of rising seas and warming temperatures, requiring overlapping but distinct public health responses to adapt to salinization and new disease threats. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",2018,,"Climate Change, Public Health, and the Law",,,204-240,,10.1017/9781108278010.009,,#15940,Craig 2018,,

To this end, a one-dimensional modelling approach was used that enabled studying 50 years of variation in discharge and tide in current and future climate. It was found that all locations are increasingly vulnerable to salt intrusion caused by the combination of sea level rise and decreasing river discharges. This affects both the yearly average chloride concentration and long duration exceedances of the threshold value of 150 mg/L. It was also found that diverting a higher fresh water discharge to the Lek of several tens of cubic meters per second reduces the risk of salinization at the upstream inlet locations. However, the increased influence of seawater intrusion on the drinking water inlets cannot be fully compensated for by this measure. The potential gain of the extra water for the drinking water inlets along the Lek has to be balanced against the impact of this measure on water levels and stream flows in other parts of the river system. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,,Clim.,7,4,,,10.3390/cli7040049,,#15950,vandenBrink 2019,,
574,Climate change and tourism - some key issues,"Blagoeva, I.","Tourism is very vulnerable to climate change. Threats to the sector - direct and indirect - are also increasing extreme weather events, increased costs for insurance and security, water shortages, loss of biodiversity and damage or loss of attractions in tourist places. A study by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2016 showed that today, approximately 40% of countries that have prepared national commitments (NDC) recognize tourism either as a priority in their mitigation and adaptation strategies, or as a sector vulnerable to climate change. Climate is often a decisive factor when choosing a tourist destination, whether it is a mild, warm climate for outdoor activities or a cold, snowy climate for skiing. Thus, climate change threatens to change the quality of many tourist destinations around the world. Tourism of small islands, reefs and ski areas is particularly affected by climate change. Tourism, the world's largest industry, also contributes to climate change. About half of the world's air travel is in tourism, and aviation accounts for about 2-3% of all anthropogenic (anthropogenic) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and about 13% of anthropogenic emissions. As the climate warms, climatic zones favorable for tourism will shift towards the poles. Areas that are now comfortable may become too hot. For example, the tourism industry suffered in southern France during the unprecedented European heat of 2003, and such extreme weather events are likely to become more common with global warming. Islands that are no longer above water and reefs that are bleached and lifeless cease to generate tourism income. Losses in the ski industry have already occurred in Austria, Chile, the eastern United States and Switzerland, as winters are shrinking and thaws are becoming more common. Glacier National Park in the United States is likely to be glacier free by 2030. Tourism is the main economic engine for many small islands, where sea level rise due to global warming is projected to accelerate beach erosion, worsen coastal defenses such as coral reefs, and increase the salinization of coastal wells that many island resorts depend on. 1190 islands of the Maldives archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which is one of the main places for beach and underwater tourism, are on average only 39 inches (1 m) above sea level, which is consistent with the range of possible sea level rise by 2100 and will almost certainly be exceeded in the next century or so. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

While there are several species of sedge on the marine plain, only one, a tall salt-tolerant sedge, Schoenoplectus subulatus, regularly provides tall cover and nesting habitat on the marine plain. Comparison of vegetation data between 2002 and 2018 at four breeding sites showed a loss of S. subulatus at two of the sites in conjunction with persistent extreme hypersalinity. In contrast, sites where S. subulatus recovered had elevated salinity levels coinciding with a drought in 2005–2008, but subsequently returning to pre-drought levels. Concomitant with the loss of S. subulatus was a substantial decline in Capricorn Yellow Chat abundance. Possible drivers of persistent hypersalinity were an increase in sea level and consequent greater tidal ingress. The two most severely affected sites were relatively close to tidal influence and low points in the landscape. Evaluation of MSL data showed that habitat decline from 2002 to 2018 occurred over a period in which sea level rose by ~80 mm. While it is recognised that other variables are important, this study indicates that if sea-level rise continues at the 2011–2017 rate of ~8.3 mm per annum, the Curtis Island marine plain will become unsuitable for Capricorn Yellow Chats in the next 60 years or less. Sixty years is likely to be a conservative estimate given that sea-level rise rates are projected to increase further, as are the influence of more extreme weather events such as drought and storm surges on persistence of key vegetation.

576,Unravelling the association between the impact of natural hazards and household poverty: evidence from the Indian Sundarban delta,"Hajra, R.; Szabo, S.; Tessler, Z.; Ghosh, T.; Matthews, Z.; Foufoula-Georgiou, E.","Coastal regions have long been settled by humans due to their abundant resources for livelihoods, including agriculture, transportation, and rich biodiversity. However, natural and anthropogenic factors, such as climate change and sea-level rise, and land subsidence, population pressure, developmental activities, pose threats to coastal sustainability. Natural hazards, such as fluvial or coastal floods, impact poorer and more vulnerable communities greater than more affluent communities. Quantitative assessments of how natural hazards affect vulnerable communities in deltaic regions are still limited, hampering the design of effective management strategies to increase household and community resilience. Drawing from Driving Forces–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR), we quantify the associations between household poverty and the likelihood of material and human loss following a natural hazard using new survey data from 783 households within Indian Sundarban Delta community. The results suggest that the poorest households are significantly more likely to endure material and human losses following a natural hazard and repeated losses of livelihood make them more vulnerable to future risk. The results further suggest that salinization, tidal surge, erosion, and household location are also significant predictors of economic and human losses. Given the current and projected impact of climate change and importance of delta regions as the world’s food baskets, poverty reduction and increase societal resilience should be a primary pathway to strengthen the resilience of the poorest populations inhabiting deltas. © 2017, Springer Japan.",2017,,Sustainability Sci.,12,3,453-464,,10.1007/s11625-016-0420-2,,#15958,Hajra 2017,,

These environments consist of wetland-aquifer systems, which commonly react rapidly to climate changes. Direct evaporation from surface water bodies like lakes, wetlands and lagoons will increase due to temperature increase leading to salt accumulation. To understand the hydrological exchanges between the transitional coastal wetlands of the Variconi oasis, the unconfined aquifer of the Volturno River Delta and the Tyrrenian Sea, the contributions of various processes were monitored and assessed. Physical-chemical parameters like salinity, pH, Eh and temperature were monitored during the hydrological year 2016–2017 on a monthly basis. Moreover, the use of groundwater and surface water equivalent freshwater heads, along with hydraulic conductivity tests and the geological architecture, permitted to connect the salinity variations in the wetlands with the degree of the hydraulic connection between the wetlands, the Volturno River, the Tyrrenian Sea and the coastal aquifer. The results show that the permanent wetlands fed by both the Volturno River and the Tyrrenian Sea, show a smoothed salinity peak during the summer season; while the ephemeral wetlands hydraulically disconnected from the aquifer show high salinity peaks during the summer season due to evapoconcentration processes. Spatial mapping of salinity and other measured parameters, highlighted an elevated heterogeneity of environments (from saline to freshwater environments) enclosed in the Variconi oasis. This in turn, induced a large biodiversity of both autochthonous and migratory species. Despite of this, the projected increase in salinity of these wetlands due to coastal erosion, augmented evapotranspiration rates and sea level rise, could be of serious concern for the above-mentioned biodiversity, thus monitoring and management strategies are urgently required to preserve this and other oasis in the Mediterranean area that are key sites employed as stop-over along migratory routes. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2020,,Springer.

580,Circulating risks: Coastal cities and the spectre of climate change risk,"Gotham, K.F.; Cannon, C.","Climate change is an urgent problem for coastal regions already facing the challenges of urbanization, overcrowding, subsidence and nutrient loading. Global mean temperatures are on the rise, ice sheets and glaciers are rapidly melting, and sea levels are rising (Nicholls et al. 2007; for an overview, see Moser et al. 2012). Scientists expect sea-level rise to exacerbate existing risks such as coastal flooding, coastal land loss, rising water tables and drainage problems, and salinization of coastal environments (Blum and Roberts 2009; Gonzalez and Tornqvist 2006; IPCC 2014; Karl 2009; National Academy of Sciences 2003: 4; Stern 2007; USGCRP 2013). Apart from climate change, predicted land loss combined with increasing population growth in coastal areas could endanger regional economies, threaten sources of fresh water, and alter land cover patterns and ecosystem services (e.g. provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; and cultural services such as spiritual, recreational and cultural benefits) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). “The scope, severity, and pace of future climate change impacts are difficult to predict”, according to the White House Council on Environmental Quality (2010: 6), but “coastal areas will need to prepare for rising sea levels and increased flooding.” Adding to the challenge of responding to these impacts, climate-related changes will likely exacerbate the impacts of other non-climatic risks and stressors such as pervasive inequality, jurisdictional fragmentation, fiscal strains, ageing infrastructure, habitat destruction and pollution (IPCC 2014). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Kevin Ward, Andrew E.G.

The results indicate that the elements Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Sr2+ and Li+ are mobilized from the aquifer matrix during seawater intrusion, whereas the alkali-elements Na+, K+ and Rb+ are removed from solution, possibly due to cationic exchange process. The anions HCO3– and SO42− and the elements I and B are mobilized due to carbonate mineral weathering, whereas dissolved silica and the halides Br− and F− behave conservatively during salinization. Groundwater NO3− is provided by sewage infiltration. Regarding trace elements behavior, we identify three groups: i) elements that are mobilized during saline intrusion (Fe, Co, V, Se, Re), ii) elements revealing low or no mobilization (Mo, Ni, Cr, Ta, W) and iii) elements that show an undefined tendency (U, As, Ge, Sb, Cu, Mn). The U and NO3− levels in groundwater should be considered carefully because several wells have concentrations close to the permissible levels.

Subsurface drainage offers a practical solution to the problem of upward artesian water movement and the simultaneous downward flow of excess irrigation water, to mitigate the salinization in the root zone. Subsurface draining systems can contribute to mitigate the vulnerability to climate change and to the increased anthropic pressure insofar they are able to receive the incremented flow rate due to the foreseen scenarios of sea level rise, recharge and subsidence. This paper introduces a rational design of subsurface drainage systems in coastal aquifers, taking into account the increment of flow in the draining pipes due to future possible conditions of sea level rise, artificial recharge and subsidence within time horizons that are compatible with the expected lifespan of a buried drainage system. The approach proposed in this paper is characterized by the assessment of the incremental flow through the drains as a function of various possible scenarios at different time horizons. Our calculations show that the impact on the discharge into the existing subsurface drainage system under the new foreseen conditions is anything but negligible. Thus, future climate-related scenarios deeply impact the design of such hydraulic structures, and must be taken into account in the frame of the next water management strategies for safeguarding agricultural activities in the Nile delta and in similar coastal contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Sci.

608,Adaptation analysis for environmental change in coastal communities,"Mostofi Camare, H.; Lane, D.E.","Small islands and coastal communities around the world are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, mainly from storm surge attributed to more frequent and severe coastal storms, and mounting sea-level rise. Coastal hazards including inundation, salinisation of the water supply, and land erosion all threaten vital infrastructure that support coastal communities. This research, part of the International Community-University Research Alliance (ICURA) C-Change project ""Managing Adaptation to Environmental Change in Coastal Communities: Canada and the Caribbean"", develops and applies a multicriteria decision evaluation and support system for evaluating adaptation options for coastal communities. The paper estimates vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity measures associated with adaptation strategies in coastal communities with respect to their environmental, economic, social, and cultural dimensions. Results are determined using a multi-participant formulation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for identifying multicriteria decisions as adaptation strategies in a specific coastal context. The application of the framework is conducted for the coastal community of Little Anse on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia. Specifically, the state of the Little Anse breakwater is analysed and adaptation options for protecting, accommodating, and retreating are presented and evaluated in the face of predicted storm scenarios. The results indicate that, in the case of Little Anse, the strategic decision to protect the community by a new breakwater arm provides preferred measures for resilience and adaptive capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,,Socio-Econ.

615,Scenario Modelling of Climate Change's Impact on Salinization of Coastal Water Resources in Reclaimed Lands,"Colombani, N.; Mastrocicco, M.","A numerical model accounting for variable density flow and transport was built up to quantify the actual and future (2050) salinization trends of a coastal aquifer in the Po delta (Northern Italy). SEAWAT 4.0 was employed to model the interaction between the surface drainage system and the underlying aquifer. PEST was employed for inverse parameter calibration using hydraulic heads and groundwater salinities as constraints. The calibrated model was used to predict the behavior of the coastal aquifer using a multiple scenario approach: increase in evapotranspiration induced by temperature increase; increase in the frequency of extreme high rainfall events; extreme drought conditions; and irrigation canals dewatering due to salinization of the Po River branches. For each scenario, two sub-scenarios were established to account for the projected local sea level rise. The first three scenarios have only minimal effects on the aquifer salinization, while the fourth forecasts a severe aquifer salinization due to enhanced upward fluxes of saline and hypersaline groundwater. The scenarios quantified the possible future salinization trends of groundwater and could be useful to identify adaptation strategies which allow to better manage water resources of this and similar areas. Results show that the Po delta will experience a significant salinization by 2050 and that the major cause is autonomous salinization via seepage of saline groundwater rather than enhanced salt-water intrusion due to sea level rise. The enhanced autonomous salinization will increase the salt export into the drainage canals that are also employed for irrigation, posing serious treats to the local flourishing agricultural economy. © 2016 The Authors.",2016,,Procedia Eng.,162,,25-31,,10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.006,,#16022,Colombani 2016,,

Although salinization is known to have a great influence on biogeochemical processes, literature shows contrasting effects that challenge the prediction of future effects. In addition, the effects of fluctuating salinity levels, a more realistic scenario than constant levels, on nutrient cycling in coastal wetland sediments have hardly been examined. A better understanding is therefore crucial for the prediction of future effects and the definition of effective management. To test the effects of constantly brackish water (50 mmol Cl l−1, 3.2 psu) or fluctuating salinity (5–50 mmol Cl l−1), versus constantly low salinity (5 mmol Cl l−1, 0.32 psu) on nutrient biogeochemistry, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with either peat or clay sediments from coastal wetlands. Increased salinity showed to have a fast and large effect. Sediment cation exchange appeared to be the key process explaining both a decrease in phosphorus availability (through calcium mobilization) and an increase in nitrogen availability, their extent being strongly dependent on sediment type. Supply of brackish water decreased surface water turbidity and inhibited sediment methane production but did not affect CO2 production. Constant and fluctuating salinity levels showed similar longer term effects on nutrient and carbon cycling. The contrasting effects of salinization found for nitrogen and phosphorus, and its effects on water turbidity indicate major ecological consequences for coastal wetlands and have important implications for water management and nature restoration. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",2015,,Biogeochemistry,126,1-2,71-84,,10.1007/s10533-015-0140-1,,#16028,vanDijk 2015,,

Estimations of these parameters allows to assess the future development of the whole system. Constant parameters are geological and geomorphologic composition of the coast and its wind-wave mode. Variables arc long-period fluctuations of water level due to custatic variations, tectonic and glacio-isostatic movements. Prediction of the evolution of the coastal zone includes the assessment of the trends of the variable parameters of the morpholithodynamics system. In this study, the above problem is analyzed on the examples of south-eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and the Russian sector of the Caspian sea. The possible rise of the Baltic Sea level by 1.0-1.5 m by the end of the XXI century will result in the further destruction of sea coasts, flooding, waterlogging and salinization of coastal areas, which will lead to negative consequences for industrial, municipal and agricultural infrastructures. In the ease of the Caspian Sea, the majority of its coasts regardless of the underwater slope has transformed into lagoons due to the sea level rise in rcccnt decades. Coastal erosion will start only when the sea level reaches the 1929 yr stage from which the sea level drop started in the mid XX century. At this stage, a noticeable change of surface slope occurs.

630,Impact of topography on groundwater salinization due to ocean surge inundation,"Yu, X.; Yang, J.; Graf, T.; Koneshloo, M.; O'Neal, M.A.; Michael, H.A.","Sea-level rise and increases in the frequency and intensity of ocean surges caused by climate change are likely to exacerbate adverse effects on low-lying coastal areas. The landward flow of water during ocean surges introduces salt to surficial coastal aquifers and threatens groundwater resources. Coastal topographic features (e.g., ponds, dunes, barrier islands, and channels) likely have a strong impact on overwash and salinization processes, but are generally highly simplified in modeling studies. To understand topographic impacts on groundwater salinization, we modeled a theoretical overwash event and variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in 3-D using the fully coupled surface and subsurface numerical simulator, HydroGeoSphere. The model simulates the coastal aquifer as an integrated system considering overland flow, coupled surface and subsurface exchange, variably saturated flow, and variable-density groundwater flow. To represent various coastal landscape types, we simulated both synthetic fields and real-world coastal topography from Delaware, USA. The groundwater salinization assessment suggested that the topographic connectivity promoting overland flow controls the volume of aquifer that is salinized. In contrast, the amount of water that can be stored in surface depressions determines the amount of seawater that infiltrates the subsurface and the time for seawater to flush from the aquifer. Our study suggests that topography has a significant impact on groundwater salinization due to ocean surge overwash, with important implications for coastal land management and groundwater vulnerability assessment. © 2016.

632,"Storm-surge flooding on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska","Terenzi, J.; Jorgenson, M.T.; Ely, C.R.","Coastal regions of Alaska are regularly affected by intense storms of ocean origin, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to increase as a result of global climate change. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), situated in western Alaska on the eastern edge of the Bering Sea, is one of the largest deltaic systems in North America. Its low relief makes it especially susceptible to storm-driven flood tides and increases in sea level. Little information exists on the extent of flooding caused by storm surges in western Alaska and its effects on salinization, shoreline erosion, permafrost thaw, vegetation, wildlife, and the subsistence-based economy. In this paper, we summarize storm flooding events in the Bering Sea region of western Alaska during 1913 – 2011 and map both the extent of inland flooding caused by autumn storms on the central YKD, using Radarsat-1 and MODIS satellite imagery, and the drift lines, using high-resolution IKONOS satellite imagery and field surveys. The largest storm surges occurred in autumn and were associated with high tides and strong (> 65 km hr−1) southwest winds. Maximum inland extent of flooding from storm surges was 30.3 km in 2005, 27.4 km in 2006, and 32.3 km in 2011, with total flood area covering 47.1%, 32.5%, and 39.4% of the 6730 km2 study area, respectively. Peak stages for the 2005 and 2011 storms were 3.1 m and 3.3 m above mean sea level (amsl), respectively—almost as high as the 3.5 m amsl elevation estimated for the largest storm observed (in November 1974). Several historically abandoned village sites lie within the area of inundation of the largest flood events. With projected sea level rise, large storms are expected to become more frequent and cover larger areas, with deleterious effects on freshwater ponds, non-saline habitats, permafrost, and landscapes used by nesting birds and local people. © 2014 The Arctic Institute of North America.",2014,,Arctic,67,3,360-374,,10.14430/arctic4403,,#16044,Terenzi 2014,,
633,Cultural dynamics of adaptation to climate change: An example from the east coast of the US,"Martinez, G.; Paolisso, M.J.","This contribution explores the role of culture in relation to local knowledge and values as displayed in the interpretations and actions of distinct groups of residents, concerning adapting to climate change in Dorchester County. Situated in the Mid-Atlantic area on the East Coast of the US, Dorchester County is at risk due to projected high sea level rise, flooding, salinisation and increased erosion. The research is based on a theoretical position that interpretation of risks and responses by distinct groups are shaped by frames or systems of cultural knowledge and values. For our study region, we were interested in which ways local knowledge and values of major cultural groups (e.g. watermen, farmers, winemakers, trappers), shape their understanding and perceptions of climate change risks, and in turn the consequences of that cultural knowledge in terms of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience. Our research also includes perspectives of under-represented, poor African Americans for whom threats posed by natural hazards and anthropogenic changes are disproportionately proximate. Furthermore, we incorporate perspectives of employees from the local zoning and planning department, views that allow us to better understand the policy contexts of our study groups' different cultural perspectives. Methodologically speaking, our findings are based on ethnographic methods (including qualitative interviews with key cultural groups in Dorchester County, and a quantitative survey from a workshop with coastal authorities from several Chesapeake Bay counties) as well as document analysis. In particular, we focus on images of nature, sense of place and change, risk perception and barriers. In addition, we also consider socio-economic factors such as economic development and public and private (coastal) property issues. We found that the beliefs and values of a distinct group of people in a given region shape their perceptions of climate change and hence their responses to changes in the environment and their communities. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill nv, Leiden, The Netherlands.

This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50. years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater-saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings. Multidisciplinary research is warranted to evaluate interactions between SI and submarine groundwater discharge, ecosystem health and unsaturated zone processes. Recent advances in numerical simulation, calibration and optimization techniques require rigorous field-scale application to contemporary issues of climate change, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic and ecological factors that are inseparable elements of SI management. The number of well-characterized examples of SI is small, and this has impeded understanding of field-scale processes, such as those controlling mixing zones, saltwater upconing, heterogeneity effects and other factors. Current SI process understanding is based mainly on numerical simulation and laboratory sand-tank experimentation to unravel the combined effects of tides, surface water-groundwater interaction, heterogeneity, pumping and density contrasts.

This disappearance is regarded as irreversible and the clear evidence for the complete responsibility of global warming. It raises questions therefore about the legal reality of a deterritorialized State, and about the identity of a community forced into exile. There is a striking gap between the dreamlike image associated with a tropical coral archipelago and the hard daily life of its inhabitants in a poor environment. More than the inescapable sea level rise, they are mostly concerned with rainfall deficits, the profusion of household waste, water-supply salinization and pollution of their fresh water lens. This is particularly true on the main island, Fongafale, where more than 5 000 inhabitants are living on less than 150 hectares. Although confronted with these alarmist forecasts, the Tuvaluans refuse to anticipate the end of the 21st Century presumed to be the moment when they would be forced to become the first “climate refugees”. They are attached to their territory despite their hard life, but are still far from being mobilized to overcome the difficulties they have to face, in obvious contrast with the idyllic image associated with coral islands. © Armand Colin.",2015,,Ann.

638,Influence of sea-level rise on freshwater lenses of different atoll island sizes and lens resilience to storm-induced salinization,"Chui, T.F.M.; Terry, J.P.","Human populations inhabiting remote coral atoll islands in the tropical Pacific Ocean rely heavily on thin unconfined fresh groundwater lenses (FWLs) as their main natural source of potable water. Potential threats to the continuing viability of atoll FWLs may be associated with eustatic sea-level rise (SLR), but little is known about the influence of SLR on the FWLs of different atoll island sizes and the resilience of FWLs to salinization caused by storm-induced wave washover of low-lying land. Here, numerical modelling is carried out to generate steady-state FWL configurations at three chosen island sizes (400, 600 and 800. m widths), upon which a 40. cm SLR scenario is imposed, followed by transient simulations to assess saline damage and recovery over a 1-year period after a storm washover event on a 600. m wide island.Two different approaches are tested for taking into account the existence of a freshwater swamp, formed where a topographic depression exposes the central region of a FWL above the ground surface. These 'groundwater window' and 'specified flux' approaches yield similar results, implying that complex integrated surface and groundwater modelling may be unnecessary to develop realistic models of FWL configuration where central freshwater swamps exist. Thereafter, steady-state solutions indicate how FWL dimensions are not related in a linear manner to atoll island size, such that smaller islands develop much more restricted lenses than larger islands. Partly in consequence, smaller FWLs display greater potential for disturbance by SLR, while larger and more robust FWLs may show more resilience. Results from simulation of saline damage caused by storm washover produce a somewhat counterintuitive finding: in a post-SLR situation it is apparent that FWL vulnerability to washover salinization may actually be reduced, owing to the thinner layer of unsaturated substrate lying above the water table (i.e. FWL surface), into which saline water can infiltrate and accumulate during a storm washover event. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,,J.

643,Influence of salinity and prey presence on the survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates of a freshwater marsh,"Kang, S.-R.; King, S.L.","Salinization of coastal freshwater environments is a global issue. Increased salinity from sea level rise, storm surges, or other mechanisms is common in coastal freshwater marshes of Louisiana, USA. The effects of salinity increases on aquatic macroinvertebrates in these systems have received little attention, despite the importance of aquatic macroinvertebrates for nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and as a food source for vertebrate species. We used microcosm experiments to evaluate the effects of salinity, duration of exposure, and prey availability on the relative survival of dominant aquatic macroinvertebrates (i. e., Procambarus clarkii Girard, Cambarellus puer Hobbs, Libellulidae, Dytiscidae cybister) in a freshwater marsh of southwestern Louisiana. We hypothesized that increased salinity, absence of prey, and increased duration of exposure would decrease survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates and that crustaceans would have higher survival than aquatic insect taxon. Our first hypothesis was only partially supported as only salinity increases combined with prolonged exposure duration affected aquatic macroinvertebrate survival. Furthermore, crustaceans had higher survival than aquatic insects. Salinity stress may cause mortality when acting together with other stressful conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

A lesser known impact occurs if rising sea level elevates water tables above interior topographic lows to form lakes. Impacts of lake formation on water resources, however, remain unquantified. Here we use hydrological models, based on islands in the Bahamian archipelago, to demonstrate that on islands with negative water budgets, evaporation following lake inundation can cause more than twice the loss of fresh groundwater resources relative to an equivalent amount of coastal inundation. This result implies that in dry climates, low-lying islands with inland depressions could face substantially greater threats to their water resources from sea level rise than previously considered. ©2016.

651,The effect of climate and anthropogenic sea level changes on Israeli coastal aquifers,"Yechieli, Y.; Kafri, U.; Shalev, E.","This review summarizes several aspects related to the effect of climate and anthropogenic sea level changes on the Israeli coastal aquifers of the Mediterranean Sea (rise of ~1 cm/a) and the Dead Sea (drop of ~1 m/a). Numerical simulations show that the effect of global future sea-level rise will depend on the specific configuration of the aquifer and its connection to the sea. An important factor is the coastal topography next to the shoreline, whereby in the case of a steep coastal topography, no significant salinization is expected due to sea-level rise. Reduced recharge due to climate change or over-exploitation of groundwater is also expected to enhance the inland shift of the fresh- saline water interface. A significant fast response of groundwater system to changes in the base levels is observed in the Dead Sea coastal aquifer, both in simulations and in the field. This is exhibited by the drop of the adjacent groundwater levels as well as by the shift of the fresh- saline water interface. Also, in most parts of the Dead Sea aquifer, a fast freshening process is taking place due to the drop of groundwater level and seaward retreat of the interface. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2011,,Climate Change Effects on Groundw.

657,Deltas at risk,"Syvitski, J.P.M.","The long-term sustainability of populated deltas is often more affected by large-scale engineering projects than sea-level rise associated with global warming and the global ocean volume increase. On deltas, the rate of relative eustatic sea-level rise is often smaller than the rate for isostatic-controlled subsidence and of the same order of magnitude as natural sediment compaction. Accelerated compaction associated with petroleum and groundwater mining can exceed natural subsidence rates by an order of magnitude. The reduction in sediment delivery to deltas due to trapping behind dams, along with the human control of routing river discharge across delta plains, contributes to the sinking of world deltas. Consequences include shoreline erosion, threatened mangroves swamps and wetlands, increased salinization of cultivated land, and hundreds of millions of humans put at risk. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008.",2008,,Sustainability Sci.,3,1,23-32,,10.1007/s11625-008-0043-3,,#16080,Syvitski 2008,,
658,Sea level rise impacts on rice production: The Ebro Delta as an example,"Genua-Olmedo, A.; Alcaraz, C.; Caiola, N.; Ibáñez, C.","Climate change and sea level rise (SLR) are global impacts threatening the sustainability of coastal territories and valuable ecosystems such as deltas. The Ebro Delta is representative of the vulnerability of coastal areas to SLR. Rice cultivation is the main economic activity in the region. Rice fields occupy most of the delta (ca. 65%) and are vulnerable to accelerated SLR and consequent increase in soil salinity, the most important physical factor affecting rice production. We developed a model to predict the impacts of SLR on soil salinity and rice production under different scenarios predicted by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by coupling data from Geographic Information Systems with Generalized Linear Models. Soil salinity data were measured in agricultural parcels and rice production from surveys among farmers. The correlation between observed and soil salinity predicted values was high and significant (Pearson's r = 0.72, P < 0.0001), thus supporting the predictive ability of the model. Soil salinity was directly related to distances to the river, to the delta inner border, and to the river old mouth, while clay presence, winter river flow and surface elevation were inversely related to it. Surface elevation was the most important variable in explaining soil salinity. Rice production was negatively influenced by soil salinity, thus the models predict a decrease from higher elevation zones close to the river to the shoreline. The model predicts a maximum reduction in normalized rice production index from 61.2% in 2010 to 33.8% by 2100 in the worst considered scenario (SLR = 1.8 m), with a decrease of profit up to 300 € per hectare. The model can be applied to other deltaic areas worldwide, and help rice farmers and stakeholders to identify the most vulnerable areas to SLR impacts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,,Sci.

660,"Implications of climate change on the groundwater flow regime and geochemistry of the Nile Delta, Egypt","Geriesh, M.H.; Balke, K.-D.; El-Rayes, A.E.; Mansour, B.M.","Environmental isotope analyses in conjunction with the hydro-geochemical investigations and tentative reviewing of the paleoclimatic sea level changes are carried out to fingerprint the implications of climatic changes on the groundwater flow regime and geochemistry at the Nile Delta. Following up the footprints of groundwater flow history, it is observed that the Pleistocene, main groundwater aquifer of the Nile Delta was drained and refilled with Nile water several times due to the eustatic sea level propagations between dry and wet periods. Therefore, the present-day groundwater flow regime could be affected by the latest Holocene phase of climate changes during which no significant dramatic sea level changes were recorded. After the time slice of the Mediterranean humid phase, 8000-5500 BP, the sea level started to rise steeply from –15 m to the present-day level. Under this rising rate, the seawater invaded most of the northern delta lope and several 10ths of kilometres inland via the mouths of the ancient Nile branches. During these arid conditions, deterioration of the Pleistocene unconfined aquifer could take place. This finding matches a famine and economic instabilities during the arid periods and flourishing and economic stabilities during the humid pluvial periods along the history of the ancient Egyptian civilization. In accordance to the latest active sea level rise stage in conjunction with the delta subsidence, a contagious groundwater level rise with a recent order of 3 cm/year is taking place leading to form several lake-like lagoons, water logging and soil salinization along the coastal plain and the eastern low lands. The Nile Delta is expected to suffer extreme soil salinization and gradual merging under the groundwater logging and seawater transgression especially, along the eastern coastal zone which suffers a high subsidence rate of about 5 mm/year. In contrast to previous studies, our findings show that, the present groundwater composition and salinity in the Nile Delta aquifers cannot be attributed to a recent seawater intrusion. The physico-chemical processes that explain this composition are combination of salt dissolution (mainly from Holocene fluvio-marine aquifer), flushing by recent Nile water, ion exchange and evaporation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2015,,J.

To monitor changes in Habitat types in a dune and salt meadow area in the eastern part of the back-barrier island of Ameland (The Netherlands) a sampling scheme was designed suitable for both unbiased estimation of such changes and for mapping the Habitat types. As a space-time design a supplemented panel was chosen, with a proportion of permanent plots of 0.5. Sampling plots were selected by probability sampling, with sampling designs that spread the plots evenly over the study area. These design decisions are motivated in the paper. Eight vegetation types were distinguished, corresponding to six Habitat types. The areal extent of the 'grey dunes' type significantly decreased over the observation period, whereas the extents of two 'salt meadow' types significantly increased. This has to be considered as a loss of habitat quality. It is doubtful whether for the Natura 2000 area in its entirety, wherein we expect smaller rates of change compared to our study area, it will be possible to detect areal changes in Habitat types at acceptable costs and within the requested six-year periods.

665,Responding to the challenges of climate change in the Pacific Islands: Management and technological imperatives,"Nunn, P.D.","Pacific Island nations face similar challenges from climate change to those faced by other developing nations, yet these are exacerbated by the comparative smallness, remoteness, and archipelagic character of many of the islands. Proposed solutions to the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands have often been uncritically imposed from elsewhere and have often proved unsuited to both their environmental and cultural contexts. Effective solutions to challenges of climate change in the Pacific Islands should acknowledge their unique environmental characteristics, particularly their high insularity (coastal length to land area) ratios, their topographic and geological diversity, and the raw materials available to support adaptation. It is important for policy makers to understand the cultural influences that have helped shape current environmental decision making, and the ways in which adaptations to climate change can be sustained. The efficacy of donor preferences for aid funding of policy development (top-down) rather than empowering community-level decision-makers (bottom-up) is questionable. Pacific Island governments are focused on economic growth, with little tangible investment in non-profit environmental sustainability. In the future they should take on ownership of the climate-change adaptation process to a greater degree than they do at present, with external assistance brought in only for special cases and for the trialling of novel solutions, rather than for routine adaptation. Globally, there should be less emphasis on sea-level rise as the principal challenge posed by climate change to Pacific Island nations and a better appreciation of the other challenges, particularly inundation and salinization of economically critical lowland, as well as coral-reef degradation. © Inter-Research 2009.",2009,,Clim.

667,"Hydrologic exchanges and baldcypress water use on deltaic hummocks, Louisiana, USA","Hsueh, Y.-H.; Chambers, J.L.; Krauss, K.W.; Allen, S.T.; Keim, R.F.","Coastal forested hummocks support clusters of trees in the saltwater–freshwater transition zone. To examine how hummocks support trees in mesohaline sites that are beyond physiological limits of the trees, we used salinity and stable isotopes (2H and 18O) of water as tracers to understand water fluxes in hummocks and uptake by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.), which is the most abundant tree species in coastal freshwater forests of the southeastern U.S. Hummocks were always partially submerged and were completely submerged 1 to 8% of the time during the two studied growing seasons, in association with high water in the estuary. Salinity, δ18O, and δ2H varied more in the shallow open water than in groundwater. Surface water and shallow groundwater were similar to throughfall in isotopic composition, which suggested dominance by rainfall. Salinity of groundwater in hummocks increased with depth, was higher than in swales, and fluctuated little over time. Isotopic composition of xylem water in baldcypress was similar to the vadose zone and unlike other measured sources, indicating that trees preferentially use unsaturated hummock tops as refugia from higher salinity and saturated soil in swales and the lower portions of hummocks. Sustained upward gradients of salinity from groundwater to surface water and vadose water, and low variation in groundwater salinity and isotopic composition, suggested long residence time, limited exchange with surface water, and that the shallow subsurface of hummocks is characterized by episodic salinization and slow dilution.

The possible reasons for rapid SLR at the permanent tide gauge station located on the southern coast of the Marmara Sea have been investigated based on time series data recorded since 1984. The population in the region relies mainly on groundwater resources for urban, tourism and agricultural water use, which represents a severe risk with regard to the replenishment of the coastal aquifer.

674,Global assessment of vulnerability to sea-level rise in topography-limited and recharge-limited coastal groundwater systems,"Michael, H.A.; Russoniello, C.J.; Byron, L.A.","Impacts of rising sea level on the hydraulic balance between aquifers and the ocean threaten fresh water resources and aquatic ecosystems along many world coastlines. Understanding the vulnerability of groundwater systems to these changes and the primary factors that determine the magnitude of system response is critical to developing effective management and adaptation plans in coastal zones. We assessed the vulnerability of two types of groundwater systems, recharge-limited and topography-limited, to changes caused by sea-level rise over a range of hydrogeologic settings. Vulnerability in this context is defined by the rate and magnitude of salinization of coastal aquifers and changes in groundwater flow to the sea. Two-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport simulations indicate that the response of recharge-limited systems is largely minimal, whereas topography-limited systems are vulnerable for various combinations of permeability, vertical anisotropy in permeability, and recharge. World coastlines were classified according to system type as a vulnerability indicator. Results indicate that approximately 70% of world coastlines may be topography-limited, though variability in hydrogeologic conditions strongly affects classification. Future recharge and sea-level rise scenarios have much less influence on the proportion of vulnerable coastlines than differences in permeability, distance to a hydraulic divide, and recharge, indicating that hydrogeologic properties and setting are more important factors to consider in determining system type than uncertainties in the magnitude of sea-level rise and hydrologic shifts associated with future climate change. © 2013.

676,Water sustainability and climate change in the EU and global context - Policy and research responses,"Quevauviller, P.","Climate change impacts on the hydrological cycle (e.g. effects on atmospheric water vapour content, changes of precipitation patterns) have been linked to observed warming over several decades. Higher water temperatures and changes in extremes, including floods and droughts, are projected to affect water quality and exacerbate many forms of water pollution with possible negative impacts on ecosystems and human health, as well as water system reliability and operating costs. In addition, sea-level rise is projected to extend areas of salinisation of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease of freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. Besides this, changes in water quantity and quality due to climate change are expected to affect food availability, water access and utilisation, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, as well as the operation of water infrastructure (e.g. hydropower, flood defences, irrigation systems). This chapter discusses how climate change might impact the reliability of current water management systems on the basis of expert reports prepared at global or EU level, namely reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and guidance documents of the Water Framework Directive Common Implementation Strategy. Examples of international research trends are described to illustrate on-going efforts to improve understanding and modelling of climate changes related to the hydrological cycles at scales that are relevant to decision making (possibly linked to policy). © Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",2011,,Issues Environm.

678,Seawater intrusion in response to sea-level rise in a coastal aquifer with a general-head inland boundary,"Lu, C.; Xin, P.; Li, L.; Luo, J.","Seawater intrusion in response to sea-level rise has been studied extensively in recent years by assuming largely a constant-head or constant-flux inland boundary condition. However, these two types of boundary conditions are not sufficient when the inland edge of the model domain is neither natural groundwater nor known hydraulic boundaries. Under these circumstances, a general-head inland boundary condition capable of characterizing the hydraulic response of model boundaries is needed. Previous studies adopting the general-head inland boundary condition to assess coastal aquifer vulnerability to sea-level rise are limited and all based on numerical modeling. In this study, we derive analytical solutions of the interface toe location in both confined and unconfined coastal systems with a general-head inland boundary condition. Comparison among the performances of the three different types of inland boundary conditions in evaluating the sea-level rise impact on aquifer salinization is carried out by assuming the same initial system condition. It is found that the displacement of the interface toe predicted using a general-head inland boundary is between those of using a constant-head (upper bound) and constant-flux (lower bound) inland boundary, depending on the values of two general-head boundary parameters (i.e., hydraulic conductance and reference head). More importantly, analytical solutions developed could serve as a tool for calibrating the two boundary parameters defined in the general-head boundary condition for site-specific assessments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015,,J.

681,Modelling of the effect of a sea-level rise and land subsidence on the evolution of the groundwater density in the subsoil of the northern part of the Netherlands,"Van Der Meij, J.L.; Minnema, B.","The Province of Friesland is conducting a study on possible future changes in the surface water and groundwater systems of Friesland. The aim of the study is to assess what changes might be caused by land subsidence and a rise in sea level - focusing in particular on the salinization of the surface water - by modelling the flow of groundwater in the coastal zone of the Province of Friesland. A three-dimensional density distribution of groundwater (based on the chloride distribution in the groundwater) can be projected by using the density dependent version of the MLAEM software: MVAEM (Strack, O.D.L., 1989. Multi-layer aquifer modeling using the analytical element method. Proc. 4th Int. Conf. on the use of models to findworking solutions to groundwater problems, National Water Well Association, Dublin, Ohio, USA, 1995). Construction of a fully three-dimensional density distribution is based on irregularly spaced chloride concentration data points. These are interpolated using a three-dimensional multi-quadric interpolator (in MVAEM). For some parts of the model area, chloride data were not available (e.g. the Wadden Sea); for these regions chloride concentrations were estimated (based on geo-electric and other information) and assigned to artificial data points, which were added to the data set. The techniques used for this process were developed during the construction of the coastal elements in NAGROM - the NAtional GROundwater Model for The Netherlands (De Lange, W.J., van der Meij, J.L., 1995. NAGROM (National GROundwater Model). RIZA, Lelystad, TNO-GG, Delft, The Netherlands; De Lange, W.J., 1996. Groundwater modeling of large domains with analytic elements. Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands). The influences of a sea-level rise and land subsidence on the groundwater system were simulated by computational modelling of density-driven groundwater flow. The groundwater model that was used is a refined version of the regional model contained in NAGROM, based on the analytic element method (Strack, 1989). NAGROM is a national water management tool for evaluating different water conservation and distribution policies. It was developed by the Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment in co-operation with The Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience TNO (NITG-TNO). The effect of a sea-level rise and land subsidence was calculated for a 50-year period. Salinization of the surface waters by discharged groundwater in the Northern part of The Netherlands was compared with the evolution of the region not including sea-level rise and land subsidence. The amount of saline discharge as part of the surface water balance was calculated under special boundary conditions set according to the proposed sea-level rise and land subsidence in a semi-unsteady state.

688,Assessment of vulnerable scope to environmental change in Jiangsu Coastal Plain,"Yang, G.; Shi, Y.; Zhang, C.; Liang, H.","This paper develops the method of delimiting vulnerable scope and assessing coastal vulnerability through the observation and sampling in the field and applying the means of remote sensing and GIS, which can be suitable for great river delta and coastal plains with great area, relative complex micro-geomorphology and the protection of seawall. The vulnerable scope should include inundated tidal flats due to sea level rise, coastal lowlands of soil salinization caused by rising phreatic water level and the area directly harmed by exacerbating storm surges due to sea level rise. The Jiangsu Coastal Plain is low-flat, where considerable part of habitable lands are below local mean high tidal level (3 m above sea level) and depend on the protection of low standard seawall. So this area is the most vulnerable to sea level rise and exacerbating coastal hazards. Applying above-mentioned method, the coastal vulnerability of Jiangsu Coastal Plain to relative sea level rise (approximately 50 cm up to 2050 yr) and exacerbating storm surge has been assessed. The results show that, up to the 2050 yr, the Jiangsu Coastal Plain will probably loss 12.8% of tidal flats (about 6.7 X 104 hm2) and 7.7% of cultivated land (about 8.2 X 104 hm2). Meanwhile, 2.0% of population, 5.9% of original value of fixed capital, 4.1% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), 53.3% of salt industry and 6.8% of aquiculture respectively will be affected, due to coastal environmental change. The coastal vulnerability degree (CVD) of the whole area belongs to medium grade (the index between 0 and 1 is 0.56). In view of different coast sections, CVD of the northern area of Guanhe River Mouth and Abandoned Huanghe River Delta belong to high grade (the indexes reach 0.81 and 0.63 respectively), these of the northern part of Middle Coastal Plain and the northern part of the Changjiang River Delta belong to medium grade too (the indexes are 0.45 and 0.46 respectively). that of the southern of Middle Coastal Plain belongs to the lowest grade (the index is 0.31).",2000,,Acta Geogr.

A geographic information system (GIS) has been built including layers of land use, topography, archeological sites, land cover and population. Analysis of data has been carried out to assess vulnerability of various land use and land cover classes to the impact of sea level rise. Because the area under study has geomorphic relief profiles just over the sea level, inundation of total land could reach 26% of total study area due to only half a meter rise in sea level.

690,Modes of seawater intrusion during transgressions,"Kooi, H.; Groen, J.; Leijnse, A.","Analytical methods and numerical experiments are used to study salinization of groundwater in response to sea level rise. The system that is studied involves a saturated porous medium with an inclined upper surface. The upper surface is progressively inundated during sea level rise to simulate transgression, the landward migration of the shoreline. Four ""modes"" of seawater intrusion are distinguished: (1) horizontal intrusion for slow transgression and a relatively high-permeability (sand/silt) substrate, (2) vertical intrusion by seawater fingering for fast transgression and a sand/silt substrate, (3) vertical intrusion by diffusion for fast transgression and a low-permeability (clay) substrate, (4) vertical intrusion by combined diffusion and low-salinity fingering for fast transgression and a clay layer at the seafloor overlying an aquifer. These four modes are characterized by the development of very distinctive transition zones between the fresh and salt groundwater domains. An analytical expression is derived for the critical transgression rate which separates horizontal (mode 1) from dominantly vertical (modes 2-4) intrusion. For modes 3 and 4, salinization significantly lags behind sea level rise. The results are consistent with observations of fossil fresh/brackish groundwater beneath many continental shelves and shallow seas.",2000,,Water Resour.

The hydraulic connectivity between confined coastal aquifers and the sea largely controls their response to global sea-level rise. Open aquifer systems have direct hydraulic contact with the sea where they sub crop along the continental slope and base-level history for the aquifer is defined by sea-level history. In these systems, hydraulic heads equilibrate quickly to sea-level change at rates controlled by the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity. Interface movement lags behind the equilibration of the hydraulic heads and is controlled largely by the rate at which freshwater can be flushed from the aquifer through overlying semi-confining units. Interface movement occurs over time periods of tens of thousands of years. In contrast, closed aquifer systems lack direct hydraulic connectivity with the sea, which is controlled by the thickness and permeability of overlying semi-confining layers. During the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene the base-level history for closed aquifer systems underlying the North Sea Basin was defined by the location of rivers and lakes in areas that are now offshore. These aquifers became coastal aquifers during the Holocene when rivers and lakes were inundated by rising sea levels. Salinization of closed aquifer systems may occur due to the downward diffusion of salts through overlying semi-confining layers in the presence of upward freshwater seepage. Aquifers overridden by glaciers respond in a manner that is largely controlled by aquifer transmissivity and geometry. The presence of permafrost inhibits recharge resulting in lower hydraulic heads and a reduction in aquifer fluxes.",2001,,Geol. Soc. Spec.

699,Effects of water transfers projected in the Spanish National Hydrological Plan on the ecology of the lower River Ebro (N.E. Spain) and its delta,"Prat, N.; Ibañez, C.","This paper refers to the effects of projected water transfers, envisaged in the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, on the ecology of the lower River Ebro and its delta. Present management strategies, have resulted in highly eutrophic river water and a salt wedge which runs for more than 30 km upstream from the river mouth and its presence has been recorded during most of the year. Some parts of the delta coast are in regression as most of the inorganic sediments carried by the river are trapped in the dams. This is also leading to the sinking of the deltaic plain because subsidence and eustatic sea level rise are not compensated by new sediments. The high productivity of two bays and the coastal zone adjacent to the delta is related to influx of freshwater from irrigation channels, used in rice cultivation and the river. In the new National Hydrological Plan, a withdrawal of water upstream from the delta of 2012 hm3/year (15% of the mean annual discharge) is planned as well as the construction of 49 new reservoirs, mainly for irrigation purposes. A minimum river flow of 100 m3/s will be established by the Plan. If the plan is carried through, due to the water abstraction, forecasts based on ecological studies in the area predict: (1) increased presence of the salt wedge in the final 18 km of the river with detrimental effects on river fauna and flora; (2) serious threats to aquaculture and fisheries in the bays; (3) reduction of fish and crayfish production in the platform area; (4) further reductions in sediment and freshwater inputs to delta; (5) salinization of fields under cultivation; and (6) detrimental side effects on deltaic ecosystems. © 1995, International Association on Water Quality.

700,Nutrient processing and the development of tidal creek ecosystems,"Dame, R.F.; Gardner, L.R.","The North Inlet marsh-estuarine system encompasses the spectrum of interaction between the ocean and the uplands typical of the southeastern United States. The system is an ebb-dominated, bar-built estuary with good flow connection to the sea and some freshwater input. The North Inlet basin has evolved from a forested, relic, beach-ridge terrain under a regime of slowly rising sea level (2 mm year-1). This mode of development is supported by historic tide gage data. 210Pb dating of sediment cores, the presence of spodic soil horizons and tree roots at shallow depths beneath the marsh surface, and the presence of relic 'cat eye' ponds at the edge of the salt marsh. As sea level rises, the boundary between forest and salt marsh recedes upslope and forest spodosols are gradually transformed into marsh soils by salinization, the deposition and mixing of marine mud into the upper horizons of the forest soil and the accumulation of reduced sulfur via sulfate reduction. As a forest watershed is transformed into a salt-marsh basin, the hydraulic geometry of the original, black-water (fresh) stream increases to accommodate the increasing volumes of tidal discharge. Forest sands move seaward while marine muds are transported into the basin. As water moves between the forest and the sea, it passes through creeks in different developmental stages. Large mature creeks interact with the ocean while young, ephemeral creeks drain the uplands and intertidal marsh zones. Intermediate stage creeks connect these two and are characterized by the presence of oyster reefs. Net nutrient fluxes appear to be different in each developmental stage. The 'Bly Creek' study of Dame and coworkers addressed the flux of materials between a creek at the intermediate stage of development and the adjacent mature system. Material fluxes from a freshwater stream draining into Bly Creek from the adjacent uplands were also observed. The role of the salt marsh and the oyster reefs in determining material fluxes was examined. The Bly Creek basin imports particulate nutrients and exports dissolved forms. The 'Outwelling' study of Dame and coworkers at North Inlet focused on the flux of materials between the mature creeks and the Atlantic Ocean. All constituents were exported seasonally and annually from the estuary, except total sediments (imported during fall and winter) and chlorophyll a (imported in the summer and fall). The export of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was high compared with other estuarine systems. On a unit area basis, primary productivity is higher and nutrient fluxes are lower in Bly Creek (intermediate stage of development) as compared with the mature North Inlet system. These observations support the general ecosystem development hypothesis that nutrient storage and retention are higher in younger systems than more mature systems where growth is lower and fewer nutrients are needed. © 1993.",1993,,Mar.

The second phase of development took place after the Roman occupation and continues to the present day, but again we do not know exactly when it began.

A major Arctic storm event originating in the Beaufort Sea in September 1999 resulted in the flooding of a large area of the outer alluvial plain of the Mackenzie Delta (Northwest Territories, Canada), and has been previously shown to have caused unprecedented impacts on the terrestrial ecosystems on a regional scale. We use diatoms preserved in lake sediment cores to gain a landscape perspective on the impact of the storm on freshwater systems, and to determine if other such events have occurred in the recent past. Our results indicate that five lakes located at the coastal edge of the low-lying Mackenzie Delta show strong, synchronous, and previously unobserved increases in the relative abundance of brackish-water diatom taxa coincident with the timing of the 1999 storm surge. These changes were not observed at a control site located farther inland. The degree to which the storm surge impacted the chemical and biological limnology of the lakes varied, and was not explained by measured physical variables, suggesting the degree of impact is likely related to a combination of factors including distance from the coast, the size:volume ratio of the lake and its catchment, and water residence time. We show that the 1999 storm surge resulted in unmatched broadscale impacts on the freshwater ecosystems of the outer Mackenzie Delta, and that while minimal recovery may be occurring in some of the systems, the lakes studied remain chemically and biologically impacted more than a decade after the inundation event. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012,,Holocene,22,12,1451-1460,,10.1177/0959683612455538,,#16152,Thienpont 2012,,
710,"Storm Surges Cause Simultaneous Salinization and Freshening of Coastal Aquifers, Exacerbated by Climate Change","Paldor, A.; Michael, H.A.","Ocean surge events are known to threaten coastal aquifers through vertical infiltration, with the degree of salinization depending on hydrogeologic factors. Another salinization process in coastal aquifers is lateral saltwater intrusion, which may also be affected during surges as the inundation alters the aquifer hydraulic heads. While these processes have been considered individually, here we consider the interplay between them and the longer-term impact of climate change, which is projected to increase the frequency of surges in the future. Using numerical modeling, the location of the lateral freshwater-saltwater interface and the total salt storage are calculated for single and repetitive surge events with different recurrence times to predict the long-term effect of surges. Results point to two novel mechanisms: (1) Following a single overwash event, salt storage in the aquifer peaks due to vertical salinization, and a second, lower peak occurs on a longer time scale. This second peak is due to the surge-induced rebound motion (seaward and then landward) of the interface. (2) The projected increase in surge frequency due to climate change can potentially induce long-term migration of the interface seaward, independent of a change in sea level, depending on the aquifer permeability. Together with this freshening effect, the total salt load in the aquifer increases due to repetitive vertical salinization. Thus, we show for the first time the combined effect of storm surges and climate change on both vertical and horizontal movement of salt in coastal aquifers, with important implications for water management along global coastlines. © 2021.

In recent years, changes in flood patterns have been observed in the Mekong Delta with erratic fluctuations in the flooded area, especially in the downstream provinces. It causes a lot of difficulties in flood monitoring and management in this area. Therefore, a robust assessment of flood shifting is essential in the Mekong Delta. This work addresses the development of a logical model based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to assess floods in the downstream Mekong River basin. In the present study, the observed data of Tan Chau and Chau Doc hydrological stations have been used to test and prove the reliability of this application. The inundation scenario generated from this study showed a gradual shift in flooding patterns of the downstream provinces of the Mekong Delta. Overall, the flooded area is decreasing; however, the same is increasing in Bac Lieu province. This research will help to construct a professional support system to monitor the flood inundation in the Mekong Delta.

717,Synchronous changes in chironomid assemblages in two Arctic delta lake ecosystems after a major saltwater intrusion event,"Thienpont, J.R.; Steele, C.; Vermaire, J.C.; Pisaric, M.F.J.; Kokelj, S.V.; Smol, J.P.","Low-lying Arctic coastal environments are threatened by marine storm surges, which are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of decreasing sea ice, rising sea levels and altered intensity and frequency of storm activity. The Mackenzie Delta of Canada’s Northwest Territories, a vast, low-lying wetland ecosystem, is particularly susceptible to such storm surges, because much of the outer alluvial plain is below 2-m elevation. A large storm-surge event in September 1999 flooded >13,000 ha of alluvial terrain and impacted the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems of the region. Previous research on the limnological impacts of the storm surge recorded a shift from freshwater to brackish diatom taxa, and a change in cladoceran assemblages to more saline-tolerant species. We examined the remains of Chironomidae (Insecta, Diptera) in sediment cores from two lakes impacted by the 1999 saltwater inundation to determine whether the storm surge also affected benthic macroinvertebrate communities, which are particularly important to lake ecosystem function in Arctic regions. We observed an increase in the relative abundance of saline-tolerant taxa in the two impacted lakes, including Paratanytarsus and Cricotopus/Orthocladius, and decreases in saline-intolerant Sergentia and Corynocera oliveri-type, coincident with the 1999 storm. We observed no major assemblage changes after 1999 in a control lake located beyond the zone of inundation. The number of head capsules recovered from sediments of the impacted lakes increased after the 1999 storm, suggesting no negative impact on overall chironomid abundance as a result of the shift to brackish conditions. There has, however, been no recovery of the chironomid community to the pre-1999 composition. Earlier assemblage changes in both impacted lakes likely tracked regional climate warming in the region, known to have begun in the late nineteenth century. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2015,,J.

This paper analyses the coastal environment of the Mahanadi delta to evaluate the vulnerability profile by assessing its inherent hazards such as ecosystem disruption, gradual coastal inundation, intrusion of salt water into the freshwater aquifers, coastal flooding and beach erosion. The study uses the bio-geophysical parameters such as geomorphological layout, nature of wave exposure, range of tidal amplitude, coastal vegetation, balance and deficit of coastal sediments and presence or absence of storm climate which are also used in assessing hazards of climate change which are inherent to a coastal zone. The model has used remote sensing data from the open sources and a GIS framework to assess the problem from the management perspective. The study has generated data and maps about the degree to which a particular location along the coast is vulnerable to the hazards inherent to the coast dividing the coastline into several morphological segments. The study reveals that the deltaic and pro-grading shoreline of the Mahanadi delta has undergone erosion and accretion in a phased manner with erosion exceeding the rate of accretion. The rate of erosion has varied from 4 m to 15 m per year at different sites along the delta front. The study has generated vulnerability data and maps for the different coastal hazards inherent to the coast, i.e. saltwater intrusion, saline inundation, coastal erosion, flooding, ecosystem disruption and associated risk levels at the regional level for the 279 km of coastline of the delta. The study reveals that 28.6% of Mahanadi delta’s coastline has a very high risk, 47.6% has high risk, 16.99% has moderate risk and 6.81% has a lower risk in respect of different inherent hazards. The study reveals an increasing magnitude of vulnerability to the coastal environment from the inherent hazards than previous assessments by different researchers. The study has also identified a number of possible environmentally adoptable management interventions as a part of its sustainable solutions. The findings of this study are significant in understanding the retardation in the growth of the delta and environmental problems arising out of the inherent hazards of the coastal zone in a deltaic region. The study also suggests the significance of using open-source satellite data and geo-informatics-based CHW and DSAS in assessing the vulnerability of environmental degradation for integrated coastal zone management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Springer Clim.,,,157-178,,10.1007/978-3-031-15501-7_6,,#16182,Mishra 2022,,

720,Cost-effective management measures for coastal aquifers affected by saltwater intrusion and climate change,"Abd-Elaty, I.; Kushwaha, N.L.; Grismer, M.E.; Elbeltagi, A.; Kuriqi, A.","Sustainable management of natural water resources and food security in the face of changing climate conditions is critical to the livelihood of coastal communities. Increasing inundation and saltwater intrusion (SWI) will likely adversely affect agricultural production and the associated beach access for tourism. This study uses an integrated surface-ground water model to introduce a new approach for retardation of SWI that consists of placing aquifer fill materials along the existing shoreline using Coastal Land Reclamation (CLR). The modeling results suggest that the artificial aquifer materials could be designed to decrease SWI by increasing the infiltration area of coastal precipitation, collecting runoffs from the catchment area, and applying treated wastewater or desalinated brackish water-using coastal wave energy to reduce water treatment costs. The SEAWAT model was applied to verify that it correctly addressed Henry's problem and then applied to the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. In this study, to better inform Coastal Aquifer Management (CAM), we developed four modeling scenarios, namely, Physical Surface Barriers (PSB), including the artificial aquifer widths, permeability, and side slopes and recharge. In the base case scenario without artificial aquifer placement, results show that seawater levels would increase aquifer salinity and displace large amounts of presently available fresh groundwater. More specifically, for the Biscayne aquifer, approximately 0.50% of available fresh groundwater will be lost (that is, 41,192 m3) per km of the width of the aquifer considering the increasing seawater level. Furthermore, the results suggest that placing the PSB aquifer with a smaller permeability of <100 m per day at a width of approximately 615 m increases the available fresh groundwater by approximately 45.20 and 43.90% per km of shoreline, respectively. Similarly, decreasing the slope on the aquifer-ocean side and increasing the aquifer recharge will increase freshwater availability by about 43.90 and 44.50% per km of the aquifer. Finally, placing an aquifer fill along the shallow shoreline increases net revenues to the coastal community through increased agricultural production and possibly tourism that offset fill placement and water treatment costs. This study is useful for integrated management of coastal zones by delaying aquifer salinity, protecting fresh groundwater bodies, increasing agricultural lands, supporting surface water supplies by harvesting rainfall and flash flooding, and desalinating saline water using wave energy. Also, the feasibility of freshwater storage and costs for CAM is achieved in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Sci.

723,Modelling Evaluation of Dam Removal in the Context of River Ecosystem Restoration,"Wan, Y.; Sun, D.; Labadie, J.","Applications of environmental models may provide imperative information to enable informed decision-making of river management actions, which are often made in the face of high system complexity and uncertainty. We applied Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System(HEC-RAS) and Curvilinear Hydrodynamics Three-Dimensional (CH3D) models to aid in the decision-making of the proposed removal of the Masten Dam, a small, 'run-of-the-river' dam on the Loxahatchee River, a federally designated 'Wild and Scenic River' in south-east coast of Florida (USA). Anthropogenic alteration of the system has led to changing hydroperiods and salinity regimes in the floodplain. Both models are calibrated against measured data taken at varying temporal and spatial scales. The HEC-RAS modelling results show that removal of the Masten Dam would lower water levels in the upstream riverine reach, leading to reduced soil moisture or inundation in the floodplain. The CH3D modelling results indicate that dam removal would increase river salinity during the dry season in the tidal reach where salinity compliance for environmental flow regulation is measured. These environmental changes would exert additional stress on freshwater vegetation communities in the floodplain. Given the scarcity of water resources in the region, removal of the Masten Dam would not offer an effective restoration strategy. This study demonstrates not only the need for evaluation of dam removal on a case-by-case basis but also the usefulness of environmental models in providing the technical basis for such management decisions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2015,,River Res.

727,"A parametric approach for coastal flood risks assessment by integrating hazard data and micro-level aspects of rural vulnerability: Case of Sagar Island, West Bengal","Narendr, A.; Sharma, P.; Aithal, B.H.","Coastal floods are devastating and life-threatening. This being intensified by the changing climate, rapid population growth, unplanned development. It has a detrimental impact on human habitats and their livelihood, with rural areas suffering the most due to low resilience. Floods were the most commonly occurring natural disasters between 1998 and 2017, causing 142,088 deaths and affecting nearly two-billion people across the globe. Flood mitigation, therefore, appears as a challenging task before the policymakers, technical experts, health organizations, and civil society. Flood risk assessment and mapping is a tool for identifying the vulnerable locations and further helps in minimizing the disaster-effect. The study proposes a parametric approach for flood risk zoning by spatially analyzing flood hazard exposure and corresponding aspects of rural vulnerability from socio-demographic, economic, infrastructure, and accessibility to infrastructure domain. The relative sensitivity of the parameters is evaluated based on the domain knowledge, reclassifying them on a Likert scale of 1 to 5. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making is used to reclassify flood exposure and vulnerability that are later integrated using weighted sum technique. The flood risk zone map is obtained as the product of exposure and vulnerability parameters. The case area chosen for the analysis is for a smaller island in Sundarbans. The results showcase the significant influence of socio-demographic, economic, and accessibility parameters in enhancing coastal flood sensitivity. The risk is highest around the coastal belt and reduces as one shift to the island core. Land use plays a critical role in influencing regional flood risk as to the presence of mangroves prevent coastal inundation and saltwater intrusion. The parameter 'accessibility to infrastructure' is a novel addition in evaluating micro-level flood risk of the island caused due to the uneven resource distribution. The method allows planners and policymakers to prioritize and develop effective strategies for risk reduction in flood-prone areas. Also, the pairwise comparison method has universal application for micro-level spatial operations in a data-scarce environment. The mathematical base of the techniques effectively eases out a complex problem in the path of policymaking. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

734,"Distribution, origin, and resource-management implications of ground-water salinity along the western margin of the Chesapeake Bay impact structure in eastern Virginia","McFarland, E.R.; Bruce, T.S.","Stratified unconsolidated sediments that compose a regionally extensive system of aquifers and confining units beneath the Virginia Coastal Plain contain saltwater approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) landward of its normally expected position along the coast. Part of the Chesapeake Bay impact structure (formed by the collision of a large asteroid or comet) underlies the Virginia Coastal Plain. The impact severely disrupted preexisting sediments, and its effects are still influencing the regional ground-water flow. Geologic and hydrologic evidence indicates that the impact structure contains seawater emplaced during a regional inundation approximately 2 million years ago, along with much older seawater and evaporative brine emplaced potentially as far back as the impact event 35 million years ago. With emergence of the coastal plain and resumption of ground-water recharge during the past 2 million years, freshwater flushing displaced residual seawater across the region but was impeded across the impact structure by the clayey Chickahominy Formation. Flushing took place laterally along the crater outer margin through underlying crater-fill sediments, followed by upward leakage and surface discharge to areas outside of the crater. Saltwater within the impact structure maintained its present position even as flushing outside of the impact structure extended in places nearly to the edge of the continental shelf during the Pleistocene glacial maximum of 18,000 years ago. Sea level has since risen to its present position, and the residual seawater has merged with the modern ocean along an inverted and unstable transition zone along the western margin of the impact structure that separates fresh ground water to the west from saltwater to the east. During the past century, hydraulic gradients have been greatly increased and flow has been redirected landward across regional cones of depression centered on industrial pumping centers located outside of the impact structure. Saltwater intrusion across regional distances from the impact structure has not taken place, however, because most of the ground water now present was emplaced prior to the onset of heavy pumping. Because saltwater within the impact structure maintained its present position for millennia during freshwater flushing prior to pumping, a potentially very long timeframe could be required for regional saltwater intrusion to occur even under present gradients. In contrast, localized saltwater movement along the western margin of the impact structure is possible across relatively short distances because of municipal withdrawals being made from within the saltwater transition zone. Major increases in withdrawal and desalinization of brackish ground water from the transition zone are being projected to address rapidly growing demands for public supplies during the coming several decades. Water-supply planning is challenged, however, by future increases in ground-water salinity that are difficult to estimate because of complex hydrogeologic controls and withdrawal-induced effects within the transition zone. A detailed local-scale characterization of hydrologic conditions along the western margin will be critical to assessment of the potential for saltwater movement.",2006,,US Geol. Surv.

737,Monitoring hurricane effects on aquifer salinity using ALSM,"Starek, M.; Sedighi, A.","During the Atlantic hurricane season of 2004, the Florida Pan Handle, Gulf Coast region, was impacted directly by three hurricanes within approximately a one-month time period. The short temporal span between impacts coupled with the severity of the storms resulted in drastic changes to the littoral zone geomorphology including extensive shoreline erosion and accretion that directly affected the subsurface hydrogeologic environment. The most important direct physical effects of a hurricane are the following: coastal erosion, shoreline inundation owing to higher than normal tide levels plus increased temporary surge levels during storms, and saltwater intrusion primarily into estuaries and groundwater aquifers. Erosion and deposition during the hurricane change the elevation, which causes change in the position of shoreline. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sea level inundation due to the hurricanes on the near shore subsurface freshwater-saltwater interface. By utilizing high-resolution Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM) altimetry data acquired shortly before and after the three major hurricane landfalls, the change in shoreline topography was estimated to determine both small-scale and large-scale horizontal encroachment and volumetric change in shoreline. This information was used to develop a before and after variable density groundwater flow model to determine the impact of the hurricanes on the subsurface saltwater-freshwater interface. SEAWAT (Langevin 2001; Guo and Langevin 2002), which simulates three-dimensional, variable-density groundwater flow following a modular structure similar to MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh 1988), was selected to represent the saltwater-freshwater interface in this investigation.",2006,,Am.

Hydrogeomorphic regimes foster peat formation, resulting in unique biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. Our sites include regimes that are exposed to sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater intrusion, yet other sites are protected by higher elevations. In this study, we evaluated climatic variables to discern differences in tree ring formation as an indicator of growth among nine stands including microtidal, oligohaline sites as well as other protected areas which served as a control. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used, and series were divided into two sub-chronologies, 1895 to 1971 (early) and 1972 to 2018 (recent). AWC growth in response to precipitation parameters, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were largely non-significant but were somewhat reversed among sub-chronologies. Early correlations were primarily negatively correlated with PDSI, while recent correlations were mostly positive, which suggests that even though inundation may reduce photosynthate availability for growth, precipitation has begun to increase growth by alleviating osmotic and toxic stresses associated with seawater. Analysis of climatic variables and tree growth at the reference site found that other anthropogenic stressors associated with ditching exert a greater influence. Hurricane impacts on tree growth exhibited no lasting negative effects; however, an AWC ghost forest report from New Jersey connected mortality to a hurricane. Hydrogeomorphic regimes may delay rather than eliminate risks associated with sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater. © 2021 by the authors.

741,Effect of cut-off wall on freshwater storage in small islands considering ocean surge inundation,"Yang, J.; Graf, T.; Luo, J.; Lu, C.","Freshwater lenses (FWL) underneath islands are often unique freshwater resources. Constructing cut-off walls in coastal islands to increase the FWL size has been proposed and tested effective. Meanwhile, seawater inundation induced by ocean surges on low-lying islands can cause the vertical intrusion of saltwater and salinization of FWL. Constructing cut-off walls can influence the post-inundation recovery once the FWL is salinized during the inundation. This influence has not been investigated and considered when discussing the feasibility of cut-off walls. In this study, we numerically simulated an ocean-surge inundation on a 2D, vertically oriented island constructed with a cut-off wall, using a coupled surface–subsurface approach. We varied the aquifer permeability and the depth of the cut-off wall. The effect of the cut-off wall on FWL was quantitatively assessed in terms of FWL volume and flushing time. The results show that the cut-off wall can significantly increase the volume of FWL, confirming previous studies, especially when it is constructed in high-permeability (>10−10.5 m2) islands and deeper. In addition, the cut-off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40% during the inundation. Therefore, the recovery tends to be accelerated in the early stage, and in islands of low & intermediate permeability. However, the average recovery in high-permeability islands can be slowed down, because the cut-off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is harder for flushing. As a first attempt to assess the feasibility of the cut-off wall construction from the perspective of FWL recovery, our study is important for the management of freshwater on islands facing the risk of ocean-surge inundation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,J.

743,Sea-level rise impacts on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers: Review and integration,"Ketabchi, H.; Mahmoodzadeh, D.; Ataie-Ashtiani, B.; Simmons, C.T.","Sea-level rise (SLR) influences groundwater hydraulics and in particular seawater intrusion (SWI) in many coastal aquifers. The quantification of the combined and relative impacts of influential factors on SWI has not previously been considered in coastal aquifers. In the present study, a systematic review of the available literature on this topic is first provided. Then, the potential remaining challenges are scrutinized. Open questions on the effects of more realistic complexities such as gradual SLR, parameter uncertainties, and the associated influences in decision-making models are issues requiring further investigation.We assess and quantify the seawater toe location under the impacts of SLR in combination with recharge rate variations, land-surface inundation (LSI) due to SLR, aquifer bed slope variation, and changing landward boundary conditions (LWBCs). This is the first study to include all of these factors in a single analysis framework. Both analytical and numerical models are used for these sensitivity assessments. It is demonstrated that (1) LSI caused by SLR has a significant incremental impact on the seawater toe location, especially in the flatter coasts and the flux-controlled (FC) LWBCs, however this impact is less than the reported orders of magnitude differences which were estimated using only analytical solutions; (2) LWBCs significantly influence the SLR impacts under almost all conditions considered in this study; (3) The main controlling factors of seawater toe location are the magnitudes of fresh groundwater discharge to sea and recharge rate. Regional freshwater flux entering from the landward boundary and the groundwater hydraulic gradient are the major contributors of fresh groundwater discharge to sea for both FC and head-controlled (HC) systems, respectively; (4) A larger response of the aquifer and larger seawater toe location changes are demonstrable for a larger ratio of the aquifer thickness to the aquifer length particularly in the HC systems; (5) The lowest sensitivity of seawater toe location is found for the density difference ratio of the seawater and freshwater, and also for the aquifer bed slope; (6) The early-time observations show seawater fingers below the inundated lands due to SLR which are diminished and ultimately extinguished; and (7) A less than 2% reversal effect on the seawater toe location after overshoot mechanism is observed in the transient simulations which suggests that this mechanism is an insignificant and impractical factor compared to other more significant factors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,,J.

Most of the recent generalized analyses of SWI under SLR neglect land-surface inundation (LSI) by seawater. A simple analytical method is applied to quantitatively assess the influence and importance of LSI on SLR-SWI problems under idealized conditions. The results demonstrate that LSI induces significantly more extensive SWI, with inland penetration up to an order of magnitude larger in the worst case, compared to the effects of pressure changes at the shoreline in unconfined coastal aquifers with realistic parameters. The study also outlines some of the remaining research challenges in related areas, concluding that LSI impacts are among other important research questions regarding the SLR-SWI problems that have not been addressed, including the effects of aquifer heterogeneities, real-world three dimensionality, and mitigation measures. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,,Hydrogeol.

Many real cases of atoll or sandy islands involve two-layer hydrogeological conceptualizations. In this paper, the influential factors that affect FGLs in two-layer small islands subject to SLR are investigated. An analytical solution describing FGLs in circular islands, composed of two geological layers, is developed for the simplified case of steady-state and sharp-interface conditions. An application of the developed model is demonstrated to estimate the FGL thickness of some real-world islands by comparison with existing FGL thickness data. Furthermore, numerical modelling is applied to extend the analysis to consider dispersion effects and to confirm comparable results for both cases. Sensitivity analyses are used to assess the importance of land-surface inundation caused by SLR, relative to other parameters (i.e. thickness of aquifer layers, hydraulic conductivity, recharge rate and land-surface slope) that influence the FGL. Dimensionless parameters are used to generalize the findings. The results demonstrate that land-surface inundation has a considerable impact on a FGL influenced by SLR, as expected, although the FGL volume is more sensitive to recharge, aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity than SLR impacts, considering typical parameter ranges.

757,Abundance and speciation of iron across a subtropical tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea,"Luo, M.; Zeng, C.-S.; Tong, C.; Huang, J.-F.; Yu, Q.; Guo, Y.-B.; Wang, S.-H.","To examine the abundance and speciation of iron, six iron species (poor crystalline Fe(III), crystalline Fe(III), non-sulfidic Fe(II), porewater Fe2+, FeS, and FeS2) were investigated in a cross transect (span=250m, depth=~1.2m) in a tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea. The results suggested that sediment characteristics, pH, redox condition, conductivity, chloride, sulfate, and organic matter create a highly heterogeneous geochemical framework in the cross transect. Correspondingly, the zonation of iron species differed significantly across the tidal marsh. Poor crystalline Fe(III) (48±24μmolg-1) and crystalline Fe(III) (75±32μmolg-1) accumulated on the surface of the high-tide zone and decreased with elevation. The non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals (140±61μmolg-1) accounted for the largest proportion of the six iron species. The porewater Fe2+ was enriched within the deep layer of the upland region (pH=6.2-6.5) and exhibited a maximum of 11.49mM. The aqueous sulfide concentration was below detection. FeS (39±6μmolg-1) and FeS2 (57±25μmolg-1) accumulated closer to the lower extremity. Tidal water brought O2 and removed certain amounts of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and Fe(III)-bearing particles in an element budget during tidal inundation. Variations of topography, tidal hydrology, seawater intrusion, and organic matter altered the dominant organic matter oxidation pathway and further affected iron mineralization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,,Appl.

758,Influence of aquifer heterogeneity on sea level rise-induced seawater intrusion: A probabilistic approach,"Ketabchi, H.; Jahangir, M.S.","Seawater intrusion (SWI) is influenced by a variety of coastal phenomena, such as sea level rise (SLR), inundation of low-lying coastal regions, coastal storms, recharge rate variations, and pumping-induced saltwater upconing. Quantification of the influence of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field on SWI combined with SLR, land-surface inundation, and recharge rate variations in an unconfined aquifer is the main objective of the present study. The principal SWI indicators used in this study are length of the SWI wedge, seawater volume, and weighted average transition zone width. Characterized by the hydraulic conductivity field variance (σlnk2), the longitudinal correlation length (λx), the type of SLR (gradual or instantaneous SLR), the land-surface inundation consideration, and the recharge rate variations, 72 scenarios have been introduced, and for each of them, 50 sets of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields have been generated. Based on two approaches, namely ensemble Monte-Carlo and a Bayesian framework, it is demonstrated that: (1) the land-surface inundation consideration increases the SWI wedge length and the seawater volume regardless of the type of SLR, while it decreases the weighted average transition zone width in gradual SLR scenarios; (2) λx has a more significant impact on SWI characteristics compared to σlnk2; (3) increasing the degree of aquifer heterogeneity results in larger effective dispersion values; (4) Numerical bootstrapping suggests that the introduced Bayesian framework could be adopted as an alternative to computationally demanding methods such as bootstrapping for stochastic analysis of SWI; (5) Reliability analysis indicates the general belief that considering the heterogeneity decreases the SWI wedge length and the seawater volume, while increases the transition zone width compared to the homogeneous modeling is associated with huge amounts of uncertainty proportional to the aquifer heterogeneity itself; and (6) the results show that the impact of heterogeneity on the SWI indicators is similar under different recharge rates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,J.

761,Coastal Disasters and Mitigation Measures,"Neelamani, S.","The increased population density in the coastal areas has made the coast more vulnerable for disaster and for sustainable development of coastal infrastructures. With increase in greenhouse gas emission, global warming, accelerated melting of polar ice and sea level rise, the vulnerability for coastal disaster is expected to magnify in the future. The global average temperature of the air is expected to increase anywhere from 2 to 6 degree C by 2100, depends on the pathway of greenhouse gas emission and the sea level is expected to rise from 0.5 to 1.0 m by 2100. This would create permanent inundation of the coastal area and the associated degradation and damage of coastal infrastructures. It is expected that the intensity and frequency of cyclone activities would increase, which would accelerate coastal erosion. It is expected that many ground water resources in coastal cities will face more seawater intrusion problems. The seawater acidification would increase with accelerated bleaching of coral reefs and deterioration of mangroves. The increase in construction of dams across rivers would reduce the sediment flow from river to sea, which will fuel the coastal erosion issues. A clear understanding of all these issues are very important and suitable mitigation measures need to be adopted. Do nothing/defend/adopt and retrieve are important management frameworks to take care of the future coastal disasters. Reduce/reuse and recycle are other important frameworks to be followed by stakeholders.

767,Seawater intrusion vulnerability indicators for freshwater lenses in strip islands,"Morgan, L.K.; Werner, A.D.","Freshwater lenses on small islands are some of the most vulnerable aquifer systems in the world. However, there is currently little guidance on methods for rapidly assessing the vulnerability of freshwater lenses to the potential effects of climate change. We address this gap using a simple steady-state analytic modelling approach to develop seawater intrusion (SWI) vulnerability indicator equations, which quantify the propensity for SWI to occur in strip islands due to recharge change and sea-level rise (SLR) (incorporating the effect of land surface inundation (LSI)). The following inferences about SWI vulnerability in freshwater lenses can be made from the analysis: (1) SWI vulnerability indicators for SLR (under flux-controlled conditions) are proportional to lens thickness (or volume) and the rate of LSI and inversely proportional to island width; (2) SWI vulnerability indicators for recharge change (under flux-controlled conditions) are proportional to lens thickness (or volume) and inversely proportional to recharge; and (3) SLR has greater impact under head-controlled conditions rather than flux-controlled conditions, whereas the opposite is the case for LSI and recharge change. Example applications to several case studies illustrate use of the method for rapidly ranking lenses according to vulnerability, thereby allowing for prioritisation of areas where further and more detailed SWI investigations may be required. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,,J.

Combined with the prospect of sea-level rise and the reliance of many people on these resources, this demonstrates the need to assess the vulnerability of coastal areas to these threats. In this study, we investigated the impact of tides and storm surges on coastal groundwater at a pilot location on the Dutch coast (viz., the Sand Engine). To monitor changes in groundwater salinity under a variety of conditions, we performed automated measurements with electrical resistivity tomography for a period of 2 months between November 2014 and January 2015. The obtained resistivity images were converted to salinity images, and these images served effectively as observations of the impact of tidal fluctuations, saltwater overwash during storm surges, and the recovery of the freshwater lens after land-surface inundations. Most of the observed changes in groundwater head and salinity could be reproduced with a two-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport model. This shows that groundwater models can be used to make accurate predictions of the impact of tides and storm surges on fresh groundwater resources, given a thorough understanding of the (local) system. Comparisons of measurements and model simulations also showed that morphological changes and wave run-up can have a strong impact on the extent of land-surface inundations in (low-elevation) dynamic coastal environments, and can therefore substantially affect coastal fresh groundwater resources. © 2017.

778,"Understanding the Impacts of Climate Change: an Analysis of Inundation, Marsh Elevation, and Plant Communities in a Tidal Freshwater Marsh","Delgado, P.; Hensel, P.; Baldwin, A.","Tidal freshwater marshes around the world face an uncertain future with increasing water levels, salinity intrusion, and temperature and precipitation shifts associated with climate change. Due to the characteristic abundance of both annual and perennial species in these habitats, even small increases in early growing season water levels may reduce seed germination, seedling establishment, and late-season plant cover, decreasing overall species abundance and productivity. This study looks at the distribution of tidal freshwater marsh plant species at Jug Bay, Patuxent River (Chesapeake Bay, USA), with respect to intertidal elevation, and the relationship between inundation early in the growing season and peak plant cover to better understand the potential impacts and marsh responses to increased inundation. Results show that 62% of marsh plant species are distributed at elevations around mean high water and are characterized by narrow elevation ranges in contrast with species growing at lower elevations. In addition, the frequency and duration of inundation and water depth to which the marsh was exposed to, prior to the growing season (March 15–May 15), negatively affected peak plant cover (measured in end-June to mid-July) after a threshold value was reached. For example, 36 and 55% decreases in peak plant cover were observed after duration of inundation threshold values of 25 and 36% was reached for annual and perennial species, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that plant communities of tidal freshwater marshes are sensitive to even small systematic changes in inundation, which may affect species abundance and richness as well as overall wetland resiliency to climate change. © 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",2018,,Estuar.

780,"Impacts of Storm Surge Barriers on Drag, Mixing, and Exchange Flow in a Partially Mixed Estuary","Ralston, D.K.","Storm surge barriers are increasingly being considered as risk mitigation measures for coastal population centers. During non-storm periods, permanent barrier infrastructure reduces the flow cross-sectional area and affects tidal exchange. Effects of barrier structures on estuarine tidal and salinity dynamics have not been extensively examined, particularly for partially mixed estuaries. A nested, high-resolution model is used to characterize impacts of a potential storm surge barrier near the mouth of the Hudson River estuary. Maximum tidal velocities through barrier openings are more than double those in the base case. Landward of the barrier, tidal amplitude decreases on average by about 6% due to increased drag. The drag coefficient with the barrier is about 5 times greater than the base case due primarily to form drag from flow separation at barrier structures rather than increased bottom friction. The form drag scales with barrier geometry similar to previous studies of flow around headlands. Tidal water levels are reduced particularly during spring tides, such that marsh inundation frequency is reduced up to 25%. Strong tidal velocities through barrier openings enhance salinity mixing locally, but overall mixing in the estuary decreases due to reduced tidal velocities. Correspondingly, stratification decreases near the barrier and increases landward in the estuary. The salinity intrusion length increases by 5%–15% depending on discharge due to the decreased mixing and increased exchange flow. Exchange flow increases near the barrier due reflux into the lower layer with the increased mixing, which has the potential to increase estuarine residence times. © 2022. American Geophysical Union.

783,Impacts of soft soil compaction and groundwater extraction on subsidence in the Yellow River Delta,"Zhang, Y.; Huang, H.; Liu, Y.; Bi, H.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, K.; Yan, L.","Recently, many of the world’s major river deltas have been sinking, making them increasingly vulnerable to floods and storm surges, salinization and permanent inundation. For the Yellow River delta, annual subsidence rates of several to dozens of centimeters have been reported in the past few years. The extraction of a considerable amount of groundwater due to continuous pumping is suggested as the main driver of the groundwater depression cone. Despite its scale and severity, methods to quantify subsidence are scarce. We introduce a soil mechanics approach to quantify subsidence due to the compaction of soft soil. The largest reduction in soft soil thickness, which is more than 2.6 m, occurred in the salt field area to the north of the Yellow River. Furthermore, by estimating the primary consolidation of soft soil, the subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation is quantified. In the coastal area of the delta, due to excessive exploitation of shallow underground brine resources, the maximum accumulated subsidence is as high as 2 m. Since the natural consolidation of these deltaic sediments has ended, if the current groundwater exploitation intensity is maintained, major subsidence disasters, such as subsidence depressions and ground fissures, will occur. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,,Mar.

This paper reviews the potential impacts of climate change over the coming decades in the Pacific island-economies to identify measures for minimizing or mitigating these impacts. Drawing on the downscaling results of Global Climate Models (GCMs), the paper summarizes climate change effects such as changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, and sea levels. Assessment of GCMs suggests that sea level increases are likely to be substantially higher than previously accepted estimates, posing risks of inundation and salinization of freshwater in the Pacific island countries. Crop growth models suggest the potential for substantial losses of agricultural yields, while fisheries models predict changes to catches, and other modeling efforts identify substantial consequences for health and tourism. Integrated Assessment Models indicate the substantial total economic losses, if the business-as-usual growth strategy is followed.

It is shown that the spatial variability of soils is most pronounced in the coastal zone of the Terek-Kuma Lowland subjected to periodical inundation, waterlogging, and drying because of fluctuations in the Caspian Sea level and arid climate. The zone of interaction between underwater and terrestrial pedogenesis is formed under the impact of short-term (surges) and long-term (cyclic fluctuations with a period of up to 100 years) processes. During surges, the soils of the coastal zone acquire the initial pedogenic features related to the mineralization of organic remains, salt accumulation, and the formation of stratified soil profiles. Long-term cycles cause further differentiation of the vertical soil profile into horizons and enhance the spatial diversity of soils with respect to their salinity and alkalinity.

Therefore, the current study presents a novel model to map coastal flooding potential zones due to tsunami wave run-up in Nekor bay using three natural parameters (distance from coastline, altitude and slope) in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Furthermore, the coastal flooding simulation using 4 scénarios (1, 2, 3, 4m) based on the run-up elevation according to tsunami wave elevation (TWE) literature of the study area is used to confirm the DAS model result, and to estimate the potential impacts. The result of the DAS model revealed that 1 km from the coast to the Nekor plain is the most exposed to the impact of tsunamis generated south of the Alboran Sea. The coastal flooding simulation confirmed the DAS result, and the damage estimation of the urban area and the agriculture was respectively 2 and 98% for run-up 1 m, 3% and 97% for run-up 2m, 4% and 96% for run-up 3m, and for the worst case scenario of 4 m was 3% and 97%. Therefore, the results obtained show that the major potential impact of coastal flooding in Nekor plain is the salinization of agricultural land.

Simulations with this model showed that the detailed incorporation of both the local hydro- A nd morphodynamics and the actual recharge rate can result in a reliable reconstruction of the growth in fresh groundwater resources. In contrast, the neglect of tidal dynamics, land-surface inundations, and morphological changes in model simulations can result in considerable overestimations of the volume of fresh groundwater.

796,"Morphotectonic controls of groundwater flow regime and relating environmental impacts in Northwest Sinai, Egypt","El-Rayes, A.E.; Arnous, M.O.; Aziz, A.M.","The frequent appearance of some hydro-environmental hazard features, such as waterlogging and soil salinization along the susceptible zones at Northwest Sinai area (NWSA), has put serious challenges and obstacles for a correct and efficient land use planning of this region, for several decades. Although previous studies have shown that the whole region of Northern Sinai is greatly affected by the tectonic movements associated with the Syrian Arc folding system (SAS), NWSA is barren of any obvious surficial structures. The current work aims to investigate the effect of subsurface tectonic features on the hydrogeologic regime of NWSA. Hydrogeological and remote sensing data were integrated with ground geophysical gravity and magnetic measurements, using the geographic information system. Data integration asserts the role played by buried tectonic features not only in governing the landforms of the upper water-bearing quaternary formations but also in controlling their flow regime. Two major subsurface structures were identified through interpreting the geophysical measurements. A buried dome-like structure, dominating the central part of the mapped area, coincides with the radial flow pattern observed on the water table map. At the southwestern corner of the study area, an elevated groundwater level, caused by continuous groundwater accumulation at the discharge boundary, is superimposing a subsurface block-faulted depression. The waterlogging features (saturation of the soil by groundwater and inundation of local depressions due to rising of water table) dominating the discharge lowlands of NWSA support the conclusion that a buried block-faulted structure exerts a strong influence on the thickness and groundwater flow regime of the shallow quaternary aquifer. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",2017,,Arab.

800,Effect of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation,"Yu, X.; Xin, P.; Hong, L.","Ocean surge inundation occurs frequently in low-lying coastal areas worldwide. While studies have been conducted to examine aquifer salinization and recovery caused by ocean surge inundation, evaporation is predominantly overlooked. Based on numerical simulations considering variably saturated, density-dependent pore-water flow and salt transport, this study examines the combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization in coastal unconfined aquifers. The results show that evaporation enhances soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation. Due to evaporation-induced water uptake, the downward movement of salt is weakened and the salt from the ocean surge inundation is significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone. The pore-water salinity in the shallow soil layer is increased by soil evaporation, particularly in the low-elevation area with longer seawater inundation. The sensitive analysis shows that the evaporation-enhanced soil salinization is more remarkable for silt-loam and clay-loam aquifers rather than sandy-loam aquifers. A higher mean sea level favors salt trapping in the shallow soil layer of aquifers. These results demonstrate the importance of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation, and that could be considered in future studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,,J.

This is also being exacerbated by climate change through increases in sea level and tropical storm surges. One consequence of this has been a widespread introduction of salt water shrimp farming. Here, we show, using field data and modeling, how changes in climate and land use are likely to result in increased salinization of shallow groundwater in SE Asian mega-deltas. We also explore possible adaptation options. We find that possible future increase of episodic inundation events, combined with salt water shrimp farming, will cause rapid salinization of groundwater in the region making it less suitable for drinking water and irrigation. However, modified land use and water management practices can mitigate the impacts on groundwater, as well as the overlying soil, from future salinization.

809,Numerical investigation of coupled density-driven flow and hydrochemical processes in coastal aquifers influenced by storm surges,"Sun, Q.; Gao, M.; Wen, Z.; Hou, G.; Dang, X.; Zhao, G.","Storm surges can result in significant damage to coastal aquifers. Studies have investigated groundwater salinization caused by storm surge inundation. However, the phenomenon of evaporation-driven mineral precipitation in saltwater lakes has not received much attention in the literature. To address this gap, this study simulated the impact of saltwater lakes formed after a storm surge on coastal aquifers by coupling the PHREEQC and SEAWAT models. Six scenarios were considered, with varying lake depth, area, evaporation rate and vertical hydraulic conductivity of lakebed. The results indicate that the total dissolved solids (TDS) and water level of saltwater lake are subject to constant changes due to evaporation. Scenario 2, with the smallest lake area exhibited the least susceptibility to evaporation, with a maximum TDS concentration in the lake of ∼86 g/L, and only dolomite and calcite reached saturation. However, infiltration of saline water into the aquifer was higher than for the other scenarios. A comparing of scenarios with different vertical hydraulic conductivities of lakebed (scenarios 5 and 6 have conductivities that are 0.1 × and 0.01 × that of scenario 1, respectively) shows that a smaller vertical hydraulic conductivity leads to less saline infiltration into the aquifer, but a greater amount of salt precipitates (precipitation ratios of 1.03%, 1.92%, and 5.73% for scenario 1, 5 and 6, respectively). The results of scenario 4, which has double the evaporation rate of the other scenarios, indicate that evaporation leads to significantly greater salt precipitation and a corresponding decrease in the amount of salt that enters the aquifer. The results of secondary salinization indicate that salt precipitated on the surface may infiltrate the aquifer through rainfall dissolution, causing groundwater to become saline again. These findings emphasize the importance of accounting for the impact of evaporation on saltwater lake dynamics and coastal groundwater salinization in future studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Cont.

812,Physico-chemical effects on collapse behaviour of compacted red soil,"Thyagaraj, T.; Das, A.P.","Physico-chemical effects assume significance in geoenvironmental engineering applications where compacted soils and natural soil deposits interact with chemical contaminants. The physico-chemical interactions occur at the microstructural level and affect the macrostructure and thus the volume change behaviour. This paper brings out the physico-chemical effects on the compressibility and collapse behaviour of compacted red soil. The physico-chemical effects were induced by using different fluids for specimen preparation and inundation. Salinisation of compacted specimens prepared with distilled water induces outward osmotic flow and causes induced osmotic consolidation. In addition, the diffusion of saline solutions into the compacted specimens leads to microstructural contractions at the clay particle level and results in an increase in the irreversible macrostructural strains. Consequently, the macrostructure experiences plastic hardening and this results in greater collapse strains. Scanning electron micrographs showed an increase in the size of macrovoids (loose macrostructure) with the increase in pore fluid osmotic suction owing to the microstructural contractions. Therefore, this paper also provides an insight into the behaviour of specimens prepared with saline solutions with respect to the initial loading–collapse (LC) curves and collapse behaviour when subjected to inward osmotic flow and no osmotic flow conditions. The specimens prepared with saline solutions yielded at lower vertical stress in comparison with the specimens prepared with distilled water, and the elastic response of the compacted soil was found to be independent of both matric and pore fluid osmotic suctions.

Subsequently, seawater infiltrates into coastal aquifers and threatens the fresh groundwater resource. The severity of resulting salinization can be affected by hydrogeological factors including aquifer properties and hydrologic conditions, however, little research has been done to assess these effects. To understand the impacts of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization, we numerically simulated an ocean-surge inundation event on a two-dimensional conceptual coastal aquifer using a coupled surface-subsurface approach. We varied model permeability (including anisotropy), inland hydraulic gradient, and recharge rate. Three salinization-assessment indicators were developed, based on flushing time, depth of salt penetration, and a combination of the two, weighted flushing time, with which the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater vulnerability to salinization were quantitatively assessed. The vulnerability of coastal aquifers increases with increasing isotropic permeability. Low horizontal permeability (kx) and high vertical permeability (kz) lead to high aquifer vulnerability, and high kx and low kz lead to low aquifer vulnerability. Vulnerability decreases with increasing groundwater hydraulic gradient and increasing recharge rate. Additionally, coastal aquifers with a low recharge rate (R ≤ 300 mm yr−1) may be highly vulnerable to ocean-surge inundation. This study shows how the newly introduced indicators can be used to quantitatively assess coastal aquifer vulnerability. The results are important for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers to ocean-surge inundation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Adv.

822,Salt Transport Under Tide and Evaporation in a Subtropical Wetland: Field Monitoring and Numerical Simulation,"Liu, Y.; Zhang, C.; Liu, X.; Li, C.; Sheuermann, A.; Xin, P.; Li, L.; Lockington, D.A.","Tidal wetland ecosystems are sensitive to porewater salinity dynamics. However, it is unclear how salts move and distribute in these wetlands, particularly how the salts accumulated by evaporation get removed from the wetland soil, so that the salinity levels may stabilize to accommodate vegetation. We conducted a combined field and modeling study to identify the porewater flow and salinity patterns in a subtropical wetland subjected to tidal inundation and evaporation. Measured and simulated salinity contours indicated the formation of hypersaline porewater plumes in the upper intertidal zone and the fresher porewater zones with salinity close to that of seawater near the creek and in the supratidal zone. Simulations indicated the discharge of the hypersaline upper intertidal porewater to the creek with a discharge pathway developed under the fresher near-creek porewater zone, and this was further confirmed by the field-observed significant salinity gradient under the creek. Our model suggested that both water and salt discharge from the wetland soil occurred predominantly at the creek bank and creek bed. The porewater discharge is more intensive through the creek bank than the creek bed, while the salt discharge across both the creek bank and creek bed was comparable due to the much higher salinity level under the creek bed. Salt discharge driven by density gradients and tidal-induced porewater circulation provides a mechanism for removing salts accumulated in the upper intertidal zone due to evaporation and could prevent salt flat formation and marsh plants dieback. © 2022.

831,Floodwater infiltration through root channels on a sodic clay floodplain and the influence on a local tree species Eucalyptus largiflorens,"Bramley, H.; Hutson, J.; Tyerman, S.D.","Dieback of riparian species on floodplains has been attributed to increased soil salinisation due to raised groundwater levels, resulting from irrigation and river regulation. This is exacerbated by a reduction in flooding frequency and duration of inundation. For the Chowilla floodplain on the River Murray raised water tables have increased the amount of salts mobilised in the soil profile, causing the trees to experience salt induced water stress. For the trees to survive in the long term, salts need to be leached from the root zone. This study investigated whether floodwater infiltrates through channels created by E. largiflorens (black box) roots, flushing salts away from roots, thereby allowing the trees to increase their water uptake. Trees at different sites on the floodplain were artificially flooded, by pumping 1.5 kL of creek water into impoundments constructed around the trees. Gas exchange parameters, and pre-dawn and midday water potential were measured the day before, the day after and one week after the artificial flood and compared against trees that were not flooded. Pre-dawn and midday water potentials were also measured one month after the flood. After flooding, the trees experienced less water stress, indicated by an increase in water potential of less than 0.2 MPa, in comparison to non-flooded control trees. However, this response was not evident one month after flooding. The response to flooding did not result in increased rates of transpiration, stomatal conductance or photosynthesis, even though flooding effectively doubled the trees yearly water supply. The infiltration of floodwater in the impoundments around E. largiflorens was also compared to that of impoundments on bare ground. Floodwater infiltrated 2 - 17 times faster around trees than on adjacent bare ground, for parts of the floodplain not grazed by livestock. Tracer dye experiments indicated that bulk flow of water through pores down the profile was the reason for the enhanced infiltration. Flooding leached salts in direct vicinity of tree roots, but only leached small amounts of salts from the bulk soil.",2003,,Plant Soil,253,1,275-286,,10.1023/A:1024531325281,,#16426,Bramley 2003,,

Burning of fossil fuels, and changes in land use and land cover, increase atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and other radioactive waste that have a warming effect on the atmosphere. Greenhouse emissions play a significant part in global warming (or climate change) with serious socioeconomic implications. Global warming affects agriculture. water resources, fishing, energy supply, transportation, manufacturing and construction. Climate change, resulting in a rise in the sea level could lead to damage and losses due to erosion, inundation, devegetation, and an increase in salinization of surface and ground water. To address these adverse economic effects of climate change (or global warming). some strategies are suggested to reduce the production of greenhouse gases. In the energy sector, it is suggested government should continue to impose a tax on companies for gas flaring. Other strategies suggested include awareness programmes, establishment of carbon reservoirs and the encouragement of efficient of energy in household and industrial equipment. © 1999, Nigerian Economic Society.

Although the rise and fall in the sea water level has been recognized as a periodic phenomenon (every about 40 years), the recent rise created several environmental problems including destruction of buildings, inundation of lowlands and intrusion of saline sea water into and on the productive agricultural lands. The measured average electrical conductivity of the sea water is about 20 dS/m and its rise and intrusion affected the rivers and existing drainage canals for about 2 Kilometers off-shore. The traditional rice fields are in danger of severe salinization now.

845,Salinisation and prospects for biodiversity in rivers and wetlands of south-west Western Australia,"Halse, S.A.; Ruprecht, J.K.; Pinder, A.M.","Saline water was common in south-west Western Australian aquatic systems prior to land-clearing because most streams and wetlands were ephemeral and evapo-concentrated as they dried, and there were high concentrations of stored salt in groundwater and soil profiles. Nevertheless, a 1998 review of salinity trends in rivers of south-west Western Australia showed that 20-fold increases in salinity concentrations had occurred since clearing in the medium-rainfall zone (300-700 mm). More recent data confirm these trends and show that elevated salinities have already caused substantial changes to the biological communities of aquatic ecosystems. Further substantial changes will occur, despite the flora and fauna of the south-west being comparatively well adapted to the presence of salinity in the landscape. Up to one-third of wetland and river invertebrate species, large numbers of plants and a substantial proportion of the waterbird fauna will disappear from the wheatbelt, a region that has high biodiversity value and endemism.

The following set of natural objects was used: seismic foci, zones of primary mercuric deposit, springs, highly moistened zones, area of intensive and exceptionally intensive rock fracturing. Areas of exceptionally intensive rock fracturing and highly moistures zones have the highest levels of association with accumulation zones. This fact test testifies that within accumulation zones abnormal moisture content of soils and ground is controlled by both accumulation of surface and subsurface water flow, and rising migration of deep horizon water. We study processes of migration and accumulation of water which filtered from the North-Crimea Canal, and a role of this canal as a geochemical barrier.

858,Climate-Resilient Biogeochemical Cover for Waste Containment Systems,"Chetri, J.K.; Reddy, K.R.","The waste containment systems which form an important part of the waste management and environmental protection strategies are highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme climatic events and are prone to causing colossal and long-term damage to environment upon failure. For example, the extreme precipitation may reduce the infiltration resistance of landfill cover systems causing seepage of toxic leachate into the subsurface and surrounding environment. Similarly, extreme drought events may lead to drying up of the landfill cover giving rise to formation of cracks and ultimately releases of the harmful landfill gas in undesirable amounts. Hence, there is an urgent need to analyze the vulnerability of the waste containment systems and incorporate resilient designs to adapt to extreme climatic events. Toward this goal, this study presents development of a sustainable cover system for municipal solid waste landfills with primary goal to mitigate methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide from fugitive landfill gas that can also adapt to the impacts of changing climate and extreme weather events such as flooding, erosion, drought, saltwater intrusion, and high temperatures. The proposed cover, also called biogeochemical cover, uses sustainable materials such as biochar-amended soil and steel slag. A comprehensive experimental study evaluated the resilience of the biogeochemical cover system under selected extreme climatic conditions. In particular, the methane oxidation potential and microbial community response were evaluated in detail under widely varying moisture (0%-40% w/w), and temperature (5°C-70°C) conditions. The results demonstrated that the extreme environmental conditions such as high temperature (70°C) and wetting (moisture content >30%) impact the performance of the cover components mainly the biologic component. Nevertheless, the proposed cover components showed satisfactory performance under diverse climatic conditions showing greater resiliency to extreme events. However, the same needs to be further researched in detail under field conditions to verify the resiliency of the proposed cover system. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Such extreme climate events may have long-lasting impact on more sessile organisms, such as unionid freshwater mussels, which are highly imperiled. The objective of our study was to test specific predictions for the impact of an extreme drought in 2011/2012, extreme flooding in 2017, and long-term changes by comparing recent and historical mussel community data from an understudied yet biodiverse region of Texas, USA. Drought had the most detrimental impact leading to community-wide declines, indicated by a significant decline of abundances, species richness and occupied sites. Flooding led to shifts in community composition and spatial distribution. Both severe declines and a distinct community shift occurred over the long-term, where the dominance of species shifted to those more tolerable of disturbance. Saltwater intrusion likely caused a significant increase post-flood of a species known to be tolerant of brackish water (Glebula rotundata). The impact of flooding was likely buffered by connectivity with extensive backwater areas, forming large wetlands, which may act as crucial refuges for mussels during extreme climatic events. Thus, protecting wetlands is crucial to protect freshwater mussels and the ecosystem services they provide. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Hydrobiologia,850,6,1427-1442,,10.1007/s10750-022-04819-7,,#16507,Tarter 2023,,

This study investigates the situational factors affecting the consequences on coastal livelihoods, and social activities; it also considers the effectiveness of traditional knowledge in reducing possible risks. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed, including questionnaire survey for identifying the local perception of climatic impacts alongside the impacts on daily activities. Interviews, field observations, and multivariate analyses were performed to explain the vulnerability status in coastal communities. Results show that most livelihood sectors were severely affected by the long-term and repeated actions of climatic hazards, such as cyclones, associated with a number of unavoidable risks making people susceptible to damages in social wellbeing. In addition, saltwater intrusion damages drinking water supply and crop farming, which can cause diseases among coastal communities, but very few attempts have been made to provide alternative sources of drinking water at a household level. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) revealed significant interfaces between local perceptions and the socio-and agro-environmental factors changing the overall status of regional hazards. Thus, the situation exhibits coastal hazards, social vulnerability, and social crisis. Local people use their traditional knowledge to cope with various levels of crisis under vulnerable conditions, but sometimes doing so exceeds their capacity owing to the unwanted changes in climatic variables and knowledge gaps or uncertainties. Challenges on the basis of the problematic points should be noted, however, it would be more significant to achieve social sustainability under adverse climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,J.

Hurricanes have the potential to alter water balances, causing extensive flooding, biogeo-chemical cycle disruption, and water quality degradation, saltwater intrusion, and increased nutrient sedimentation export in coastal watersheds. This case study focused on Hurricane Michael, a recent catastrophic event that impacted the Gulf coast, the Florida panhandle, southwestern Geor-gia, and southeastern Alabama. Through empirical (Double Mass Curve) and process‐based ecohy-drological modeling (WaSSI model) on long‐term streamflow data, we explored whether vegetation damage caused by this hurricane resulted in an increase in streamflow two years after the extreme event. We found that monthly streamflow from the Chipola River watershed with an area of 2023 km2 did not change (<6%) appreciably during the first two years following the storm, arguably be-cause only a fraction of the gauged watershed lost substantial tree cover. However, spatially explicit hydrological modeling suggested that several sub‐watersheds with the highest decreases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) significantly increased their monthly streamflow in 2019 by up to 22%. These modeled streamflow anomalies subsided by the second growing season when vegetation recovered. Overall, this study suggests that changes in vegetation cover after Hurricane Michael did not have lasting impacts on the hydrology of this watershed, and the hydrology of coastal watersheds may be more resilient to hurricane disturbances than previously thought. © 2022 by the author.

A high-density, fixed array of receivers provided detailed spatial and temporal resolution of behaviour in the second year of study. Smolt migration in the river occurred mostly at night and downstream migration was slower during the day. In the estuary, smolt moved seaward on ebbing tides and landward on flooding tides. The effect of current velocity was greater during the night than during the day. We documented for the first time that current velocity and diurnal period only accounted for approximately one-third of the variation in smolt ground speeds in the estuary, indicating that smolt movements were far less passive than previously reported. Smolt energetic status had no effect on smolt swimming behaviour or migratory performance. With an increase in salinity, smolt seaward movements during flooding tides were more frequent, and overall seaward ground velocity increased. The increase in salinity experienced by the smolt during their migration through the leading edge of saltwater intrusion thus induced a behavioural transition from a more passive, fluvial migration to a more active- and seaward-oriented migration. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",2009,,Ecol.

887,Introduction,"Parker, A.; Grossman, Z.","Indigenous nations are on the frontline of the climate crisis, around the continent and the world. Native peoples are the first to experience climate change, and the peoples who feel it the deepest, with economies and cultures that are the most vulnerable to climate-related catastrophes. Native nations of the Arctic and Subarctic are already feeling catastrophic effects of warmer temperatures in the melting of sea ice, permafrost, and glaciers, and an increase in fires, insects, flooding, and drought patterns. South Pacific Indigenous peoples are finding their islands inundated by rising sea levels, erosion from intense storms, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies. Pacific Northwest tribes have already been deeply affected by flooding, reduced glaciers and snowpack, seasonal shifts in winds and storms, the northward shifting of species on the land and in the ocean, and many other factors that affect tribes' ability to continue practicing treaty rights. These changes have drastically affected Indigenous peoples' hunting and fishing lifeways, economic infrastructure, water and housing availability, forest and agricultural resources, and even human health. Native harvesters in direct contact with natural resources are describing today the same drastic shifts in the environment that Western scientists had predicted would occur in the future. The real-time observations based in the traditional ecological knowledge of Native Science is alerting the world to the changes to come, often years before the studies of Western Science are able to confirm them. This scale of change will present severe challenges to all tribal cultures, resources, and well-being. Yet tribal peoples also possess cultural tools that have historically enabled Indigenous nations to mitigate or adapt to sudden environmental changes, the political sovereignty to implement new models of responding to the new changes, and a sense of community that leads people to band together to meet challenges. The focus of this anthology is on the Indigenous nations of the Pacific Rim. The region can be defined politically (as the countries that border the Pacific Ocean) or geographically (as the Pacific Basin, whose many watersheds empty their rivers and streams into the ocean). Indigenous nations along the Pacific Rim place great value on the health of the water, the watersheds, and the species (such as salmon and whales) that migrate through the waters. People living on the Pacific Coast are also commonly affected by climate change, including the shifting cycles of ocean currents, and their effects on storms, droughts, and food supplies. © 2012 Zoltán Grossman and Alan Parker.

The upstream channel of the NREB has experienced sedimentation problems requiring annual dredging operation after the construction. The main purpose of sediment dredging is to prevent flooding during late summer. According to the past records, the annual average dredging volume is about 524,170 m3 in the upstream channel of the NREB. Fluvial changes and sedimentation problems have been continued due to urbanization and development in the watershed as well as construction and management (sediment dredging) of the NREB. However, the sufficient field monitoring and researches for sedimentation characteristics and bed changes have not been performed after construction of the NREB. Therefore, bed elevation changes for 14 years (1990-2003) after construction of the NREB were analyzed using the Hec-6 model and relatively short term changes of bed elevation were simulated using RMA2 and SED2D programs with field data to review the superficial changes.

895,Aquifer salinization from storm overwash,"Anderson Jr., W.P.","Overwash processes are not only an agent of change to the morphology of barrier islands; they are also a source of instantaneous saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifers. Hatteras Island, North Carolina, USA is particularly susceptible to overwash processes because of its geography and the frequency with which tropical and extra-tropical storms strike the area. Hurricane Emily inundated the island in 1993 with saline water from Pamlico Sound. The floodwaters recharged the Buxton Woods Aquifer, raising salinity levels from approximately 40 mg/L prior to flooding to nearly 280 mg/L within several weeks of flooding. By 1997, chloride levels still had not returned to pre-storm levels. One-dimensional analytical solutions of the advection-dispersion equation are used to simulate chloride transport within the aquifer utilizing a pulse source implemented with linear superposition. These simulations are matched with chloride breakthrough curves. Initial simulations show that a pulse duration of five days provides the best fit to the data. Simulation of chloride breakthrough at two streamline locations demonstrates that higher gradients advect chloride further into the aquifer, causing higher chloride concentrations and increasing the duration of contamination. The Cape Hatteras region historically is susceptible to several hurricanes in a single season. In order to analyze the effect of multiple overwash events on water quality, predictive simulations show the effect of two overwash events separated by several time lags between storms. Simulations indicate that higher gradients and short time lags between overwash events result in chloride MCL violations that persist for more than four months.",2002,,J. Coast.

While some may argue that a market-based system will incentivize more efficient use of this essential and irreplaceable resource, increasing worldwide demand, improper practices that diminish water quality, wasteful and inefficient water management practices, and climate change will continue to reduce the availability of clean water. Today, 1.2 billion people, approximately 20% of the world population, live in water-scarce areas. It is estimated that by the year 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world’s population could be living under stressed conditions. Water resource problems that have become more serious in recent years include aquifer overdraft (i.e., mining) of groundwater systems, saltwater intrusion and/or upcoming into coastal aquifers, algal blooms of surface water systems, and extreme low flow and flooding events on rivers. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2014,,"Handb. of Engineering Hydrology: Modeling, Climate Change, and Variability",,,19-34,,10.1201/b16683,,#16600,Coppola 2014,,
900,Asynchronous budbreak in Taxodium distichum L. Richard (baldcypress) as a mode of resistance against Archips goyerana Kruse (baldcypress leafroller),"Johnson, C.W.; Goyer, R.A.; Lenhard, G.J.","Coastal stands of Taxodium distichum L. Richard (baldcypress) in Louisiana, USA, are in decline because of saltwater intrusion, prolonged flooding, and periodic defoliation by an insect herbivore, Archips goyerana Kruse (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae; the baldcypress leafroller). The objective of this study was to examine the potential for the use of variation in budbreak among half-sibling families previously evaluated for salt tolerance as a means of resistance to defoliation. Four half-sibling families were categorized as either early (FA7, SG2) or late (SW2, VE2) leafing during budbreak. Laboratory bioassays in 2002 found that larvae fed on foliage collected on the same date encountered foliage from early-leafing half-sibling families of an advanced age that was significantly lower in N, P, K, and moisture content and significantly higher in digestion-inhibiting compounds (phenolics) than foliage from later leafing half-sibling families. Insect pupal weights and relative growth rates were significantly lower on early-leafing half-sibling families. In 2003, the early and late-leafing families were experimentally synchronized with larvae by collecting foliage from family groups in order of budbreak. Foliar N remained significantly higher and total phenolics significantly lower in the late-leafing families; however, moisture content, P, K, and insect pupal weights and relative growth rates did not differ significantly between early- and late-leafing half-sibling families. Intraspecific budbreak variation in baldcypress can affect insect growth and, potentially, baldcypress leafroller populations and should be explored further. The success of coastal baldcypress restoration programs in Louisiana might be improved by capitalizing on separate traits that reduce damage from herbivory and salinity.",2007,,J. Coast.

902,Impact of upstream changes and coastal hydrodynamics on river basin characteristics in the Niger delta of Nigeria,"Balogun, I.","The Niger Delta, a sub-basin of the R. Niger, lies between latitudes 4 030̀N and 70N, and longitudes 50E and 90E. It covers an estimated land area of some 67,140km2. Its climate is typically humid with total annual rainfall in excess of 2400mm annually. The hydrology of the area is controlled by major and minor rivers, which have intricate links with a creek network that serves as transportation channels for sediments and other materials from the hinterland. During the wet season (July - October), about 119 × 109m3 of water is discharged into the delta. Hydrodynamics that characterize the Delta include flooding of the coastal wetlands, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion into swampy freshwater and groundwater resources. The trapping of sediments within dams and other storages upstream has intensified loss of beaches, coastal land and other resources to the ocean. This paper focuses not just on the impact of upstream changes and coastal hydrodynamics on the Niger Delta basin, some aspects of the socio-economy of the naturally fragile area is also discussed.",2002,,Water Studies,10,,33-42,,,,#16609,Balogun 2002,,

Five major aspects of the changes in quantity and quality of available water are discussed. Urbanization increases the frequency of flooding by increasing both rainfall and the speed of runoff. There is an increase in the volume of sediment carried by streams, with adverse ecological and economic effects. Stream temperatures rise, also causing ecological damage. Urban wastewater – storm runoff, agricultural drainage, industrial and domestic sewerage –increases pollution.

Practical examples are water flooding, solvent flooding, saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, and coning. Experiments are presented on viscous fingering in Hele‐Shaw models. The use of Hele‐Shaw cells facilitates fundamental studies of the viscous effects. For an immiscible displacement the dispersive and the relative permeability phenomena are absent. This investigation covers the entire scope of finger development from the incipient fingers predicted by Chuoke's theory to a parallel‐sided single finger. Results of several experiments run in a Hele‐Shaw cell with and without local heterogeneities show the wavelength degeneration to one finger for different flow conditions and the initial number of fingers. It was also found that the rate of growth develops almost immediately, well before the fingers are parallel sided. The mechanisms of wavelength generation and degeneration are discussed.

912,Policy,"Schmandt, J.","The preceding chapters document how climate change and climate variability will impact Texas: temperatures will rise, heat waves will occur more frequently, it will be drier west of the Interstate 35 corridor, severe weather will become more frequent, in-stream flows will fall, biodiversity will decline, and the sea level will rise. The exact timing of these changes and the speed at which they will occur remain uncertain. It is also unknown whether some of the predicted changes will occur gradually or suddenly after a tipping point has been reached. These findings echo what we presented in the first edition of this book, published in 1995. Results of more recent studies on climate change and Texas include: • In 1997 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report, Climate Change and the States, that came to similar conclusions (EPA 1997). Its findings are summarized in Table 10.1. • A national assessment published in 2000, ""The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,"" added important points: The summer heat index (which combines temperature and humidity) will increase significantly, heat stress for people and livestock will be more severe, soil moisture will decline as precipitation decreases and evaporation increases, reductions in water supply and quality will pose problems primarily for urban and poor populations, the coastal zone will suffer significant loss of property and damage to ecosystems as a result of coastal flooding and erosion, oil refineries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway will be at risk from more frequent and more intense storms, and the health of urban populations will be impaired by an increase in smog-forming gases from fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2000). • Norwine and John (2007) concluded that South Texas by 2100 will be drier, hotter, and stormier. Barrier islands will have been lost, and saltwater intrusion will diminish water supplies. • A recent study by the U.S. Global Change Research Program emphasizes the risk of more intense droughts: ""The consensus of most climate-model projections is for a reduction of cool-season precipitation across the U.S. Southwest and northwest Mexico"" (NOAA 2008). The likely impacts for Texas fall within the range of changes predicted for North America by Working Group 2 of the 2007 IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2007): IPCC assigns ""very high confidence"" to stress and damage from extreme weather and rising sea level, as well as infrastructure, health, and safety issues (Table 10.2). Taken together, the findings about the expected impacts of climate change on Texas have not changed fundamentally over the last decade and a half, but the evidence is now more extensive and detailed. In contrast, the context for policy development has changed substantially. There are several reasons for this. First, decision makers have fewer excuses to defer action because of scientific uncertainty. Key questions that were controversial two decades ago have been resolved: Yes, warming occurs not only at the earth's surface but also at higher altitudes. Yes, increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies global warming. Only the regional distribution of precipitation and the exact timing of predicted changes remain uncertain and require more study. Second, climate change is no longer a distant possibility but is occurring now. ""Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases."" This is in sharp contrast to our 1995 assumption that the impacts of climate change would be felt only by 2030. Third, the overwhelming majority of scientists are confident that observed and predicted changes in natural as well as social systems are caused by human actions. (These three statements are based on IPCC 2007.) As a result, the urgency to act on climate change has increased greatly since 1995. The 2007-2008 U.N. Human Development report starkly makes the point: ""Climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century⋯ Looking to the future, no country - however wealthy or powerful - will be immune to the impact of global warming"" (United Nations Development Program 2007). In this chapter I briefly review policy development in response to climate change at international, federal, state, and local levels and then discuss policy options for Texas. Several of the preceding chapters also discuss policy issues related to their subject matter. Here I focus on concrete policy measures that should be taken by state agencies and on development of a comprehensive state climate policy. (Table Presented).

920,"Generalization and formalization of the US EPA procedure for design of treated wastewater aquifer recharge basins: II. Retrofit of Souhil Wadi (Nabeul, Tunisia) pilot plant","Kallali, H.; Yoshida, M.; Tarhouni, J.; Jedidi, N.","The 'Cap Bon' peninsula in Tunisia suffers from intensive tourist activities, high demographic increase and industrial development. As groundwater had been for a long time the main water source, aquifers had been subject to a severe depletion and seawater intrusion. Despite the measures taken prohibiting new drillings and water carrying by the construction of a waterway linking the region to the north-west region of Tunisia, the problem of water shortage persists. Artificial recharge of groundwater with treated wastewater has been decided as a technique to replenish the region aquifers. A pilot plant was constructed in the early 1980s in Souhil Wadi (Nabeul) area. Many experiments have been carried out on this plant and have led to controversial opinions about its performance and its impact on groundwater contamination. This contribution concerns the application of the procedure that we developed from the generalization and the formalization of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) methodology for the design of treated wastewater aquifer recharge basins. This upgrading procedure implemented in a spreadsheet, has been used to retrofit the Souhil Wadi facility in order to improve its performance. This method highlighted the importance of the safety factor to estimate wastewater infiltration rate from clean water permeability measurements. It has, also, demonstrated the discordance between the initial design parameters of Souhil Wadi facility and their current status as they have changed with time and the infiltration capacity of the basins has been affected by clogging. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that with the current state of clogging of the basins, the design infiltration rate limited by the most restrictive layer (6.1 cm/hr) corresponds to 22% of the surface infiltration rate reached after a drying period of 10 d, which means that we need more basins to absorb the daily loading rate. The design method leads to the construct ion of five basins of 961 m2 (31 × 31 m) each, with one basin being flooded for 3 d with 27 cm of water daily and rested for 10 d. The current status is completely different as only four basins are constructed with 324 m2 each. Many actions in the short, medium and long term have been advised in order to improve the system performance. © IWA Publishing 2013.",2013,,Water Sci.

925,Characteristics of Seawater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers Due to Seawater Flooding: A Numerical Study,"Jeong, Y.H.; Lee, S.Y.; Lee, J.; Lee, T.K.; Lee, W.D.","In typical coastal aquifers, dense brine infiltrates under freshwater in a wedge form. However, during seawater flooding due to storm surges or tsunamis, dense brine infiltrates from the surface into the ground. In this study, to investigate the characteristics of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. we simulated seawater intrusion by seawater flooding using the Navier-Stokes solver based on the porous body model. The numerical analysis results showed that when the hydraulic gradient of the coastal aquifers was small, salt diffusion by seawater flooding occurred throughout the groundwater, and the infiltrated seawater remained in the freshwater layer for a long time. However, when the hydraulic gradient of the coastal aquifers was large, the salt damage by seawater flooding was relatively small, and the amount of infiltrated seawater that escaped into the sea through the groundwater flow increased. In other words, a larger hydraulic gradient of coastal aquifers leads to a lower salt diffusion in the groundwater by seawater flooding and a faster recovery. The results of this study will be useful for the preservation of coastal aquifers in the event of tsunamis and flooding. © 2021 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

939,Seawater intrusion in heterogeneous coastal aquifers under flooding events,"Mahmoodzadeh, D.; Karamouz, M.","Coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR) affects seawater intrusion (SWI) in aquifers. Under coastal flooding events, SWI from both sea boundary and land-surface is expected to increase. SWI in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics. In this study, the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on SWI is quantified in a two-dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer. Three indices including the seawater toe location (xtoe), the mixing volume (vmv) and the SWI volume (vswiv) are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater. A series of 50 log-normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the GCOSIM3D code. Then, numerical simulations of transient, saturated-unsaturated variable-density flow and solute transport, SUTRA, are performed in a stochastic Monte Carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity. During storm surge events, seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality. The results indicate that the storm surge has a short-term impact on fresh groundwater. The aquifer is significantly influenced by SLR as a long-term effect while it causes a larger xtoe in comparison with pre-flooding events’ conditions. Also, the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of SLR show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller xtoe which is more realistic. Comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects SWI status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events. It causes reduction in xtoe and vswiv as well as increase in vmv. This study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity, in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,J.

This study was conducted to reveal the environmental history of the wetland and its surroundings, and to evaluate the influence of human activities on the ecosystem. We used information from historical documents and sediment records to investigate the wetland. A 40-cm sediment core was collected and dated using 210Pb and 14C. Physical and chemical variables in the core were measured and pollen was analyzed. The environmental history of the Upo Wetland over the last 2,000 years was divided into three phases. Seawater may have entered the wetland around 2,000 years ago. Upo was probably a riverine wetland with a floodplain that experienced relatively rapid water flow and erosion until about AD 870. Thereafter, Upo became a palustrine wetland with lacustrine characteristics during an unstable environmental phase until some time between 870 and 1880 AD, when water flow decreased and both the water retention time and the area of flooding within the wetland increased. Construction of artificial levees within the wetland during the twentieth century constituted an anthropogenic impact superimposed on natural changes, and Upo became a shallow lake. Inputs of nutrients and other pollutants from the catchment continue to threaten the Upo ecosystem despite the establishment of policies intended to protect this important ecosystem. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2010,,J.

Increasing the seawater intrusion volume (SWIV) from both seaward boundary and land-surface can be expected in coastal aquifers as a result of coastal flooding. In the present study, a numerical method using a saturated-unsaturated density-dependent flow and transport code, SUTRA, is employed to understand how such effects can change the groundwater quality of unconfined aquifers. Storm surge simulation shows that SWIV is increased during the coastal storm below the flooded land-surface. However, this increase is a short-Term event. Also, existence of topographic depression negligibly enhances the SWIV in comparison with that of no topographic depression.

957,Climate change impact on groundwater resources in semi-arid regions,"Deshmukh, M.M.; Elbeltagi, A.; Kouadri, S.","Groundwater is one of the significant freshwater resources and provides essential freshwater supply, chiefly in dry regions where surface water availability is limited. However, groundwater-related problems are among today's most acute and complex technical problems. The climate change outcomes connected to water resources are an increase in temperature, variation in precipitation patterns, snow cover, and a probable increase in the frequency of flooding and droughts. Due to this, climate change intensifies the global hydrological cycle and affects the quality and quantity of groundwater resources. Climate changes also disturb the hydrological cycle, directly increasing the evaporation level of accessible superficial water and vegetation transpiration and affecting the amounts of soil infiltration and deeper percolation. Subsequently, these variations can directly affect evaporative demand over land, rainfall rate, timings, and concentration rates and indirectly affect the flux and storage of water in surface (i.e. lakes, rivers, seas) and subsurface (i.e. groundwater storage (GWS) reservoirs. In addition, there are other related factors such as groundwater contamination, seawater intrusion, and water scarcity. Climate changes affect surface water resources through climate variants such as air temperature, rainfall, and vegetation transpiration variations, and these variations also affect groundwater storage. Larger rainfall variations directly affect surface water levels and seawater intrusion and result in a drop in water storage. These variations directly affect groundwater storage depending on the percolation rate, volume, and distribution of groundwater recharge. We need to find out the solution on the impact of climate change and groundwater resources and exact estimation of groundwater recharge in the semi-arid region. For understanding climate variations, several global climate models (GCMs) are available. GCMs help detect quantification of groundwater recharge and provide a suitable adaption scheme to protect groundwater storage from climate change.

962,Effects of salinity and flooding on post-hurricane regeneration potential in coastal wetland vegetation,"Middleton, B.A.","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The nature of regeneration dynamics after hurricane flooding and salinity intrusion may play an important role in shaping coastal vegetation patterns. METHODS: The regeneration potentials of coastal species, types and gradients (wetland types from seaward to landward) were studied on the Delmarva Peninsula after Hurricane Sandy using seed bank assays to examine responses to various water regimes (unflooded and flooded to 8 cm) and salinity levels (0, 1, and 5 ppt). Seed bank responses to treatments were compared using a generalized linear models approach. Species relationships to treatment and geographical variables were explored using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. KEY RESULTS: Flooding and salinity treatments affected species richness even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). Maritime forest was especially intolerant of salinity intrusion so that species richness was much higher in unflooded and low salinity conditions, despite the proximity of maritime forest to salt-marsh along the coastal gradient. Other vegetation types were also affected, with potential regeneration of these species affected in various ways by flooding and salinity, suggesting relationships to post-hurricane environment and geographic position. CONCLUSIONS: Seed germination and subsequent seedling growth in coastal wetlands may in some cases be affected by salinity intrusion events even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). These results indicate that the potential is great for hurricanes to shift vegetation type in sensitive wetland types (e.g., maritime forest) if post-hurricane environments do not support the regeneration of extent vegetation. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.",2016,,Am.

One adaption strategy to increasing salinity is shrimp production, which however, heavily relies on antibiotic usage. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of increasing salinity on the dissipation rates of antibiotics in tropical flooded soil systems. For this purpose, paddy top soil from a coastal Vietnamese delta was spiked with selected frequently used antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) and incubated with flood water of different salt concentrations (0, 10, 20 g L−1). Antibiotic concentrations were monitored in water and soil phases over a period of 112 days using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We found that sulfamethazine was the most persistent antibiotic in the flooded soil system (DT50 = 77 days), followed by sulfadiazine (DT50 = 53 days), trimethoprim (DT50 = 3 days) and sulfamethoxazole (DT50 = 1 days). With the exception of sulfamethoxazole, the apparent distribution coefficient increased significantly (p < 0.05) for all antibiotics in course of the incubation, which indicates an accumulation of antibiotics in soil. On a whole system basis, including soil and water into the assessment, there was no overall salinity effect on the dissipation rates of antibiotics, suggesting that common e-fate models remain valid under varying salinity. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Sci.

981,"Dynamics of sediment transport and stratification in Changjiang River Estuary, China","Li, L.; He, Z.; Xia, Y.; Dou, X.","Suspended sediment transport and stratification in the entire Changjiang River Estuary were examined using the field data of sea-surface level, currents, salinity, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The data were simultaneously observed at one-hour intervals and at six vertical layers at 23 stations covering two spring tidal cycles in May, 2004. The results showed that ebbing tides had a longer tidal duration and stronger tidal currents than flooding tides, due to a fresh water discharge. The tidal range reached about 4 m and the peak tidal current of about 2.9 m/s occurred in the north passage in the observed period. A stratification caused by salinity and suspended sediment appeared and varied with tides indicated by the overall Richardson number. The potential energy anomaly was larger when SSC was factored in to the water density. A stratification ratio (Sr), which is the ratio of potential energy required to induce complete mixing to the overall potential energy, was proposed to measure the degree of sediment stratification. Sr values indicated that mixing the stratified turbid water took as much as 0.25% of the overall potential energy at a particular field station. A turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) was observed in the north passage, where the salt-fresh-water interface and stratification appeared, due to the advective and tidal transport component. The main components controlling the vertical-averaged net sediment transport were the Eulerian velocity, Stokes drift and tidal pumping. Salinity intrusion creates the stratification in the north passage, which depresses the turbulence and re-suspension of sediment. The stratification is further enhanced by the vertical distribution of suspended sediment, which results in a TMZ and induces sediment deposition/trapping in the channel. Hence, the SSC was essential to be considered in the study of estuarine stratification, particularly in the highly turbid estuaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Estuar. Coast.

982,Application of a decision support framework to analyse scoping development scenarios in the Mekong River Basin,"Beecham, R.; Podger, G.; Johnston, R.; Cross, H.","Water resources development in the Mekong River Basin is considered necessary for economic growth and poverty alleviation in the region. Apart from local impacts of these developments, there are concerns about the cumulative impacts on a regional scale, particularly on the enormously productive fisheries of the basin. These impacts are also across national borders, and need to be well understood so as to contribute to regional cooperation. A Decision Support Framework (DSF), including linked catchment, river system, and hydrodynamic models of the whole basin, was developed to provide information on water availability, and to estimate hydrologic and associated ecological and economic effects of a range of water resource development scenarios. A set of scoping scenarios, focused on irrigation and hydropower dams was formulated to test different levels and combinations of development. These scenarios were configured within the DSF, and the hydrologic impacts and salinity intrusion impacts directly estimated from the linked models. Indicators were developed and implemented to assess the corresponding impacts on a range of sectors, including fisheries, irrigation, hydropower, flooding, and navigation. The results confirm the importance of a balanced and coordinated approach to water management. © HWRS 2006.",2020,,"Hydrol. Water Resour. Symp., HWRS",,,,,,,#16747,Beecham 2020,,
983,Adaptation to flood and salinity environments in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical analysis of farmer-led innovations,"Tran, T.A.; Nguyen, T.H.; Vo, T.T.","Agriculture is exposed to climatic impacts, especially in developing countries. Adaptation is the predominant practice that farming communities undertake to deal with these climate-induced challenges. While significant attention has been devoted to farmers’ adaptation strategies, little is known about how innovative practices are associated with the improvement of rural livelihoods. To address this gap, the paper attempts to investigate how farmers lead the process of rural innovations that constitute successful forms of adaptation to address the mixed impacts of dyke policies and climate change in two distinct agro-ecological zones (i.e. flooding and salinity) in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Drawing on qualitative information collected from focus group discussions and interviews across the case studies, the paper argues that farmers are the key innovation actors who contribute to improving rural farming and water management practices. The study suggests that the evolution of farmer-led innovations is mainly attributed to the operation of various informal learning networks that provide important platforms for the generation and diffusion of effective innovative practices across farming communities. It also highlights how farmers contribute their innovative knowledge to local adaptation policies. From the policy perspective, this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers’ adaptation, which needs to be scaled out to better support agricultural water management in the delta. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,Agric.

These zones have very distinct bio-physical conditions and cropping cycles that will affect methane emissions in various forms. Our study includes comprehensive mapping of these zones as well as an overview of rice statistics (activity data) at provincial level for each cropping season. Emission data were obtained by the closed chamber method. The available data set comprises 7 sites with 15 cropping seasons. Mean emission rates showed large variations ranging from 0.31 to 9.14 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1. Statistical analysis resulted in weighted means for all zones that we use as zone-specific CH4 emission factors (EFz) in the context of the IPCC Tier 2 approach. The lowest EFz was computed for the saline accounting for 1.14 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 (confidence interval: 0.60–2.14). The EFz values of the alluvial and acid sulfate zones were 2.39 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 (2.19–4.13) and 2.78 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 (2.65–3.76), respectively, which indicated that they were not different from each other derived from their confidence intervals. The deep flood zone, however, required a season-specific, assessment of EFz because emission in the autumn–winter cropping season, corresponding to the wet period, was significantly higher (9.14 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 (7.08–11.2)) than the other seasons (2.24 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 (1.59–3.47)). Although these emission factors correspond to baseline water management and do not capture the diversity of farmers’ practices, we see the availability of zone-specific data as an important step for a more detailed assessment of Business as Usual emissions as well as possible mitigation potentials in one of the most important rice growing regions of the world. © 2017 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.",2018,,Soil Sci.

Smallholder farmers must adapt to climate change to sustain rice production as their central and most important livelihood activity. A sample was stratified across agro-ecological areas in the Delta affected by flooding, alluvial soils, acid sulphate soils, and saline water intrusion and by derived farmer typologies. A rural livelihoods approach was used in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify and enumerate enabling and constraining adaptation factors. Smallholders experienced diverse natural hazards such as floods, abnormal rains, high temperatures, water scarcity, and salinity intrusion specific to the agro-ecological areas. Adaptation was constrained by labour shortages, water quality, topography, access to combine harvesters, transportation infrastructure, dryers and household savings. Adaptation was enabled by farming techniques and experience, cooperative groups, water quantity, access to information, and ability to purchase agro-chemicals through credit. Small farmers (< 1 ha) were more constrained than large farmers (> 1 ha) who had an expanded livelihood asset base. A range of policy implications are discussed, but adaptation is not just about technological fixes but requires overall improvements in a range of human, social and financial components. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,Int.

992,Succession in wetlands,"Middleton, B.A.","                             Succession refers to the change in vegetation over time driven by disturbances and the maturation of plant species. In wetlands, these disturbances include water and salinity level changes along other factors that can alter vegetation. The historical view of succession (Clementsian) was that vegetation change represented the linear progression of through stages of vegetation toward a climax state. These stages were thought to be comprised of species that were interlocked with each other. These days the idea that succession is represented by the successive replacement of highly related sets of communities over time has been deemphasized, in favor of the idea that species in the community act more independently of one another (Gleasonian). An important example of this Gleasonian perspective model has been developed for prairie wetlands of North America by van der Valk. In this view, succession proceeds in a cyclic fashion, with flooding and drought driving changes in specific species, so that the indi- vidualistic species responses to water regime and other disturbances drive changes in the system (Environmental Sieve Model). The succession of many other world wetlands types is thought to occur in a similar way. These recent ideas of succession emphasize that species that are able to regenerate after disturbance via seed banks and propagules, and that the nature of post-distur- bance regeneration is the most important determinant of later succession (initial floristics). Notably, the idea that lakes and bogs represent an early state of succession, and that depressions fill in to become dry land (terrestrialization) has little evidence. With climate change, wetlands are likely to have altered successional trajectories, particularly as these ecosystems become exposed to different climatic temperatures, flooding/drought cycles, salinity intrusion and increased CO                             2                             .                          © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

Here we present the risks for impacts and the farmers' autonomous and planned public adaptation by using primary and secondary data. The latter studies showed that a proportion of the pangasius farms located in the coastal provinces will be affected by salinity intrusion in the dry season. Options to adapt to this are: modify pangasius farming practice, stock other species or stock saline-tolerant pangasius. With research and extension support, farmers can further improve their already adapted practice to deal with salinity or use water recirculation systems for prolonged nursery rearing. A breeding program for saline-tolerant striped catfish requires a medium-to long-term investment (0.4 % of the production cost) from government and/or private company. Pangasius farms in up- and mid-stream regions and in coastal areas, which are not located within upgraded government dyke-protected areas, will be affected by flooding at the end of each rainy season. This implies an increased cost for dykes to about 0.34% and 0.25% of the total variable costs for one harvest per ha in the up- and mid-stream regions, and in the downstream region, respectively.",2016,,Tropicultura,34,Specialissue,105-115,,,,#16767,Nguyen 2016,,
998,Spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology and cropping systems in the Mekong Delta with special reference to the seasonal water flow of the Mekong and Bassac rivers,"Sakamoto, T.; Van Nguyen, N.; Ohno, H.; Ishitsuka, N.; Yokozawa, M.","Multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was used to estimate the spatial distribution of heading date and rice-cropping system employed in the Mekong Delta relative to seasonal changes in water resources in 2002 and 2003. We improved a Wavelet-based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP) and developed a Wavelet-based Filter for evaluating the spatial distribution of Cropping Systems (WFCS) to the interpretation of MODIS time-series data to determine the spatial distribution of rice phenology and various rice-cropping systems from the seasonal Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The findings correspond well the physical characteristics of the cropping system in the Mekong Delta, which have changed over time in response to localized and seasonal changes in water resources. One such example is the double-irrigated rice-cropping system commonly employed in the upper Mekong Delta in the dry season to avoid damage due to the subsequent floods. The shortage of suitable irrigation water and intrusion of saline water in the coastal regions during the dry season has constrained the practice dry-season cropping and has meant that the double- and single-rainfed rice-cropping systems are employed in the rainy season. A triple-irrigated rice-cropping system is used in the central part of the Mekong Delta which is located midway between the flood-prone and salinity intrusion areas. Analysis of annual changes in the rice cropping systems between 2002 and 2003 showed that the triple-cropped rice expanded to the flood- and salinity-intrusion areas. This expansion indicates that the implementation of measures to limit the extent of flooding and salinity intrusion by improved farming technologies and improvements in land management. The heading dates in the upper Mekong Delta in 2003 were earlier than in 2002 by approximately 20 to 30 days. The reasons for this would be due to decreased flood runoff in 2002 compared to 2001, and implementation of government policies regarding early sowing of dry-season crops. Subsequent analysis of the MODIS data confirmed that the spatial distribution of rice-cropping systems was closely related to seasonal changes in river runoff regime in the Mekong Delta. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, demands of food security, economic development, and climate change continue to pose diverging and often conflicting challenges for water resources management in the upper, central, and coastal zones of the delta. The major changes effected in the VMD's hydrological regime and land-use patterns are acknowledged in the literature, but few studies have examined the interplay between these dynamics at the delta scale. Based on time-series maps and statistical data on land-use, flooding, and salinity intrusion, we investigated the interrelations between land-use dynamics and changes in hydrological regime across the VMD in three representative periods. Land-use was found to be highly variable, changing by 14.94% annually between 2001 and 2012. Rice cropping underwent the greatest change, evolving from single cropping of traditional varieties towards double and triple cropping of high-yielding varieties. Aquaculture remained stable after rapid expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s. Meanwhile, flooding and salinity intrusion were increasingly controlled by hydrological infrastructure erected to supply freshwater for agriculture. Effects of this infrastructure became particularly evident from 2001 to 2012. During this period, spatial and temporal impacts on flooding and salinity intrusion were found, which extended beyond the rice fields to affect adjacent lands and livelihood activities. Unforeseen effects will likely be aggravated by climate change, suggesting a need to rethink the scale of planning towards a more integrated hydrologic approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Land Use Policy,73,,269-280,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.01.030,,#16777,Le 2018,,
1003,Responses of estuarine circulation and salinity to the loss of intertidal flats - A modeling study,"Yang, Z.; Wang, T.","Intertidal flats in estuaries are coastal wetlands that provide critical marine habitats to support wide ranges of marine species. Over the last century many estuarine systems have experienced significant loss of intertidal flats due to anthropogenic impacts. This paper presents a modeling study conducted to investigate the responses of estuarine hydrodynamics to the loss of intertidal flats in Whidbey Basin of Puget Sound on the northwest coast of North America. Changes in salinity intrusion limits in the estuaries, salinity stratification, and circulation in intertidal flats and estuaries were evaluated by comparing model results under the existing baseline condition and the no-flat condition. Model results showed that loss of intertidal flats results in an increase in salinity intrusion, stronger mixing, and a phase shift in salinity and velocity fields in the bay front areas. Model results also indicated that loss of intertidal flats enhances two-layer circulation, especially the bottom water intrusion. Loss of intertidal flats increases the mean salinity but reduces the salinity range in the subtidal flats over a tidal cycle because of increased mixing. Salinity intrusion limits extend upstream in all three major rivers discharging into Whidbey Basin when no intertidal flats are present. Changes in salinity intrusion and estuarine circulation patterns due to loss of intertidal flats affect the nearshore habitat and water quality in estuaries and potentially increase risk of coastal hazards, such as storm surge and coastal flooding. Lastly, model results suggested the importance of including intertidal flats and the wetting-and-drying process in hydrodynamic simulations when intertidal flats are present in the model domain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,,Cont.

Under the combination effect of waves, tide movement, long-shore and cross-shore current, and river flow, sediment is transported and deposited at the river mouth, forming sand bars at this area. Sand bars at river mouth influence extremely to river flow features in the river, obstruct navigation and flood discharge. The feature of waves, river flow and bed layer material are the main factors that relate directly to the characteristics of sand bar. However, it can prevent the river from salinity intrusion, and be flushed easily in flood season. Understanding sand bar formation at river mouth and its size are necessary for flooding and navigation control. In this study, the actions of river flow are eliminated because river discharge is often small in the winter this is good condition for sand bar formation at river mouth. The development of sand bar is highly considered by a lot of managers, engineers both in the elevation and horizon. This study will show the estimation about the height and width of sand bar at river entrance as well as its profile area. A field observation on the formation process of sand bar was carried out at river mouth after being flushed by the flood in the river to verify laboratory experimental results. © 31st IAHR Congress 2005: Water Engineering for the Future, Choices and Challenges.

The greatest impact on the volume of water supply and runoff is exerted by the spring flooding of rice fields in May-June. Filtration from the canals has a great effect on the groundwater regime, rises the level of groundwater in the canal zone, causing flooding, waterlogging and salinization of territories adjacent to the canals, up to their withdrawal from the agricultural use. Filtration losses from the interfarm and on-farm networks depend on the frequency of works, the type of soil, and the degree of turbidity of the irrigation water. The study substantiates the methods of improving the regime of saving drainage and discharge runoff in rice systems in dry years.

The objectives of our study were to explore the spatiotemporal correlation of saline-alkali land and salt-leaching irrigation with groundwater As in the Hetao Plain. Therefore, groundwater As concentrations during Period I (2006–2010) and Period II (2016–2020) were collected by historical data and chemical measurements. Salt-leaching irrigation area and saline-alkali land area in Period I and Period II were extracted through remote sensing data. With the increase of the salt-leaching irrigation area level (SLIAL) and saline-alkali land area level (SALAL), the variation trend in groundwater As concentration slightly fluctuated, with an increase in the SLIAL at the low SALAL, which may be because short-term flooding may not considerably enhance As mobilization. Lower groundwater As concentrations appeared in regions with higher SLIAL and lower SALAL. A larger saline-alkali land area (higher SALAL) increased the groundwater As concentration. The path analysis model confirmed that salt-leaching irrigation may increase groundwater salinity to affect groundwater As levels and to decrease the saline-alkali land area. From Periods I to II, the difference in path analysis results may imply that the decrease in the saline-alkali land area may have influenced As mobilization due to competitive adsorption caused by the increase in total dissolved solids (TDS) in groundwater. Our results provide new insights for the impacts of saline-alkali land and salt-leaching irrigation both on groundwater As concentration and the geochemical processes of As enrichment in arid and semi-arid areas with more serious salinization. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Remote Sens.,14,21,,,10.3390/rs14215586,,#16806,Yin 2022,,

Time to recover to pre-storm levels was 10 times greater for groundwater specific conductivity, with a median value of 20 days, while groundwater level had a median recovery time of 2 days. A frequency-magnitude analysis indicates that the percent of time with salinization is higher for Melissa than for energetic hurricanes.

1029,Salt diffusion effect on the submarine permafrost state and distribution as well as on the stability zone of methane hydrates on the Laptev Sea shelf,"Malakhova, V.V.; Eliseev, A.V.","Salt transport in shelf sediments can affect the state of the submarine permafrost and the thermodynamic stability of hydrates. To estimate the effect of salt transport, we used a model analysis of salinization of underwater sediments. It is assumed that the salininization follows the flooding of the shelf, which accompanies transgression of the ocean during the end of the glaciations of the Quaternary period. We used the model of thermal processes in the bottom-set bed, developed in collaboration with the Institute of Numerical Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics, Sibe¬ rian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Science. The model was augmented by the equation of salt diffusion in the bottom sediments. In calculations with the model, changes in the temperature of the upper surface of bottom sediments and sea level over the past 400 kyr were prescribed (set). It is shown that the combined effect of heat and salinization of bottom sediments during oceanic transgressions (shelf flooding) leads to the sinking of the current upper boundary of the marine permafrost by about 10-25 m below the sea floor, depending on the current depth of the shelf. Accounting for the salt diffusion is necessary to determine the position of the upper boundary of the permafrost, as well as to calculate the rate of its deg¬ radation. In particular, salt transport is able to change both the current position and the rate of displacement of the upper permafrost boundary in several times relative to the case of a time-independent freezing temperature. Note, that this effect is insignificant for estimation of the position of the lower permafrost boundary in the bottom sediments of the inner shelf. Lowering the freezing point leads to the fact that frozen rocks on the outer shelf completely thaw at negative temperatures of bottom sediments under the influence of heat and salts in the present period (experiments TF-2, TFSAL2). The influence of salinity on the characteristics of the stability zone of methane hydrates in the submarine permafrost is insignificant due to deep level of their occurrence in the shelf sediments. © 2020 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

1036,Agro-ecological typology of agricultural land use in the arid steppe of the Altai Krai,"Tatarintsev, L.M.; Merzlyakov, O.E.; Karbozov, T.E.; Koshzhanova, F.K.","Introduction. Issues related to increasing the sustainability of agricultural land in the Altai Krai are very relevant, modern and practically significant, since about 90 % of the territory is more or less subject to degradation processes. They reduce soil fertility and, as a result, the productivity of agricultural land, which is largely due to the landscape specificity of the territory. The solution to the problem is possible on the basis of adaptive landscape land management, which is the basis for organizing sustainable agricultural land use. When designing agricultural landscapes, on the one hand, we take into account and preserve the natural properties of the territory, and on the other hand, we limit the anthropogenic impact on it. By designing sustainable, capable of self-regulation and self-reproduction of agricultural landscapes, it is possible to optimize agricultural land use. The purpose of the study: to conduct an agro-ecological typology of agricultural lands (agro-landscapes) of the arid steppe of the Altai Krai to optimize the existing agricultural land use and increase its sustainability. Research methods. System analysis has become the main scientific method for analyzing the relationships and mutual influences within landscapes. When studying and comparing the physical and geographical characteristics of the territory, comparative geographical and ecological landscape methods were used using the cartographic method and GIS technologies. Research results. The allocation of agro-ecological groups of lands is based on the leading agro-ecological factors (moisture supply, erosion, waterlogging, periodic flooding, salinization, alkalinity), the degree of their manifestation and related limiting factors. As a zonal agro-ecological group, we identified upland lands, which occupy 22 % of the study area. Slope (or erosional) lands in the arid steppe occupy a significant proportion (59 % of the area) and are located on slopes with a steepness of up to 3°, in some places 5°. Taking into account the wide spatial development of deflation processes (44 % of the subzone area), the authors of the work singled out a special agroecological group of lands – deflationary lands in the composition of eroded lands. The deflationary lands were divided into three agro-ecological groups: weakly, medium and strongly deflated lands. Insignificant territories (less than 1% of the subzone area) are combined into a group of waterlogged lands, which differ in the degree of hydromorphism and have a common feature – ecological waterlogging, which makes it difficult or excludes the possibility of cultivating crops. The territories in the soil cover of which solonets occupy more than 10 % of the area are combined into a group of solonetz lands, which occupy slightly more than 4 % of the area of the zone. The group of solonetzic lands is divided into two parts – solonetzic-automorphic and solonetzic-hydromorphic. Also, a group of lands of the ravine-beam complex was identified, which are limited, since the depth of the dissection of the territory does not exceed 10 m, and the density is insignificant or weak (1-2,5 km and more than 2,5 km). In nine municipal districts that are part of the arid steppe, the identified types of land are found in different proportions. For the sustainable development of agricultural land use, its optimization is necessary, associated with a reduction in the area of agricultural land by 14,5 thousand hectares with fluctuations in districts from 0,7 (Suetsky district) to 2.3 thousand hectares (in Blagoveshchensky and Rubtsovsky districts) and an increase in the area of industrial land (by 12,4 thousand hectares) due to the allocation of protected zones along railways and roads, green protective zones around settlements, as well as shelterbelt forest belts. Conclusions 1. An agro-ecological typology of agricultural lands in the arid steppe of the Altai Krai was produced; 2. It has been established that the main limiting factors affecting the productivity of agricultural land are the degree of deflation, relief, the presence and density of hydrographic objects, the degree of waterlogging and salinity, which significantly affect landscapes under different management conditions; 3. For the municipal districts of the arid steppe, the change in the ratio of lands was calculated, taking into account limiting factors, as well as the stability of agricultural landscapes as a result of the transformation of the structure of sown areas, lands, and crop rotations; 4.

The developed model created in the Modflow software reproduces spatial heterogeneity of mined out rocks and flow characteristics on the site of mine nr. 2 ""Novohrodivs’ka"" in the Donetsk coal basin. The model was balanced with the available data on mine water level rebound. The temperature of mine water drained to maintain a safe water level to prevent flooding and salinization of the upper aquifer is expected to range from 18 to 21ºС, which is consistent with the indicators of the geothermal system at the Blagodatna mine in Western Donbas. It was shown by modeling, that active water withdrawal may lead to replacing warm mine waters with colder infiltration water and gradual slight lowering of its temperature and decreasing the maximum thermal capacity. © 2022 EAGE.

1046,Technogenesis and its impact on oil reservoirs development,"Gaydukov, L.A.; Mikhailov, N.N.","On the example of unconsolidated high-viscosity oil reservoirs in Western Siberia and saline reservoirs with heterogeneous wettability in Eastern Siberia, based on actual operational data, laboratory experiments and numerical modeling, an analysis of the influence of anomalous effects of technogenesis on development indicators is carried out. Technogenesis refers to the stage of transformation of rocks in reservoir conditions under technogenic influence, when the technogenic processes mainly influence on the rocks composition and properties and fluids saturating, and natural conditions play a related role. Abnormal effects is understood as behavior deviating from the norm, general patterns accepted in the practice of oil reservoir development. Based on field data and generalization of previous studies, it is shown that during the development of unconsolidated reservoirs with highviscosity oil a complex of anomalous effects of technogenesis occurs: deformation, destruction of the reservoir with an abnormal decrease in well productivity; destruction of screening clay bridges; formation of preferential filtration channels («wormholes»); the effect of «foaming oil»; intra-reservoir emulsification of oil. For saline formations, the reservoir desalinization effect in the process of flooding with low-mineralized water can have both positive and negative effect on the reservoir development indicators, depending on the degree and nature of the salinization spread along the section. On the actual examples, it is shown that standard modeling approaches and development design techniques do not fully take into account the specifics of the technogenesis of formations complicated by a unique complex of geological and physical factors. Achieving the efficiency targets of such hydrocarbon deposits is impossible without creating a scientific and methodological basis corresponding to the technogenesis specifics. Thus, the article substantiates the importance of creating scientific foundations for the oil reservoirs development in the conditions of abnormal technogenesis effects. © 2022, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

1055,Drip irrigation in agricultural saline-alkali land controls soil salinity and improves crop yield: Evidence from a global meta-analysis,"Du, Y.; Liu, X.; Zhang, L.; Zhou, W.","Saline-alkali land, a precious candidate arable land resources, plays a critical role in achieving agricultural sustainability. Drip irrigation (DI) is an effective method for rationalizing of saline-alkali land. Nevertheless, the inapposite application of DI increases the risk of secondary salinization, significantly leading to severe soil degradation and yield decline. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impacts of DI on soil salinity and crop yield to determine the appropriate DI management strategies for an irrigated agricultural system in saline-alkali land. The results showed that DI generally decreased soil salinity in the root zone by 37.7 % and increased crop yield by 37.4 % relative to flooding irrigation (FI). Drip emitters with a flow rate of 2–4 L h−1 were recommended to obtain positive effects on soil salinity control and agricultural production when an irrigation quota was below 50 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and the salinity of irrigation water was between 0.7 and 2 dS m−1. Further, we also found that drip-irrigated cotton had a higher yield on fine-textured saline soils.

1056,Features of forming the salt balance in rice fields with various parameters and designs of the Danube rice irrigation systems,"Turchenyuk, V.; Rokochinskiy, A.; Prykhodko, N.; Volk, P.; Meshyk, O.","Ecological-reclamation state of rice irrigation systems harvest of cultivated crops determined by a number of factors, including natural (soil, topographical, hydrogeological, climatic factors) and technological (irrigation norm, designs and parameters of irrigation and drainage networks, etc.) factors. One of the main factors influencing the formation of rice yield which is traditionally grown by flooding technology is the efficiency of the rice irrigation system's design. Construction features of irrigation fields and their parameters (distances between the drains, depth of the drainage network) affect the intensity of the processes of salinization of soils and groundwater. Analysis of the components of salt balances of rice fields with different parameters and designs on example of the Danube rice irrigation systems showed that fields with the distances between the drains from 200 to 250 m have significant advantages over Krasnodar-type fields with the same parameters and over fields with 500 m distance between the drains creating optimal salt regime for rice and, accordingly, obtaining higher yields of rice. As on the card-checks with drainage with the distances between the drains 500 m uniform desalinization of soils on all area cannot be reached and yield of rice on them is close to 20 c/ha such card-checks with drainage must be converted into card-checks with drainage with the distances between the drains 250 m. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

1061,Analysis of the agricultural land qualitative state for agricultural land use in the Altai Krai,"Tatarintsev, V.L.; Merzlyakov, O.E.; Ozeranskaya, N.L.; Shakenova, Z.K.","Introduction. Modern agricultural land use should be resistant to external and internal factors, organized on the principles of resource optimization and digitalization of processes, using biologization tools to achieve the goal related to the quality of agricultural products. Achieving this goal is possible by regulating the production process in the agrolandscape, namely, by analyzing the leading agroecological factors (erosion and deflation processes, moisture and heat supply, salinization, flooding, etc.) and conditions. An innovative approach related to the analysis of the existing potential of the territory of agricultural land, factors limiting agricultural production, will determine the direction of land use, predict the potential and reduce the land intensity of agricultural production and raw materials at the level of the municipal district, where a set of measures for land management is being designed, thereby increasing their resilience. The purpose of the study. To assess the qualitative state of agricultural land in an agrarian territory (by municipal districts) in the arid steppe of the Altai Krai to increase its sustainability. Research methods. System analysis was the main scientific method used in the work. It made it possible to compare the interrelationships and mutual influences in the analysis of the structure of lands. Comparative geographic and ecological landscape methods were also used in the study and analysis of the characteristics of the territory using the cartographic method and GIS technologies. Methods of mathematical statistics were used to determine the stability of agricultural land. Research results. The modern assessment of the agrarian territory of the arid steppe (nine municipal districts) carried out in the work showed that erosion processes were not widespread on the agricultural lands of the territory. Judging by the data obtained, large areas of the arid steppe are subject to destruction by wind. More than 80 % of the area of agricultural land is deflationary areas. The area of deflationary and deflated land is 200 thousand hectares with a minimum value in the Suetsky district and a maximum in Rodinsky. The main area of deflationary soils is observed in arable land (76-96 %), followed by pastures and hayfields. Based on the assessment of the qualitative state of agricultural land in the arid steppe in terms of the ratio of the areas of eroded and deflated lands with various degrees of degradation (weak, medium, strong), as well as non-eroded and non-deflated areas, we made an integral assessment of the state, which allows us to judge the stability of a large agar area. In total, five classes or groups of lands were identified: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and a score from 1 to 5 was assigned. It follows from the materials that the anti-erosion resistance is much higher than the anti-deflation one. The erosion resistance of the arable land is the same in seven areas of the arid steppe (the sum of points is 3). Judging by the sum of points, the stability of arable land in the Suetsky and Rubtsovsky districts is somewhat less than in other districts. The area under hayfields is less stable than the area occupied by arable land. The territory of pastures is even less stable than the territory of arable land and hayfields, which is confirmed by some increase in the total number of points. A more noticeable decrease in the stability of the pasture area is observed in the Suetsky and Volchikhinsky districts compared to the rest of the districts. A very high and high degree of resistance of agricultural land to the combined effects of erosion and deflation is typical for the Khabarsky and Rubtsovsky districts, (for which the sum of points is 30 and 33, respectively. scores are 50 and 55, respectively). The calculated gradations of the degree of stability of the territory occupied by agricultural land confirm that the agricultural land of all the studied areas is more resistant to erosion. This is indicated by the narrow range of variation and the minimum values of dispersion and standard deviation. Judging by the value of the coefficient of variation, the variability of the trait is considered low (V=15 %). In relation to deflation and the combined influence of erosion and deflation, the stability indicators of agricultural lands change in a wider range of variation, and the degree of variability of the attribute is considered significant (V=22% and 32 %). Сonclusions. 1. Аn assessment was made of the qualitative state of agricultural land in the arid steppe of the Altai Krai on an area of about 1,8 million hectares. 2. It has been established that erosion-hazardous and deflation-hazardous lands are widespread in arable land; in municipal districts, there is a wide range of areas subject to degradation processes, regardless of the type of land; 3. For the municipal regions of the arid steppe, the points of stability of agricultural lands, the range of variation, the arithmetic mean, the coefficient of variation and other statistical characteristics of the stability of arable land, hayfields and pastures were determined. 4. The obtained results of the research can be used by the authorities (regional and municipal) in the long-term planning and management of land resources, as well as landowners and land users - in the organization and optimization of agricultural land. © 2022 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

1068,Storm surge impact in the hydrodynamics of a tidal lagoon: The case of Ria de Aveiro,"Picado, A.; Lopes, C.L.; Mendes, R.; Vaz, N.; Dias, J.M.","Storm surges are a hazardous phenomenon, since they may flood large coastal areas, causing socio-economical and habitation losses. Thus, the study of their characteristics and effects in coastal regions is crucial to prevent their negative consequences. This work aims at assessing the storm surges impact in the hydrodynamics of a tidal lagoon located in the north-western Portuguese coast (Ria de Aveiro). Storm surge amplitudes of 0.58 m, 0.84 m and 1.17 m for 2, 10 and 100 return periods, respectively, were determined adjusting the annual maximum amplitudes to a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. To assess the hydrodynamic changes in the Ria de Aveiro under storm surge conditions, numerical modeling simulations were carried out, considering four scenarios: a single astronomical tidal forcing (reference) and astronomical tide plus 2, 10 and 100 years return period surges. Maximum levels and velocities for the entire lagoon and the tidal prism for the main cross-sections were determined and compared with the reference scenario. Generally, the model results suggest that during storm surge events the maximum levels increase in whole domain, with the largest increase found for the 100 return period storm surge scenario (1.17 m). The most significant changes occur at the main channels head for all scenarios, revealing that these regions are the most vulnerable to marginal flooding. Also, storm surges induce higher velocities and tidal prisms in the lagoon, increasing the marginal risk of erosion, as well as the salinization of the lagoon marginal lands. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.",2013,,J.

1085,The main factors of adverse environmental impact of potash production and methods of environmental protection,"Vysotskaya, N.A.; Piskun, E.V.","Currently, an adverse environmental factor in the Soligorsk mining district is the effect of underground mining on the terrain and landscape. The remarkable thing is that flooding and waterlogging in the undermined territory of the potash mine fields is connected with specific natural conditions of the district. Clay-salt tailings are known to be stored in salt tailings piles. To prevent the filtration of brines and diffusive penetration of salts into underlying soil and groundwater and thereby prevent salinization of geological environment, in the areas where salt tailings piles are located and on the slopes of bund walls, an impervious screen is arranged. It was noted that in recent years, Belaruskali OJSC’s ore departments have been widely using high-altitude solid waste piling method, which reduces the area occupied by salt tailings piles. To prevent and eliminate excess brines, Belaruskali introduced a method for biological reclamation of spent salt tailings piles, which provides for creation of vegetation on the soil layer surface and the conditions for its self-regeneration. Five degrees of groundwater pollution in the Soligorsk industrial district were distinguished: low, medium, periodically high, high, and catastrophically high. It was found that the following factors have negative impact on flora and fauna in the district where potash enterprises operate: land acquisition for industrial sites, salt tailings piles and TSF and, as a result, reduction in the area of vegetation cover; flooding and waterlogging of lands due to subsidence of the earth’s surface above the worked-out mine workings; salinization of territories adjacent to the enterprise by excess brines; impact of industrial dust and gas emission. One of salinization control measures is creation of forest shelter belts. © 2019, National University of Science and Technology MISIS. All rights reserved.",2019,,Min. Sci.

1099,Changing of hydrogeological conditions under emergency deformation of the undermined rock massif (with an example of berezniki-1 mine),"Mustel, P.; Shlendova, T.K.","This work considers changes in hydrogeological conditions under emergency deformation of the undermined rock massif at Berezniki-1 mine in the time of flooding the mine, forming of sinks on the earth surface and subsequent restoring of equilibrium state in geological environment. Peculiarities in changing of hydrodynamical and hydrochemical modes of underground waters have been investigated. It is shown that prior to forming the sink only brines from the lower aquifer were entering into the mine in the course of nine months. The sink (caving) connected all suprasalt aquifers which resulted in quick filling of mined-out space with freshened brines. In the process of flooding of mine workings a depression funnel embracing virtually all aquifers was formed and was observed lowering of mineralization in underground waters. After restoring of drained water in the area of sinks' forming in the upper aquifers there is observed a total rise in the level of underground water and salinization with natural brines which testifies about ascending travel of water along the channels of sinks and zones of technogenic jointing and about the absence of fresh water inflow to saline rocks. Heightened concentration of hydrocarbonates is observed in water. At present no substantial changes in the condition (mode) of underground waters occurs. Head-capacity characteristics of suprasalt waters and mine brines exclude their mutual crossflows. It concludes that before water break into the mine workings their arrival can be detected only by hydrochemical performances of mine brine occurrence monitoring. Periods of hidden income suprasalt entrance to the mine can be significant. Their genetic identification is complicated by the small volume, composition, depending on the migration time and the structure of the waterproof formation, as well as mixing with miner brines of different origin. The development and execution of engineering activities on localization and repayment of hazardous mine brine occurences most likely and feasible in the initial period of existence of the latter.",2016,,Gorn.

1102,"Working on the levees: The rio grande rectification project, the civilian conservation corps, and the making of the US-Mexico border","Kropp, J.","The Rio Grande in the El Paso, Texas, US/Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, Valley has a long history of human use from prehistoric to modern times. Formal irrigation began in the 1600s, mainly for viticulture, changing to cotton and pecans in the 1900s. The Rio Grande was subject to bed shifting and flooding that, after 1848, affected the location of the international boundary. During the Great Depression the US and Mexican governments sponsored conservation projects to provide jobs and increase agricultural production. The Civilian Conservation Corps assisted with flood control and soil conservation work as part of the Rio Grande Rectification Project of 1933, the culmination of interstate and binational agreements to equitably divide water between the US and Mexico. Rectification permanently established the US-Mexico border in the valley, improved irrigation and flood control, and increased agricultural acreage along the river but led to soil salinization, water pollution, and strained a dwindling water supply. The project was a rare instance of bi-national cooperation in an otherwise acrimonious relationship. The environmental impact of the project led to further bi-national collaboration on environmental sustainability and infrastructure in the late twentieth century that continues today. © Common Ground Publishing, Mir Rabiul Islam, Valerie Ingham, John Hicks All Rights Reserved.",2016,,Int.

This study investigates the associations between agricultural productivity decrease, household poverty and the probability of out-migration in the Indian Sundarban Delta (ISD). Using newly collected survey data from randomly selected households within the ISD, we analysed these relationships by means of descriptive statistics and regression modeling. Results suggest the significant positive association between a decrease in agricultural productivity and out-migration. The results further show that ceteris paribus, out-migration is negatively associated with household poverty, which is likely to be explained by the effect of remittances.

1118,The ecohydrological challenge of woody-herbaceous transitions in the chaco-pampas plains,"Jobbágy, E.G.; Nosetto, M.D.; Santoni, C.S.; Baldi, G.","In sedimentary regions like the Chaco-Pampa plains, characterized by a very low regional topographic gradient (<0.1%), the networks of surface water and salt evacuation towards the ocean are poor and water excesses often translate into flooding and salt redistribution. Based on local and global experience we review the risks, challenges, and uncertainties opened by two vegetation transformations, dry forest replacement by agriculture and the conversion of grasslands to tree plantations, on the hydrological regulation and soil and water salinization of flat sedimentary landscapes. Evidence from dry forests, similar to those of the Espinal and Chaco, in Australia, Africa and North America suggests that their massive replacement by dryland crops causes water table level raises and salt transport towards the surface. These forests use precipitation inputs exhaustively, generating negligible deep drainage fluxes, being able to accumulate salts of atmospheric origin and those derived from rock weathering within their soils for millennia, and maintaining deep groundwater levels. The establishment of dryland agriculture generates strong deep drainage increases followed by gradual raises of groundwater level and the mobilization of salts that end affecting soil fertility at the regional scale after many decades, when water tables and the mobilized salts reach the surface. In the Espinal of Argentina we verified the negligible recharge typical of other dry forests and the storage of salts in the vadose zone (0.25 to 7 kg Cl-/m 2 from 0 to 6 m of depth) and their leaching following agricultural use of these lands. This process may be related to the flooding and salinization phenomena observed in the Chaco and Espinal. In subhumid grasslands, like those in the Pampas, water table levels are naturally close to the surface and groundwater redistributes salts towards the lowest landscape positions. The localized water balance shifts, imposed by tree plantations established in these grasslands alter groundwater dynamics through its consumption generating an intense water and soil salinization process. This negative impact takes place under subhumid climates where tree plantations are able to switch the net water flux between ecosystems and groundwater, and under mid to coarse textured sediments, capable of maintaining a good supply of water towards the afforested stands. Salinization increases when the tolerance of tree species is higher. The regional topography of the Chaco-Pampa plains would lead towards a strong effect of land use changes on vertical and horizontal groundwater and intense salt transport in an intense and hard to anticipate way. This hydrological vulnerability requires a better understanding and management of the water and salt cycles from an ecohydrological perspective and possess the challenge of developing an ""agronomy of water"" capable to contribute to the regulation of water table levels through management of both natural and cultivated ecosystems.",2008,,Ecol.

1122,Land degradation management in Southern Africa,"Msangi, J.P.","In all eight out of the ten countries constituting Southern Africa region most people live in rural areas and depend on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. In the region land degradation occurs mostly from soil erosion, chemical degradation (loss of nutrients, depletion of organic matter and acidification) and biological depletion. Other factors which contribute to land degradation in the region include compaction from overgrazing of rangelands, uncontrolled burning and improper cultivation of steep slopes, alternating flooding and crusting, salinization and pollution which all combine to cause degeneration of the fragile ecosystems covering large expanses of the region. Landscapes devoid of vegetative cover deeply incised by gullies that are difficult to reclaim, characterize large land expanses in the region classified as drylands. The portions classified as sub-humid or humid (highlands and wetlands) are prone to rapid soil loss from flash floods or periodic flooding. With a cycle of 2-3 and sometimes 5-6 years, droughts that have occurred in the region for over a century, worsen the land degradation problem making land management a formidable task particularly during the critical moisture deficient periods. Differing land tenure systems combined with high poverty and low literacy levels common among the rural population complicate land management process. Low technological capacity, poor governance, poorly conceived management policies and their implementation further complicate land management issues. Technology development, technology transfer and low adoption rates further exacerbate the situation. Pressure on the land and competition for land is of main concern throughout the region. Governments in the region as well as private organizations (including the numerous NGOs operating in the region), some communities and individuals (including researchers and academicians) have all identified the need to conserve land and reverse degradation to restore its productivity and improve the quality of life for those who depend on it for their livelihoods. The chapter examines the nature and causes of land degradation in the region, linking it to population characteristics, land ownership, low technological capacity, poverty, poor governance, low literacy and inappropriate land management practices. The chapter points out that numerous interventions targeted at reducing poverty and improvement in land resource management have not achieved their targets due to lack of coordination, rigidity and imposition which culminated in failure of the interveners to recognize and incorporate indigenous knowledge and peoples’ preferences and/or indigenous age-old land management strategies. Linkages to trade and unequal market access that encourages poverty and unwise use of the land resources are discussed. Adopting “people centered” interventions is recommended together with smart partnerships between the participating partners both from the north and those from the south. Solutions will largely depend on willingness to change and sharing information that will guide appropriate regional action. The region faces an enormous challenge part of which is to come up with viable solutions that will reverse the degradation of land and manage it sustainably. © 2017, Environmental Science and Engineering.

The last humid cycle started in 1970 with large flooding areas, a rise of the water-table, severe economic losses in the farming sector, environmental deterioration, and social problems. Biodrainage is a technique where vegetation is used to control excess water flow in the landscape by means of evapotranspiración. Good results have been reported in various countries in regard to efficient control of: flooding, soil salinization, and water-table rise. The plantation of forest species with bovine-cattle ranching (silvopastoral system) is recommended in areas of recharge abd transit to local groundwater flow systems and areas of transit to intermediate groundwater flow systems, and Tipie Udipsament, Tipic Ustipsament, Entic Hapludol, and Entic Haplustol soils. The annual profit by means of the annual forest rent and silvopastoral system is evaluated. Pinus taeda, Eucalyptus viminalis, and E. tereticornis, gave positive results. Prosopis sp and E. camaldulensis, appear to lack financial feasible. Prosopis sp could also be considered as it has good behaviour during the dry season, improves cattle ranching, and controls the water-table. A correct site selection to implant is essential; it should be selected based on the quality and quantity of the related groundwater flow system, which must be defined with proven scientific techniques. This way, the environmental problem of flooding in the northwest Bonoaerense is approached under a holistic vision of the physical and environmental geography. The importance of knowing the functioning of the landscape is highlighted, as well as the understanding of its dynamics, evolution, and relation with the physical, biological and human settings; such considerations are a must before proposing any environmental, economic and social practices that might prove to be sustainable.",2009,,Invest.

Conventional approach has assumed that as long as fractures are dry, their role in the hydrological cycle is negligible. This study, however, explores the processes occurring within surface-exposed fractures during the dry season, and shows that their role in hydrological and atmospheric cycles is not negligible. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group.",2009,,"Headwaters Ocean: Hydrol.

1146,Wetland vegetation - Hydrology co-evolution in response to rainfall variability,"Coletti, J.Z.; Vogwill, R.; Hipsey, M.R.","Nonlinear interactions between physical, chemical and biological factors determine the spatiotemporal extent of flooding, the level of salinisation and the vegetation dynamics in wetlands subjected to a certain climate signal. These interactions were studied using an ecohydrological model of a wetland in a semi-arid climate designed to account for the tolerance of vegetation functional groups to salinity and water availability. In particular, the model represents Melaleuca strobophylla and Casuarina obesa, as well as terrestrial short-rooted grasses, to represent those typically found in Lake Toolibin, a Ramsar appointed wetland of south-west Western Australian (SWWA). In a previous study, the model showed a good agreement when compared against available field data from Lake Toolibin. In this study, we explored specifically how variability in rainfall delivery can affect salt mobilization and subsequent vegetation abundance and assemblage. In order to test this, the model was tested under a range of rainfall intra-annual distribution with the same annual depth. Being particularly interested in semi-arid regions, the rainfall realisations were synthetically generated by a model previously calibrated to represent the precipitation typical of SWWA. The model demonstrated the co-evolution between hydrology and vegetation, as well as the non-linear responses of vegetation dynamics to climate forcing, both being strongly influenced by salinisation. A higher rainfall intensity enhanced runoff, raised the water table level and decreased salt leaching, intensifying accumulation of salt in the root zone. This altered salt mobilization affected vegetation abundance, water uptake and significantly changed to the vegetation assemblage. The short-rooted, terrestrial-adapted C. obesa benefited from a rainfall signal that was more evenly distributed over the year, while M. strobophylla benefited from more intense rainfall events that cause water to pond for prolonged periods. This exercise highlighted the fact that salinity amplifies the impact of climate variability, significantly affecting both the overall vegetation density and assemblage. This fact reinforces the need to include salinisation processes within ecohydrological models used to study vegetation dynamics in semi-arid regions. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.",2013,,"Proc. - Int.

1147,Quantifying rainfall and flooding impacts on groundwater levels in irrigation areas: GIS approach,"Khan, S.; Ahmad, A.; Wang, B.","Landscapes continuously irrigated without proper drainage for a long period of time frequently experience a rise in water-table levels. Waterlogging and salinization of irrigated areas are immediate impacts of this situation in arid areas, especially when groundwater salinity is high. Flooding and heavy rainfall further recharge groundwater and accelerate these impacts. An understanding of regional groundwater dynamics is required to implement land and water management strategies. The purpose of this study is to quantify the impact of flood and rain events on spatial scales using a geographic information system (GIS). This paper presents a case study of shallow water-table levels and salinity problems in the Wakool irrigation district located in the Murray irrigation area with groundwater average electrical conductivity greater than 25 μS/cm. This area has experienced several large flood events during the past several decades. Piezometric data are interpolated to generate a water-table surface for each event by applying the Kriging method of spatial interpolation using the linear variogram model. Spatial and temporal analysis of major flood events over the last four decades is conducted using calculated water-table surfaces to quantify the change in groundwater storage and shallow water-table levels. The drainage impact of a subsurface drainage scheme partially covering the area has also been quantified in this paper. The results show that flooding and local rainfall have a significant impact on shallow groundwater. The study also found that postflood climatic conditions (evaporation and rainfall) play a significant role in the groundwater dynamics of the area. The spatial net average groundwater recharge during the flooding events ranges from 0.19 to 0.52 ML/ha. The GIS-based techniques described in this paper can be used for net recharge estimation in semiarid regions where it is important to quantify net recharge impacts of regional flooding and local rainfall. The spatial visualization of the net recharge in a GIS environment can help prioritize management actions by local communities. © 2007 ASCE.",2007,,J. Irrig. Drain.

At vegetative stage (55-65 DAS), plants were exposed to single saline irrigation (Cl- dominated) of levels, i.e. 0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 dSm-1 and sampled after 3 days. The other set of treated plants was desalinized by flooding and the plants were sampled after 3 days. Water potential (ψw) of leaf and Osmotic potential (ψs) of roots significantly decreased from -0.44 to -0.56 MPa and from -0.56 to -0.96 MPa, respectively with increasing the level of salinity stress. RWC of leaf and roots also reduced from 7-13% to 3-6%, respectively. The decline (more -ve) in ψs of roots was mainly due to accumulation of proline and total soluble carbohydrates (20-76%). The increase in ethylene evolution was 211% and corresponding increase in ACC content and ACC oxidase activity was also observed. Marked increase in H2O2 (50-89%) and lipid peroxidation (13-224%) induced defense mechanism in roots was indicated by the increased activity of antioxygenic enzymes, i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione transferase (GTase). Ascorbic acid content showed reduction from 16% to 26%. About 3.5-fold increase in Na +/K+ ratio and about 1.5-2.0 fold increase in Cl - content was observed. Upon desalinization a partial recovery of metabolic process was observed at 5.0 and 10.0 dSm-1 levels of salinity. The decrease in functional efficiency of chickpea roots was due to overproduction of C2H4, increase in H2O 2 content, Na+/K+ ratio and Cl- content along with decrease in water status and ascorbic acid content. 3 days period after desalinization was not sufficient for complete recovery. It is suggested that ethylene evolution under salinization and desalinization conditions plays a key role in the functioning of chickpea roots.",2006,,Physiol. Mol. Biol.

The river hydrology has been modifed and the daily tidal flooding has become seasonal when the dam fills with fresh water. Acid sulphate soils, formed during a period of oxidation are affected by salinization, the degree of influence depending on their location with regard to the old riverbed. Upstream, groundwater has different chemical compositions distributed according to its concentration level. It is sulphate, aluminous and ferrous when water is diluted close to the valley edge whereas it bears chloride and sodium in the more concentrated water in the central part of the valley. A study of thermodynamics equilibria shows that, during concentration and precipitation of aluminium sulphate, a sulphate groundwater becomes chloride. If such a process occurs during a lateral transfer of groundwater, we can observe a spatial distribution of the different types of groundwater.

1164,Climate change effects on the water supply in some major river basins,"Muttiah, R.S.; Wurbs, R.A.","While the Green Revolution during the latter part of the 20th century may have been facilitated by higher-yield grain varieties, the impact of increased water harvesting techniques (dams, irrigation systems) on agricultural production cannot be ignored. The promotion of agriculture to sequester carbon will require the careful evaluation of future water availability. The following are widely thought to impact the water cycle in a future climate: (1) greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, are expected to increase from human related activities such as fuel emission and fertilizer application; (2) air and sea surface temperatures (SST) will rise due to GHGs; (3) the number of extreme events (flooding, drought, tornados due to SST-related El Niño/Southern Oscillation [ENSO] events) precipitation intensity may increase, that is, the wet periods will get wetter and the dry periods will get drier; (4) the quality of arable land may decline due to increased salinization, erosion, and poor management; and (5) urban population growth will continue at or above current rates. Iraq serves as an example of point 4. While about 3.5 million ha are potentially cultivable in irrigated agriculture, roughly half, 1.94 million ha, are actually cultivated due to water logging and salinization problems (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 1997). Recent extreme events from the late 1990s to the present - such as the flooding of the Elbe in Central Europe in August 2002, the 1998 flooding of the Yangzte in China, the 2000 and 2002 droughts in monsoondependent India, and the highest recorded tornado activity in the United States in 2003 - are visible signs of potential trends in extreme events.

To estimate potential and actual ecological danger caused by secondary salinization of soils under the influence of the mine waters from technical reservoirs located in West part of the Donets Basin. Methodology. The estimation of the soils' state was made by means of the following methods: field methods applied for study of anthropogenic deformed soil systems and for the determination of the negative influence of waste water on the halochemical state of soils (sampling was made by the standard 'envelope' method); laboratory methods applied for determination of the chemical compound of soil, its biological activity and pollution indicators (spectrophotometer analysis of mineralization of samples of water and water extracts from the soil samples and potentiometer analysis of an active acidity). As a result the classification and general characteristic of the negative consequences of coal mining in general and for the West part of the Donets Basin in particular were presented. The results of estimation of water mineralization in the gathering pond ""Svidovok"" were received. Hydrochemical type of the water was determined.

In September 1999, a large magnitude storm surge inundated low-lying areas of the outer Mackenzie Delta. The storm was among the most intense on record and resulted in the highest water levels ever measured at the delta front. Synthesis of scientific and Inuvialuit knowledge indicates that flooding during the 1999 storm surge increased soil salinity and caused widespread vegetation death. Vegetation cover was significantly reduced in areas affected by the surge and was inversely related to soil salinity. Change detection analysis, using remotely sensed imagery bracketing the 1999 storm event, indicates severe impacts on at least 13 200 ha of terrestrial vegetation in the outer delta. Inuvialuit knowledge identifying the 1999 surge as anomalous is corroborated by geochemical profiles of permafrost and by a recently published paleo-environmental study, which indicates that storm surge impacts of this magnitude have not previously occurred during the last millennium. Almost a decade after the 1999 storm surge event, ecological recovery has been minimal. This broad-scale vegetation change is likely to have significant implications for wildlife and must be considered in regional ecosystem planning and in the assessment and monitoring of the cumulative impacts of development. Our investigations show that Inuvialuit were aware of the 1999 storm surge and the environmental impacts several years before the scientific and regulatory communities recognized their significance.

The dynamics of deltas are governed by changes in river discharge and reworking of sediment. While these dynamics make deltas highly productive areas, they also present challenges to farming practices, often resulting in complicated feedbacks. These dynamics include river and coastal flooding, compaction, subsidence, salinization, and moving land-water boundaries.

This study investigates into the parametric analysis on saltwater intrusion in a conceptual, coastal, unconfined aquifer considering wide range of freshwater draft and anticipated sea level rise. The saltwater intrusion under various circumstances is simulated through parametric studies using MODFLOW, MT3DMS and SEAWAT. The MODFLOW is used to simulate the groundwater flow system under changing hydro-dynamics in coastal aquifer. To simulate solute transport MT3DMS and SEAWAT is used. The saltwater intrusion process has direct bearing on hydraulic conductivity and inversely related to porosity. It may also be noted that increase in recharge rate considered in the study does not have much influence on saltwater intrusion. Effect of freshwater draft at locations beyond half of the width of the aquifer considered has marginal effect and hence can be considered as safe zone for freshwater withdrawals. Due to the climate change effect, the anticipated rise in sea level of 0.88 m over a century is considered in the investigation. This causes increase in salinity intrusion by about 25%.

The saltwater intrusion occurred twice a month to varying extents, with each saltwater intrusion happening 1-3 days before spring tide, and the stronger saltwater intrusion always occurred at the beginning of the month. Our model results show that caused by a long-term northerly wind during the dry season, the increased steady shear term in the salt transport flux were responsible for the abnormally strong saltwater intrusion in the Humen Channel.

1205,"Saltwater Intrusion Function and Preliminary Application in the Yangtze River Estuary, China","Xu, Z; Ma, J; Hu, YJ","More attention has been paid to saltwater-intrusion-related problems in recent years. In this research study, a saltwater intrusion function in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) was constructed based on the theory of the interactions between energy accumulation and impedance. A MIKE21 model was used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the YRE. Then, through the analysis of the relationships between the river discharge conditions, tidal ranges, and saltwater intrusion, it was determined that, under certain river discharge conditions, the tidal ranges and salinity levels at the stations in the southern branch (SB) of the YRE conformed to S-shaped curve characteristics. Also, the tidal ranges and salinity excessive area rate (SEAR) displayed similar characteristics. Furthermore, the river discharge conditions were also found to match the S-curve characteristics between the two aforementioned relationship features. Therefore, the saltwater intrusion function of the YRE was constructed based on the previously mentioned development rules. Also, the applied quantification methods were elaborated, and the values of the parameters were determined. As a result, the critical river discharge (more than 10,000 m(3)/s) was obtained, which could withstand large-scale saltwater intrusions. When the river discharge was greater than 30,000 m(3)/s, the area was considered to be basically without salt water intrusions, and the estuarine ecology was in an optimal state. The saltwater intrusion losses from 2005 to 2015 are also calculated.

In addition to inundating low-lying areas near the coast and increasing the frequency of flooding, sea level rise may raise the groundwater table, drive saltwater intrusion, and increase the risk for erosion and scour. These impacts represent key equilibrium shifts that will affect geotechnical site conditions and design parameters. Frequent inundation will likely increase the demand for floodable, elevated, and floating foundation systems; frequent flooding of roads may reduce the service life of pavements and erode unbound subgrade material. Groundwater rise will increase hydrostatic pressures on earth retaining structures and foundations and may complicate construction projects requiring excavation. The threat of saltwater intrusion will encourage innovative strategies for developing hydraulic barriers. Increased erosion may reduce the longevity of beach nourishment projects and increase the rate of scour around infrastructure.

1214,Impacts of morphological change and sea-level rise on stratification in the Pearl River Estuary,"Ma, MY; Zhang, WY; Chen, W; Deng, JJ; Schrum, C","The Pearl River Delta (PRD), where several megacities are located, has undergone drastic morphological changes caused by anthropogenic impact during the past few decades. In its main estuary, the water area has been reduced by 21% whilst the average water depth has increased by 2.24 m from 1970s to 2010s. The mainly human-induced morphological change together with sea level rise has jointly led to a remarkable change in the water stratification. However, the spatial and temporal variability of stratification in the estuary and associated driving mechanisms remain less understood. In this study, stratification in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in response to morphological change and external forcing is investigated by 3-dimensional numerical modeling. Simulation results indicate that stratification in the PRE exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variabilities. At a tidal-to-monthly time scale, variation of stratification is mainly driven by advection and straining through tidal forcing. At a monthly-to-seasonal scale, monsoon-driven river runoff and associated plume and fronts dominate the variation of stratification. Human-induced morphological change leads to an enhancement of stratification by up to four times in the PRE. Compared to an overwhelming human impact in the past few decades, future sea level rise would further enhance stratification, but to a much lesser extent than past human impacts. In addition, stratification in different areas of the estuary also responds differently to the driving factors. The western shoal of the estuary is most sensitive to changes in morphology and sea level due to its shallowness, followed by the channels and other parts of the estuary, which are less sensitive.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000933468600001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1072080,,#17238,Ma 2023,,

Specifically, for flux-controlled unconfined coastal systems, the toe response distance driven by SLR is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers. Using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity (derived based on the initial interface toe location before SLR) would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance, depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers. For flux-controlled confined layered coastal systems, by contrast, SLR can not cause variation of the steady-state interface toe location, which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers. The interface toe location in head-controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers. Moreover, the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux-controlled coastal system, as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux. The results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of SLR on SWI, which could provide a first-order assessment tool for relevant practitioners.",2018,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,563,,851-862,WOS:000441492700068,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.06.046,,#17267,Shi 2018,,
1221,Impacts of sea-level rise on coastal zones of Mauritius: insights following calculation of a coastal vulnerability index,"Beeharry, YD; Bekaroo, G; Bokhoree, C; Phillips, MR","Whilst climate change has been regarded as a growing concern in recent years due the disruptive and detrimental effects experienced across the globe, one of its most compelling and threatening evidence is Sea Level Rise (SLR). This phenomenon is more prominent in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and such islands are already facing escalating associated environmental threats, causing social and economic disruptions as well as insecurities. Amongst the SIDS, the coastal areas of Mauritius are considered among the most vulnerable to SLR, where statistics showed that between the years 1987 and 2007, an annual increase of 2.1 mm in the sea level has been observed around Mauritius. Although SLR has various associated impacts, limited work has been undertaken to assess the coastal vulnerability of the impacts of SLR for Mauritius and to compute the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) of the island. Taking cognizance of this limitation, the purpose of this paper is to quantify, prioritize and critically assess the vulnerability of key impacts of sea level rise on the coastal areas of Mauritius following computation of a CVI. In this process, five key research questions are answered towards calculating the CVI of the island to eventually conceptualize a framework with the aim to reduce the adverse impacts of SLR on coastal zones of Mauritius. Findings of this study aim at the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability of coastal areas to the impacts of SLR.",2022,,NATURAL HAZARDS,114,1,27-55,WOS:000825174200001,10.1007/s11069-022-05378-9,,#17270,Beeharry 2022,,
1223,Impacts of inland boundary conditions on modeling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers due to sea-level rise,"Sun, DM; Niu, SX; Zang, YG","Inland boundary conditions have significant impacts on seawater intrusion (SWI) due to sea-level rise (SLR). This study investigated the impacts of three inland boundary conditions (flux-controlled (FC), head-controlled (HC) and general-head boundary (GHB)) on modeling SWI due to SLR in coastal aquifers. First, we used the TOUGH2/EOS7 software program to solve the standard Henry's problem and compared the results with those from the literatures. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the impacts of the three inland boundary conditions on SWI induced by SLR in confined coastal aquifers (standard Henry's problem) and unconfined coastal aquifers (Henry's problem extended to unconfined domains). The simulation results show that HC systems in both confined and unconfined coastal aquifers are remarkably vulnerable to the effects of SLR owing to the resulting decreased head difference, while FC systems are relatively insensitive to SLR because the equivalent freshwater head at the inland boundary can increase by a similar magnitude to the SLR. The GHB boundary is more realistic than the other two boundary conditions: the recharge decreases because of SLR depending on the aquifer properties and the head difference between the reference head and the equivalent freshwater head at the seaside boundary.",2017,,NATURAL HAZARDS,88,1,145-163,WOS:000405328100008,10.1007/s11069-017-2860-0,,#17285,Sun 2017,,

In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and salinity transport model, with a high resolution unstructured mesh and spatially varying bottom roughness, is applied to quantify the influences of SLR on saline water intrusion in the YRE. The model has well been validated through observation data of tidal level, flow velocity and direction, and salinity. The performances of four scenarios of the present sea level (PSL) as well as 0.5, I and 2 m SLR reveal that (1) the isohaline shifts upstream nonlinearly in the YRE with SLR, and non-uniform in the spatial distribution under the same SLR. The isohalines of 1, 2 and 5 psu near the north bank of the South Branch intrude farther upstream than those near the south bank, and the upstream advance distance of 0.45 psu isohaline is much longer than those of 1,2 and 5 psu isohalines under the same SLR. (2) The spillover of saline water from the North Branch into the South Branch intensifies with SLR, while the salinity in the lower reach of the North Branch is reduced due to increased low salinity flow from the South Branch and the North Channel caused by SLR. (3) The durations of undrinkable water increase at four reservoirs with SLR, and four reservoirs cannot intake raw drinking-water in the dry season in the 2 m SLR scenario. (4) A regression analysis obtains a quantitative quadratic expression between salinity and SLR. Finally, the effects of the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir and more SLR scenarios on the salinity, and two different approaches for SLR simulations are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1225,Impacts of Coastal Shrimp Ponds on Saltwater Intrusion and Submarine Groundwater Discharge,"Hou, YX; Yang, J; Russoniello, CJ; Zheng, TY; Wu, ML; Yu, X","Shrimp aquaculture has expanded rapidly in coastal zones worldwide over the past few decades. Saline water stored in shrimp farm ponds can infiltrate into the underlying aquifer causing groundwater salinization and increased submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal water. However, little research has assessed salinization resulting from these shrimp ponds. To understand the impacts of shrimp farm irrigation on groundwater salinization and SGD, we numerically simulated a series of aquaculture management scenarios in a two-dimensional conceptual coastal aquifer using a coupled surface-subsurface approach. We characterized sensitivities to pond water salinity, pond water depth, and farm width. Salinization was assessed by three indicators (salinized area, infiltrated salt mass, and recovery rate), and three SGD indicators were evaluated (fresh SGD, saline SGD, and saltwater circulation rate). Our results show that pond water depth is the primary control on the mass of saltwater infiltration while farm width is the primary control for recovery rate. Pond water salinity and depth affect both fresh and saline SGD. We show that aquaculture is a previously unrecognized mechanism of salinization affecting coastal aquifer vulnerability and SGD. A regional graphical information system analysis shows transformation into aquacultural ponds could introduce considerable SGD variability spatially and temporally. These findings will enable coastal managers to better evaluate groundwater vulnerability in regions with expanding onshore aquaculture and demonstrates the impact of aquaculture on coastal groundwater resources and the need for further study to understand the impact of aquaculture across Asia and the globe.",2022,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,58,7,,WOS:000823072900001,10.1029/2021WR031866,,#17290,Hou 2022,,

We conducted field mesocosm experiments in the Florida Everglades, USA to test the effects of saltwater intrusion on periphyton metabolism, nutrient content, and diatom species composition, and how these responses differ between mats from a freshwater versus a brackish marsh. Pulsed saltwater intrusion was simulated by dosing treatment chambers monthly with a brine solution for 15months; control chambers were simultaneously dosed with site water. Periphyton from the freshwater marsh responded to a 1-ppt increase in surface water salinity with reduced productivity and decreased concentrations of total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These functional responses were accompanied by significant shifts in periphytic diatom assemblages. Periphyton mats at the brackish marsh were more functionally resilient to the saltwater treatment (similar to 2ppt above ambient), but nonetheless experienced significant shifts in diatom composition. These findings suggest that freshwater periphyton is negatively affected by small, short-term increases in salinity and that periphytic diatom assemblages, particularly at the brackish marsh, are a better metric of salinity increases compared with periphyton functional metrics due to functional redundancy. This research provides new and valuable information regarding periphyton dynamics in response to changing water sources in the southern Everglades that will allow us to extend the use of periphyton, and their diatom assemblages, as tools for environmental assessments related to saltwater intrusion.",2018,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,41,7,2105-2119,WOS:000445240600018,10.1007/s12237-018-0415-6,,#17292,Mazzei 2018,,
1237,The impact of aquifer stratification on saltwater intrusion characteristics. Comprehensive laboratory and numerical study,"Etsias, G; Hamill, GA; Aguila, JF; Benner, EM; McDonnell, MC; Ahmed, AA; Flynn, R","Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were utilized in this study to assess the impact of aquifer stratification on saltwater intrusion. Three homogeneous and six layered aquifers were investigated. Image processing algorithms facilitated the precise calculation of saltwater wedge toe length, width of the mixing zone, and angle of intrusion. It was concluded that the length of intrusion in stratified aquifers is predominantly a function of permeability contrast, total aquifer transmissivity and the number of heterogeneous layers, being positively correlated to all three. When a lower permeability layer overlays or underlays more permeable zones its mixing zone widens, while it becomes thinner for the higher permeability strata. The change in the width of the mixing zone (WMZ) is positively correlated to permeability contrast, while it applies to all strata irrespectively of their relative vertical position in the aquifer. Variations in the applied hydraulic head causes the transient widening of WMZ. These peak WMZ values are larger during saltwater retreat and are negatively correlated to the layer's permeability and distance from the aquifer's bottom. Moreover, steeper angles of intrusion are observed in cases where low permeability layers overlay more permeable strata, and milder ones in the inverse aquifer setups. The presence of a low permeability upper layer results in the confinement of the saltwater wedge in the lower part of the stratified aquifer. This occurs until a critical hydraulic head difference is applied to the system. This hydraulic gradient value was found to be a function of layer width and permeability contrast alike.",2021,,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,35,4,,WOS:000645220700034,10.1002/hyp.14120,,#17338,Etsias 2021,,

Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.",2017,,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,31,4,981-991,WOS:000399692500010,10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7,,#17346,Zhou 2017,,

Early detection of regime shift due to salinity stress in vegetation may facilitate conservation efforts. It has been shown that the O-18 value of water in the xylem of trees can be used as a surrogate for salinity in the rooting zone of plants. Coupling measured O-18 values in the tree xylem with simulated O-18 values in trees and salinity in the vadose zone can be used to investigate competitive responses of glycophytic versus halophytic trees. MANTRA-O18 simulations suggest that the impacts of salinization on diminishing the resilience of salinity-intolerant trees can be detected up to 25years before the glycophytic trees are threatened with regime shift to halophytic species. This early detection provides critical lead time and valuable information and insights useful for planning adaptation strategy to mitigate against the adverse impacts of sea level rise and climate change.",2019,,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,27,4,1257-1276,WOS:000468592900009,10.1007/s10040-019-01930-3,,#17354,Teh 2019,,
1242,Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization on Groundwater Resources in a Barrier Island,"Chang, SW; Nemec, K; Kalin, L; Clement, TP","Coastal freshwater aquifers are highly vulnerable to climate change and other anthropogenic environmental impacts. Therefore, managing coastal freshwater for future use requires critical planning. This is especially true for small barrier islands where, in most cases, groundwater could be the only freshwater resource. In this study, the combined effects of climate change, land-use changes, and increased groundwater pumping on freshwater resources of a barrier island were studied. A case study was completed using the field data available for Dauphin Island, a small barrier island located in Alabama, U.S., and by using the simulation data generated from multiple water-resource-management models. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulations provided recharge estimates under various future land use/land cover and climate-change scenarios. Downscaled global circulation model provided precipitation and temperature patterns for the period 2011-2030. The recharge estimates from SWAT were then used as input in a numerical groundwater model to evaluate saltwater-intrusion effects and forecast the changes in freshwater storage within the island aquifer system. Various groundwater-management scenarios were simulated using the MODFLOW-family computer code SEAWAT to assess the sensitivity of the groundwater system to increased pumping rates and decreased recharge due to climate change and/or future developments. SEAWAT was used to predict the lateral saltwater-intrusion effects and its impacts on groundwater quality and freshwater volume. The simulation results show that the saltwater wedge would advance laterally under all future climate-change scenarios. These results indicate that the shallow unconfined aquifer might not be able to sustain any significant future population growth, especially under adverse climate-change conditions. Analysis of changes in the volume of freshwater lens provided a broader understanding of the coupled effects of climatic and anthropogenic changes on freshwater storage and this information can be used to better manage Dauphin Island's unconfined groundwater system.

Marine inundation of these ecosystems would result in significant ecological changes. We elucidated effects of changing levels of marine influence to lake ecosystems by exploring the ontogeny of coastal Greiner Lake in Arctic Canada. Using paleolimnological methods on a sediment core, we explored functional assemblage compositions of aquatic biota (diatoms and chironomids), biomarkers (pigments and fatty acids) and geochemistry (stable isotopes and organic matter) throughout the isolation history of the lake. The biological and geological data collectively indicated a paleoenvironmental shift from marine embayment to brackish lagoon in the Late-Holocene and to a freshwater lake ca. 500 BP. We observed that the lake was most productive during a phase of mixed freshwater and marine influence, based on higher chlorophyll-a and beta,beta-carotene concentrations, omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3) as well as sediment organic content. We suggest that, in addition to reorganization of aquatic communities and altered ecosystem services provided by coastal lakes, coastal freshwaters may become more productive under increasing marine influence caused by climate change.

The proposed methodology considers coastal regions under geological heterogeneity and it is tested on a groundwater system in Nassau County of Long Island, New York (USA). The numerical model is constructed with the SEAWAT code. The parameter uncertainty of this model is evaluated by coupling the Latin hypercube sampling method (as a sampling algorithm) and Monte Carlo simulation to consider the uncertainty in both hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate. The indices are presented in spatial maps that classify areas of risk to potential threats. The results show that two of the water districts have a high risk under conditions of decreasing groundwater level. Salinity occurs in the southern and southwestern parts of the Nassau County aquifer and a considerable area of high risk of SWI is identified. Furthermore, the average SGD rate with the associated fluxes of nitrate is estimated as 81.4 million m(3)/year (average 0.8 tons of nitrate through SGD per year), which can adversely affect the quality of life in the local coastal ecosystems.

However, we lack the ability to predict detailed vegetation responses, especially for saline pulses that are more realistic in nature than permanent saline presses. In this study, we exposed common freshwater and brackish plants to different durations (1-31days per month for 3months) of saline water (salinity of 5). We found that Zizaniopsis miliacea was more tolerant to salinity than the other two freshwater species, Polygonum hydropiperoides and Pontederia cordata. We also found that Zizaniopsis miliacea belowground and total biomass appeared to increase with salinity pulses up to 16days in length, although this relationship was quite variable. Brackish plants, Spartina cynosuroides, Schoenoplectus americanus and Juncus roemerianus, were unaffected by the experimental treatments. Our experiment did not evaluate how competitive interactions would further affect responses to salinity but our results suggest the hypothesis that short pulses of saline water will increase the cover of Zizaniopsis miliacea and decrease the cover of Polygonum hydropiperoides and Pontederia cordata in tidal freshwater marshes, thereby reducing diversity without necessarily affecting total plant biomass.",2018,,WETLANDS,38,5,885-891,WOS:000450305300003,10.1007/s13157-018-1037-2,,#17379,Li 2018,,

The structure of these new aquatic communities is jointly controlled by pre- and post-colonization processes. Similarly, since salinity is a strong abiotic determinant of post-colonization survival in coastal systems, changes in salinity will likely impact community composition. In this study, we examine how a strong abiotic gradient affects the diversity and structure of bacterial and zooplankton communities and associated ecosystem functions (decomposition and carbon mineralization). We ran a six week dispersal experiment using mesocosm ponds with four distinct salinity profiles (0, 5, 9, and 13 psu). We find that salinity is the primary driver of both bacterial and zooplankton community composition. We find evidence that as bacterial richness increases so does the amount of decomposition. A phenomenological model suggests carbon mineralization may decrease at mid-salinities; this warrants future work into possible mechanisms for this apparent loss of function.

Collected data show that thousands of metric tons of salt were advected through the channel into coastal wetlands during each event, which lasted up to 4days. The results reveal that as much as 36% of advected salts accumulated in the wetlands, suggesting that the cumulative effects of these events on the health of coastal wetlands in the Albemarle system may be substantial due to the abundance of constructed channels and the frequency of wind-driven tidal events.

1265,"Mechanisms, configuration typology, and vulnerability of pumping-induced seawater intrusion in heterogeneous aquifers","Yu, X; Michael, HA","Coastal aquifers are vulnerable to seawater intrusion due to excessive groundwater pumping. Most research on salinization vulnerability considers homogeneous aquifers, forming the basis of management guidance. However, geologic structure can be highly heterogeneous, with preferential flow paths and low-permeability barriers that complicate flow and salt transport processes under pumping conditions. Here we use a series of variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport models with geostatistical representations of heterogeneity to illustrate characteristics of vulnerability in heterogeneous and homogeneous aquifers. Simulations showed that in homogeneous aquifers, salinization patterns were simple and related only to the hydraulic properties. In heterogeneous aquifers, salinization rates and patterns were much more complicated, and related to pumping location and depth, aquifer geometry, and geologic connections between pumping location, landward boundaries, and saline groundwater. An intrusion configuration typology approach was developed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers. The configuration approach was applied to heterogeneous aquifers of low, medium, and high geologic continuity, and vulnerability was assessed. The probability-based assessment was able to characterize the impact of pumping locations and rates in heterogeneous aquifers, considering different types of intrusion. The results showed that groundwater vulnerability to salinization was sensitive to pumping distance to the coastline for low-continuity aquifers and to pumping depth for high-continuity aquifers. The analysis provides new insights into the relationship between land-sea geologic connections and seawater intrusion vulnerability. The configuration approach plus probability-based assessment can be a starting point for large-scale aquifer characterization and more sophisticated groundwater management, including vulnerability assessment and optimization of pumping location, depth, and rate.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,128,,117-128,WOS:000468138400010,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.04.013,,#17449,Yu 2019,,

During the spring tide in the dry season, the peak velocity during the ebb tide in the North Channel will be reduced by 13%, while it will be increased by 21% in the South Channel in average. The salinity will be increased in the North Channel, while reduced in the South Passage, besides, the reclamation project will aggravate the saltwater intrusion of the North Branch. The value of N/P will be increased by about 4% in the whole South Branch except for the North Channel, leading to a slight aggravation of the phosphorus restriction effect in the Yangtze Estuary.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS,31,3,603-613,WOS:000473434100017,10.1007/s42241-019-0006-4,,#17467,Cao 2019,,
1272,"Application of habitat evaluation procedure for impact assessment studies in Laguna de Bay, Philippines","Bongco, IG; Santos-Borja, AC; Nauta, TA","The assessment of the Laguna de Bay's changing ecological status is imperative in order to address the growing concern of its possible impact on the suitability of the lake to the various user functions and future demands. The innovative use of a water quality evaluation method through the application of the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) can support ecological impact studies in Laguna de Bay. The scenarios studied included among others: waste load inputs, saltwater intrusion, deepening of the Pasig River, sea level rise and the impact of a special project on the development of large polder islands in the lake. Comparisons of the present condition, with autonomous development and with management intervention were made. The results of the study on the scenarios with autonomous development revealed that the lake, particularly at the western part of the West Bay, will continue to deteriorate if no measures are undertaken to control pollution due to a projected increase in human population and industrial expansion. Assessment results with management intervention indicated that a projected polder island scenario with a sewage plan expanded from two municipalities to four municipalities and with channel deepening seems to be the best management alternative that would significantly improve the suitability of the lake for various user functions.",2003,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,506,1-3,811-817,WOS:000188455600105,10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008599.71810.b8,,#17475,Bongco 2003,,

Our knowledge of fungal community assembly in these compartments is limited, especially in wetlands. We tested the hypothesis that biotic factors would have direct effects on rhizosphere and endosphere assembly, while abiotic factors would have direct and indirect effects. Using a field study, we examined the influences of salinity, water level and biotic factors on baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) fungal communities. We found that endosphere fungi, unlike rhizosphere fungi, were correlated with host density and canopy cover, suggesting that hosts can impose selective filters on fungi colonizing their roots. Meanwhile, local abiotic conditions strongly influenced both rhizosphere and endosphere diversity in opposite patterns, e.g. highest endosphere diversity (hump-shaped) and lowest rhizosphere diversity (U-shaped) at intermediate salinity levels. These results indicate that the assembly and structure of the root endosphere and rhizosphere within a host can be shaped by different processes. Our results also highlight the importance of assessing how environmental changes affect plant and plant-associated fungal communities in wetland ecosystems where saltwater intrusion and sea level rise are major threats to both plant and fungal communities.",2020,,FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,96,7,,WOS:000565899500022,10.1093/femsec/fiaa124,,#17477,Lumibao 2020,,

An aquifer is investigated using both GALDIT and DRASTIC indices. The GALDIT model is developed to determine the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in terms of saltwater intrusion whereas the DRASTIC model is generally applicable to all aquifers. Having compared the results of both the GALDIT and DRASTIC models with quality parameters, the salinity model proved to be more appropriate in identifying the vulnerability of coastal aquifers.

In this study, a combined experimental-computational method is developed to explore the effect of seawater concentration on the elevation of groundwater table and the rate of saltwater intrusion, while the lake water level is dropping. At the laboratory tank scale, we have collected experimental data by varying the saltwater concentration by 2.0 and 2.5 times its initial value while measuring the height of the groundwater table. Our simulation has shown an unexpected increase in height of groundwater by 5.0 and 13.0% relative to the head difference at the boundaries of the domain. Also, the intrusion rate of saltwater wedge increased by 2.0 and 3.0 times, respectively. We have used the verified model for a field state and found that if density variations are neglected in simulation, the calculated groundwater level is affected more than 2 times in response to fluctuation of lake water level (relative to simulations by including the effect of fluid density changes). Based on the results density variations can counteract; even reverse, the effect of water table changes. Remarkably, our simulations have shown that despite a severe decrease in the water level of a saline lake over time, the saltwater wedge has indeed intruded further because of the substantial increase in the density of the lake water due to the rising salinity. Based on the findings, to reach a reasonable result in the study of interaction between saline water of shrinking lakes with coastal groundwater, saltwater concentration as well as saline water density in the modeling must be considered.",2022,,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,36,11,4057-4080,WOS:000826820300001,10.1007/s11269-022-03236-8,,#17487,Motallebian 2022,,
1277,Salt intrusion at a submarine spring in a fringing reef lagoon,"Parra, SM; Valle-Levinson, A; Marino-Tapia, I; Enriquez, C","Variations in discharge and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) were studied at a point-source submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), within a fringing reef lagoon, from quadrature (neap) to syzygy (spring) tides. The principal factors affecting discharge and TKE variations were tides and waves. Field data indicated discharge, and TKE varied with high and low tides, and with quadrature and syzygy. Maximum discharge and TKE values were observed during low tides when the hydrostatic pressure over the jet was minimal, while the lowest discharge and TKE values were found at high tides. Syzygy tides produced consistent saltwater intrusion during high tides, while quadrature tides produced the greatest TKE values. In general, as the discharge intensified during low tides, jet temperatures decreased suggesting that waters originated further within the aquifer. At the same time jet salinities increased, suggesting a mixing of aquifer and seawater. To reconcile these two seemingly opposing views, it is proposed that the jet conduit is connected to a stratified chamber with seawater below brackish water. The greatest subtidal discharge occurred during quadrature tides. Syzygy produced low subtidal discharge driven by flow reversals (flow into the aquifer) observed throughout syzygy high tides in conjunction with the peak wave setup (>5 cm) observed during a storm. While tides were the primary driving force of the discharge, waves played a nonnegligible role. Wave effects on the discharge were most evident during syzygy high tides combined with a storm, when the subtidal spring discharge was weakest and salt intrusion developed.",2015,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,120,4,2736-2750,WOS:000354417200020,10.1002/2014JC010459,,#17492,Parra 2015,,
1281,"The coastal aquifer recovery subject to storm surge: Effects of connected heterogeneity, physical barrier and surge frequency","Song, J; Yang, Y; Wu, JF; Wu, JC","Storm surge, a worldwide phenomenon triggering the vertical saltwater infiltration, is likely to exacerbate coastal groundwater salinization due to geologic heterogeneity, anthropogenic engineering and climate change. This study analyzed the combined effects of connected heterogeneity, physical barrier and surge frequency on the coastal aquifer recovery. A series of modeling cases were investigated using HydroGeoSphere in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer. The heterogeneity setting is composed of different connectivity level of hydraulic conductivity field. The simulation results of single storm surge event demonstrate that the connected heterogeneity elevates the salinized extent and reduces the aquifer recovery time due to a number of preferential flow paths. In comparison to the equivalent homogeneous aquifer, heterogeneity alleviates the maximum salinized extent and vertical intrusion distance due to the accelerated mixing of salinized groundwater with fresh groundwater. Physical barrier, classified as subsurface dam and cutoff wall, leading to different groundwater discharge pattern is tailored to investigate the influences of the permanent subsurface engineering on the aquifer recovery. Our results show that the connectivity level controls the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier. Then, the repetitive storm surge events were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency. For the lowfrequency surge event, the variation of salinized metric is the repetition of the unimodal curve in the single surge event. Nevertheless, for the high-frequency surge event, the residual salt mass cannot be flushed out over the simulation period, especially for the low-connectivity aquifer. Meanwhile, the high-frequency surge event broadens the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier. These findings have critical implications for coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial environmental risks of surge-induced vertical saltwater intrusion derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes.",2022,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,610,,,WOS:000821722300001,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127835,,#17508,Song 2022,,
1282,A pinch of salt: response of coastal grassland plants to simulated seawater inundation treatments,"Hanley, ME; Sanders, SKD; Stanton, HM; Billington, RA; Boden, R","Background and Aims The combination of rising sea levels and increased storm frequency and intensity is predicted to increase the severity of oceanic storm surge events and the impact of flooding on coastal ecosystems globally. Understanding how plant communities respond to this threat necessitates experiments involving plant immersion in saline water, but logistical issues and natural variation in seawater composition mean that pure NaCl solutions or marine aquarium salts (MS) are widely used. Nonetheless, their comparative impact on plant ecophysiology, and thus relevance to understanding real-world flooding scenarios, is unknown.Methods In the first of two experiments, we examined how six ecophysiological responses in white clover (Trifolium repens) varied when plants were subjected to five different inundation treatments: deionized water, natural seawater, an MS solution and two NaCl solutions. In a second experiment, we examined how immersion in deionized water, MS solution and natural seawater affected six European perennial herb species, three native to Spanish sand dunes, and three from British coastal grasslands.Results The two NaCl solutions induced exceptional Trifolium mortality, but responses varied little between MS and seawater treatments. In the second experiment, although leaf tissue necrosis and proline concentrations increased, and growth decreased compared with untreated controls, only one response in one species varied between MS and seawater treatments. Chemical speciation modelling revealed major variation in free Na+ and Cl- between NaCl solutions and seawater, but minor differences between MS and seawater.Conclusions We show that NaCl solutions are unsuitable surrogates to investigate plant response to elevated environmental salinity. Although responses to natural seawater and MS were consistent within species, there was notable between-species variation. Consequently, the first steps to elucidating how these species-specific responses influence coastal plant community recovery following storm surge can likely be achieved using commercial marine aquarium salts as substitutes for natural seawater.",2020,,ANNALS OF BOTANY,125,2,265-275,WOS:000540297900006,10.1093/aob/mcz042,,#17520,Hanley 2020,,

Non-parametric trend analysis using the Theil-Sen slope revealed that 84.4 % of statistically significant trends in NDVI were negative, mainly concentrated in scrub mangrove, sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) and spike rush (Eleocharis cellulosa) communities within 5 km of the shoreline. Observed trends were consistent with trends in sawgrass biomass measurements made from 1999 to 2010 in three Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) sites within our study area. A map of significant trends overlaid on a RapidEye high-resolution satellite image showed large patches of negative trends parallel to the shoreline in and around the ""white zone,"" which corresponds to a low-productivity band that has moved inland over the past 70 years.

Recently developed techniques, including a flexible vertical grid system and a 2nd-order, monotone and implicit transport solver are critical in successfully capturing the baroclinic responses. Most importantly, good accuracy is achieved through an accurate representation of the underlying bathymetry, without any smoothing. The model in general exhibits a good skill for all hydrodynamic variables: the averaged root-mean-square errors (RMSE's) in the Bay are 9 cm for sub-tidal frequency elevation, 17 cm/s for 3D velocity time series, 1.5 PSU and 1.9 PSU for surface and bottom salinity respectively, 1.1 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C for surface and bottom temperature respectively. On the shelf, the average RMSE for the surface temperature is 1.4 degrees C.

To detect and analyse saltwater occurrence, a permanent station was installed on La Comte River to measure the electrical conductivity C. The objective of the present study was twofold. First, the temporal link between C, sea water level SWL and river discharge Q was explored during the dry seasons from 2009 to 2012 (total measurement duration of similar to 6 months). A lag of 3 h between C and SWL was evidenced (i.e. the C peaks are delayed by 3 h with high water conditions), as well as the co-occurrence of sea water intrusion with the low Q period. Second, a data-driven approach was set up through a kernel-based support vector machine SVM technique to forecast two events: (1) the forthcoming maximum value of C (for the next 3 h) exceeds 500 mu S/cm; (2) C exceeds 500 mu S/cm during more than 2 h. One potential drawback of such a data-driven approach is to fail to predict outside the range of calibration: this issue was thoroughly explored by means of an intensive bootstrap-based test exercise. It was showed that SVM has very high degree of predictive capability with accuracy and area under receiver operator curve above 90% in average. We additionally analyse the practical implementation of the SVM model with comparison to alternative popular classification techniques (logistic regression, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis): the SVM strength is to provide the nonlinear decision boundary without making a priori restrictive assumptions on its shape (like linear or quadratic methods) and without being too sensitive to noisy observations/outliers. Yet this strength can turn to be a weakness unless a careful examination of the shape is done from a physical perspective.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,76,6,,WOS:000398451000014,10.1007/s12665-017-6553-5,,#17536,Rohmer 2017,,

Those interactions divide into two, which are submarine groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion. This investigation is important because the interactions can give impact to coastal aquifer and marine ecosystem. On land, fresh groundwater is vulnerable to seawater disturbance. Coastal aquifer is under pressure from abstraction caused by population, industry, and agriculture. The pumping can induce seawater intrusion and land subsidence. Then in marine, seawater mixes with freshwater and it decreases salinity. Low salinity will influence marine ecosystem. The ecosystem will be disturbed by groundwater discharge if that water is contaminated. Based on the argue investigation of groundwater-seawater interactions is important and must be accurate because the results are used for coastal water management. To investigate the interactions data, i. e., lithology, pumping tests, hydrochemical data, sea level rise estimates, precipitation data, geophysics, environmental isotopes, and drilling information, should be compiled. The interaction can feed a model to determine how much groundwater extraction happening on coastal areas to prevent seawater intrusion and land subsidence.

1299,Experiment and Numerical Simulation of Seawater Intrusion under the Influences of Tidal Fluctuation and Groundwater Exploitation in Coastal Multilayered Aquifers,"Guo, QN; Huang, JW; Zhou, ZF; Wang, JG","The dynamic behavior of groundwater flow and salt transport is affected by tide and pumping in coastal multilayered aquifers. In this paper, two groups of experiments were conducted considering different constant head inland boundaries. The fluctuation of the groundwater level and the process of seawater intrusion in the multilayered aquifers were observed. A two-dimensional SEAWAT model is developed to simulate the seawater intrusion to coastal aquifers under the influences of tidal fluctuation and groundwater exploitation. The hydrogeological parameters in the model are calibrated by the records of the groundwater level and salinity measurements. The results showed that the simulated groundwater level and salt concentration match the observation well. The groundwater level has the characteristics of periodic fluctuation with tide. The lag time of the groundwater level fluctuation in each monitoring point increases slightly with the increasing distance from the saltwater chamber. For the low tide, the inland freshwater recharge has main effect on groundwater level fluctuation. The rising tide has a negative effect on the drawdown of the groundwater level induced by pumping. For the high tide, the tide plays a major role on groundwater level fluctuation, compared with the inland freshwater recharge. Compared with the condition of high head of inland recharge, larger saltwater intrusion lengths and area have been observed and simulated in the aquifer, which means that faster inland motion of the seawater wedge would occur when the inland recharge is small in the coastal aquifers. It revealed that inland recharge plays a major role in the seawater intrusion for the same pumping rate of groundwater in different seasons. The analysis provides insights into how the tide fluctuation, groundwater pumping, and inland recharge effect on the area and rates of seawater intrusion.",2019,,GEOFLUIDS,2019,,,WOS:000477831600001,10.1155/2019/2316271,,#17546,Guo 2019,,

Seawater intrusion is particularly likely where water tables lie below sea level, but can also arise from groundwater pumping in some coastal aquifers with water tables above sea level. Nevertheless, no nation-wide, observation-based assessment of the scope of potential seawater intrusion exists. Here we compile and analyze similar to 250,000 coastal groundwater-level observations made since the year 2000 in the contiguous United States. We show that the majority of observed groundwater levels lie below sea level along more than 15% of the contiguous coastline. We conclude that landward hydraulic gradients characterize a substantial fraction of the East Coast (>18%) and Gulf Coast (>17%), and also parts of the West Coast where groundwater pumping is high. Sea level rise, coastal land subsidence, and increasing water demands will exacerbate the threat of seawater intrusion.

1307,"Restoration of Isles Dernieres, Louisiana: Some reflections on morphodynamic approaches in the northern Gulf of Mexico to conserve Coastal/Marine systems","Khalil, SM; Lee, DM","The Isles Dernieres barrier island chain, located along the southern Louisiana coast, USA, displays some of the highest rates of erosion for any coastal region in the world, Between 1887 and 1988, the average annual rate of land loss was 28.2 ha yr(-1) whereas the average rate of Gulf shoreline retreat was 11.1 in yr(-1) (McBRIDE et al., 1991). This condition contributed to landward migration (barrier island rollover) and rapid disintegration of the Isles Dernieres sedimentary system. Failure of the barrier decreased the natural protective capacity of the island to maintain the adjacent mainland marshes and wetlands from the effects of storm surge, saltwater intrusion, increased tidal prism, and energetic storm waves (MCBRIDE and BYRNES, 1997). The modem islands are transgressive products of hundreds of years of persistent inundation and shoreline retreat, which has led to the formation of five separate barriers that include: Wine Island, East Island, Trinity Island, Whiskey Island, and Raccoon Island. Modern morphodynamic evolution of these islands is related to high rates of land loss, synergistic effects of relative sea-level rise, land subsidence, tropical and extra-tropical storm activity, inadequate sediment supply, and anthropogenic disturbances (BOYD and PENLAND, 1981; LIST et al.., 1997; PENLAND and RAMSEY, 1990; ROBERTS et al., 1987). In response to accelerated land loss along the fringing mainland marshes, due to continued deterioration of barrier island ecosystems, the State of Louisiana developed near-term strategy in 1993 for large-scale restoration through dedicated dredging of sand. The primary objective of the project was to attempt quasi-stabilization of the landward retreating and disappearing Isles Dernieres by adding sediment to the barrier system and by facilitating vegetative growth on dunes and in marshes to protect the lower Terrebonne Basin estuarine system. The specific goals of the project were to (1) increase the height and width of the islands using dredged sediments; and (2) reduce the loss of dredged sediments through sand fencing and subsequent planting to establish a protective cover on the artificial fill surface. Quantitative evaluation of these goals indicated how well the project objectives were met. Near-vertical aerial photography of the project area and LIDAR surveys facilitated the assessment of project performance. Conclusions are based on the analysis of topographic data collected pre- and post-construction, efficacy of sand fencing, and growth of vegetation on Whiskey, East and Trinity islands. The results of the restoration effort with respect to volumetric changes indicate that the goals were achieved with plausible increase in the longevity of the islands. It was observed that the total habitat area increased, predominantly the bare-land, some times at the expense of other habitats. The survival of the vegetative plantings on the three islands varied due to drought. Initial assessments of the planted vegetation indicate that the planted species dominated in the planted areas but they did not extend significantly to the implanted areas depicting. a lack of spread.",2006,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,65-71,WOS:000202961300011,,,#17557,Khalil 2006,,
1308,"Impacts of physical alterations on salt transport during the dry season in the Modaomen Estuary, Pearl River Delta, China","Liu, CJ; Yu, MH; Jia, LW; Cai, HY; Chen, XQ","Physical alterations (e.g., land reclamation and riverbed down-cutting) caused by human activity may significantly affect the process of salt transport in estuarine systems. Between the 1970s and 2010s, the Modaomen Estuary, an outlet of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), was subject to large-scale land reclamation and riverbed downcutting, which exerted dramatic changes in the transport of salt. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) is used to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different physical alterations in the estuary during the dry season. The modeled results indicate that large-scale land reclamation has decreased landward salt transport, which has weakened the tidal mixing and diffusion in the estuary and has resulted in decreased salinity and a shortened salt intrusion length. In addition, the significant degree of riverbed down-cutting has caused the import of more salt into the estuary, which has enhanced the estuarine circulation to cause further increases in salinity and an extended salt intrusion length. Further, the enhancement of landward salt transport owing to the riverbed down-cutting is much stronger than the weakening effect of land reclamation. All of these local physical alterations have significantly augmented the salt intrusion extent and has intensified the salinity stratification. Consequently, the Modaomen Estuary has changed from partial stratification to high stratification during the past four decades. Although both upstream riverbed down-cutting and sea-level rise facilitate salt intrusion, the impacts from these processes are one order of magnitude smaller than those from the physical alterations made in the estuary. The results obtained in this study have significant implications for the sustainable development of estuarine systems and provide scientific guidelines for general water management, particularly for the prevention of brine tides in the PRD.",2019,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,227,,,WOS:000489190500040,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106345,,#17558,Liu 2019,,

These variations are primarily influenced by atmospheric heat-flux, local hydrodynamics, and geomorphological features. The present study describes the seasonal temperature-salinity profile of a tidal river Halda considering two distinct seasons (monsoon and winter). Surface and bottom temperature and salinity varied from 22.1-28.6 degrees C and 0.4-1.2 psu respectively. Overall temperature variation followed isothermal characteristics in both seasons, while winter was significantly colder than monsoon (p < 0.05). The temperature gradient was almost similar during 2011-12 and 2012-13 but comparatively higher in 2013-14 (0.12 degrees C/m). Salinity concentration found 3-4 folds higher in winter than monsoon without any strong gradient between surface and bottom. As a typical river estuary, salinity decreased upstream. The Halda mouth was remarkably (p < 0.05) salty than upstream sites with 0.04-0.05 psu throughout monsoon and 0.91-1.0 psu amid winters. Three-year trends of salinity have coincided with sea surface elevation with a positive non-significant correlation. The saltwater intrudes about 6 km upstream with sea surface elevation of 0.12 m from 1993 to 2013. Over the years, the rainfall pattern has also been marked as one of the influential factors controlling the temperature-salinity profile.

1311,Untangling complex shallow groundwater dynamics in the floodplain wetlands of a southeastern US coastal river,"Kaplan, D; Munoz-Carpena, R; Ritter, A","Understanding the hydrological functioning of tidally influenced floodplain forests is essential for advancing ecosystem protection and restoration goals in impacted systems. However, finding direct relationships between basic hydrological inputs and floodplain hydrology is hindered by complex interactions between surface water, groundwater, and atmospheric fluxes in a variably saturated matrix with heterogeneous soils, vegetation, and topography. Thus, an explanatory method for identifying common trends and causal factors is required. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA), a time series dimension reduction technique, models temporal variation in observed data as linear combinations of common trends, which represent unidentified common factors, and explanatory variables. In this work, DFA was applied to model water table elevation (WTE) in the floodplain of the Loxahatchee River (Florida, USA), where altered watershed hydrology has led to changing hydroperiod and salinity regimes and undesired vegetative changes in the floodplain forest. The technique proved to be a powerful tool for the study of interactions among 29 long-term, nonstationary hydrological time series (12 WTE series and 17 candidate explanatory variables). Regional groundwater circulation, surface water elevations, and spatially variable net local recharge (cumulative rainfall - cumulative evapotranspiration) were found to be the main factors explaining groundwater profiles. The relative importance of these factors was spatially related to floodplain elevation, distance from the river channel, and distance upstream from the river mouth. The resulting dynamic factor model (DFM) simulated the WTE time series well (overall coefficient of efficiency, C-eff = 0.91) and is useful for assessing management scenarios for ecosystem restoration and predicted sea level rise.",2010,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,46,,,WOS:000280960900003,10.1029/2009WR009038,,#17563,Kaplan 2010,,
1314,Development of FBG salinity sensor coated with lamellar polyimide and experimental study on salinity measurement of gravel aquifer,"Sun, MY; Jiang, HT; Shi, B; Zhou, GY; Inyang, HI; Feng, CX","Under the influence of climate warming, sea level rise and human activities, seawater intrusion has become a significant problem. Seawater intrusion salinates groundwater and impacts on ecological environment and society. It needs to be monitored to scale to environment in order to develop and implement preventive or remedial measures. In-situ large-scale monitoring of groundwater salinity is a key step in the prevention of seawater intrusion. However, current monitoring technologies are either too labor-intensive or excessively expensive when used in large-scale in-situ monitoring. Optical fiber techniques that are presently used in measurements of salinity are mostly limited to laboratory experiments. Herein, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) salinity sensor for in-situ monitoring of groundwater salinity is proposed. The sensor is composed of a FBG coated with polyimide (PI) and an uncoated FBG for salinity sensing and temperature compensation. On the basis of feasibility test and analyses using water diffusion model, a mathematical matrix for calculating salinity and temperature is proposed and applied to salinity measurement in gravel aquifers. The results indicate that the sensitivity coefficients of FBG coated with lamellar polyimide, to water salinity and temperature, are -0.0358 nm/%, 0.0321 nm/degrees C, respectively. The uncoated FBG is only sensitive to temperature, and the sensitivity coefficient is 0.0095 nm/%. The results of gravel aquifer measurements show that the FBG salinity sensor has good repeatability and consistency with measurements obtained with an electronic salinity meter. The absolute and RMS errors of the salinity measurements are -0.16 to 0.21%, 0.1048%, respectively, and the absolute and RMS errors of temperature are -0.31 to 0.33 degrees C, 0.1917 degrees C, respectively. The FBG salinity sensor provides a new means for in-situ monitoring of seawater intrusion.

1315,Groundwater salinity during 500years of anthropogenic-driven coastline changes in the Motril-Salobrena aquifer (South East Spain),"Duque, C; Olser, JT; Sanchez-Obeda, JP; Calvache, ML","The freshwater-saltwater interface position in groundwater at coastal aquifers is determined by the location of the coastline. Anthropogenic-driven changes as modification of the land uses in catchments or the engineering construction in rivers can alter the transport of sediments to the coastal areas affecting to the coastline shape in detrital systems. This is the case of the Motril-Salobrena aquifer where the rapid coastline progradation over the last 500years generated new land previously covered by the sea at a fast rate, 3myear(-1) during hundreds of years. The effect of these changes in the salinity of the aquifer and the flushing time by freshwater has been examined with a paleo-hydrogeological model simulating the transient evolution of the groundwater salinity for the last 500years with SEAWAT. The results of the model indicate a differentiated flushing time depending on the hydraulic properties in the region ranging from 50years in the western sector to up to more than 200years in the central sector for the shallower parts of the aquifer. In the deeper layers, the time can be highly increased but the uncertainties in the hydraulic properties generate different scenarios both in flushing time and water circulation in the aquifer. The sectors in the aquifer where changes took place at a faster rate are also the most sensitive to the effect of global changes, especially those associated to human activity as they occurat shorter time periods.",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,78,15,,WOS:000477589400001,10.1007/s12665-019-8476-9,,#17570,Duque 2019,,
1319,"The Effect of Hurricane Irma Storm Surge on the Freshwater Lens in Big Pine Key, Florida using Electrical Resistivity Tomography","Kiflai, ME; Whitman, D; Ogurcak, DE; Ross, M","Animals and plants on low elevation oceanic islands often rely on a thin lens of fresh groundwater and this lens is vulnerable to seawater contamination from storm surge. Documentation of the impact of the storm surge on the freshwater lens and its subsequent recovery is limited. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys as a category 4 storm with storm surge heights in excess of 2 m. This study used Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to investigate the effect of the storm surge on the freshwater lens of Big Pine Key, FL. The study compared ERT images along three profiles ranging between 220 and 280 m length collected in 2011 with post storm data collected about 3 to 4 months (November 2017/January 2018) and eight (May 2018) months after Irma. The post storm data documented that the storm surge impacted the freshwater lens on all three profiles with low resistivity (i.e., high salinity) zones in the upper 2 m of the groundwater. The increase in salinity was most pronounced in the lower elevations of the profiles. The May 2018 data were collected immediately after 2 weeks of intense precipitation. These data showed 40% recovery of the freshwater lens, most pronounced in the lower elevation of the profiles. This suggests that both the impact of storm surge and the freshwater recovery due to precipitation are most pronounced in low elevation regions where both saline and freshwater can collect at the surface.",2020,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,43,5,1032-1044,WOS:000495741300001,10.1007/s12237-019-00666-3,,#17576,Kiflai 2020,,

Groundwater in coastal regions is often the only freshwater resource available, so an in-depth understanding of the aquifer, and the aquifer's response to climate change, is essential for decision-makers. In this study, we focus on the coastal aquifer of Roussillon (southern France) by developing and investigating a steady-state groundwater flow model (MODFLOW 6) and calibrated with PEST++ on a Python interface (FloPy and PyEmu). Model input and boundary conditions are constrained by various scenarios of climate projections by 2080, with model results predicting the aquifer's response (and associated uncertainty) to these external forcings. Using simple assumptions of intrusion estimates, model results highlight both strong climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the water table. These include aquifer drawdowns reaching several meters locally, and the seawater interface advancing locally several hundred meters inland and rising by several meters. Intrusions of this magnitude risk endangering exploited water wells and their sustainability. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of properly characterizing the geology and its heterogeneity for understanding aquifers at risk because poor predictions may lead to inappropriate decisions, putting critical resources at risk, particularly in coastal environments.",2023,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,82,9,,WOS:000983695200004,10.1007/s12665-023-10877-4,,#17578,Schorpp 2023,,

Abstraction, desalination and recharge consists of abstraction and desalination of brackish water and recharge of desalinated water. The results of different defined scenarios showed that increase of recharge rate has a significant effect on the seawater intrusion mitigation (e.g. more than 80% variation in saline water volume) while the increase of abstraction rate does not have specific impact on seawater recession (e.g. less than 3% variation in toe position). The method efficiency in reducing seawater intrusion is increased when freshwater is recharged by well at outside of saltwater wedge and close to its toe position. Moreover, it is shown that the abstraction, desalination and recharge performance has slightly improved when the recharge and extraction wells are placed deeper into aquifer and close to aquifer bottom (almost 15% for all characteristics of salt wedge). Ultimately, dilution of saline water with recharged freshwater will widen the mixing zone but as salt wedge recedes toward the sea simultaneously, the mixing zone thickness cannot follow the steady reduction trend.

1324,Groundwater pumping in head-controlled coastal systems: The role of lateral boundaries in quantifying the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate,"Lu, CH; Luo, J","The current study explores quantitatively the impact of lateral impermeable boundaries on groundwater pumping in head-controlled coastal systems, based on the potential theory and the image-well superposition method. We compare the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate among three scenarios that assume (SI) an infinite domain width and a finite domain length, (S2) a finite domain width and length, and (SS) an infinite domain width and length. Focusing exclusively on boundary effects, the upstream freshwater discharge is assumed the same for all scenarios, regardless of the variation in domain size. It is found that the impact from both inland and lateral boundaries could play a significant role on the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate (defined as the maximum allowable pumping rate that will not lead to pumping saltwater), depending on sizes of domain length and width. Since the impacts of inland fixed-head boundary and lateral impermeable boundaries are contrary on the maximum interface toe location (defined as the farthest inland point of the interface toe under pumping condition) and maximum pumping rate, they can be offset under certain critical conditions such that the results of the two quantitative indictors (i.e. the maximum interface toe location and maximum pumping rate) in S2 are close to those in SS. In particular, a linear equation is derived to reflect the relationship between the domain width and length under such critical conditions and expressed as L* = 0.87W(*) + 0.62 (W-* > I or L-* > 1.5), in which W-* and L-* are the domain width and length normalized by the distance between the coastline and pumping well. When I: > 0.87W(*) + 0.62, the impact from lateral overcomes that from inland, producing a larger maximum interface toe location and a lower maximum pumping rate than those in SS. When L-* < 0.87W(*) + 0.62, by contrast, the impact from inland exceeds that from lateral and hence, resulting in a smaller maximum interface toe location and a higher maximum pumping rate. It is expected that the results developed in the current study could support the design of numerical models and 3D laboratory experiments as well as the assessment of domain size impact on pumping in head-controlled coastal groundwater systems.

It was demonstrated that the TGD had caused considerable modifications in the downstream freshwater discharge due to its seasonal operation mode of multiple utilisation for flood control, irrigation, and power generation. To understand the impacts of the freshwater regulation of the TGD, an analytical model is adopted to explore how the operation of the TGD may affect the spatial-temporal patterns of tide-river dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. We evaluated the effect of the TGD by comparing the changes in major tide-river dynamics in the post-TGD period (2003-2014) with those in the pre-TGD period (1979-1984). The results indicate that the strongest impacts occurred during the autumn and winter, corresponding to a substantial reduction in freshwater discharge during the wet-to-dry transition period and slightly increased discharge during the dry season. The underlying mechanism leading to changes in the tide-river dynamics lies in the alteration of freshwater discharge, while the impact of geometric change is minimal. Overall, the results suggest that the spatial-temporal pattern of tide-river dynamics is sensitive to the freshwater regulation of the TGD, so that the ecosystem function of the estuary may undergo profound disturbances. The results obtained from this study can be used to set scientific guidelines for water resource management (e.g. navigation, flood control, salt intrusion) in dam-controlled estuarine systems.",2019,,OCEAN SCIENCE,15,3,583-599,WOS:000469224600001,10.5194/os-15-583-2019,,#17582,Cai 2019,,
1327,Geological Heterogeneity of Coastal Unconsolidated Groundwater Systems Worldwide and Its Influence on Offshore Fresh Groundwater Occurrence,"Zamrsky, D; Karssenberg, ME; Cohen, KM; Bierkens, MFP; Essink, GHPO","Numerous coastal areas worldwide already experience fresh water shortages due to overexploitation and salt water intrusion. Future climate change and population growth will further intensify this threat in more areas in coming decades. Therefore, it is necessary to explore any potential fresh water source, such as offshore fresh groundwater, that could alleviate this fresh water shortage and provide valuable time for adaptation measures implementation and changes in water management strategies. Recent evidence suggests that a disproportionally large portion of human population living in coastal areas relies on groundwater resources stored in underlying unconsolidated groundwater systems. These systems are often very heterogeneous, combining numerous high permeability aquifers interlaid with low permeability aquitards with varying total thickness. This heterogeneity is a major control on the fresh groundwater volume and groundwater salinity distribution within such systems. Thus, the quantification of geological heterogeneity is often the limiting factor when estimating fresh groundwater volumes, both inland and offshore, along the global coastline. To overcome this obstacle, we combine conceptual geological models with available state-of-the-art global datasets to derive a set of geological heterogeneity parameter distributions quantifying geological heterogeneity of coastal unconsolidated groundwater systems (CUGSs) as formed over last 1 Ma. These are then used in an algorithm designed to build synthetic heterogenic parameterizations of CUGSs along the global coastline. These, in turn, provide key input for modeling variable-density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport to analyze changes in groundwater salinities and offshore fresh groundwater volume (OFGV). Such an analysis is performed over one full glacial-interglacial cycle (the last 0.13 Ma) to account for oscillating sea-level conditions and shifts in coast-line positions and salinity incursions. Our simulation results show a close match between the modeling scenarios and values presented by literature sources demonstrating the potential of the hereby presented methodology to be applied in similar future studies.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000509916400001,10.3389/feart.2019.00339,,#17584,Zamrsky 2020,,

However, it is unclear how different salt types affect carbon mineralization as a response to salinity levels. In this study, soil samples (0-13 cm) collected in the Liaohe estuarine wetland were amended with NaCl and Na2SO4 salts at five salt levels: 1 mS.cm(-1) (EC1), 3 mS.cm(-1) (EC3), 5 mS.cm(-1) (EC5), 10 mS.cm(-1) (EC10) and 18 mS.cm(-1) (EC18). The amended soils were incubated for 193 d, and the carbon mineralization rates were periodically measured. NaCl has decreased carbon mineralization at all salinity levels, but the effect of Na2SO4 was found only in the high salinity level (EC18). We found a significant ion-specific effect of salt types on carbon mineralization at the lower salinity levels (EC1, EC3 and EC5) but no significant ion-specific effect at the higher salinity levels (EC10 and EC18). The salt effects highly varied with incubation time and the time changes were depended on salt types.

Its consequences negatively impact the gross domestic product of affected countries by limiting economic growth. Arid coastal regions are the most severely affected due to the confluence of periods of greater demand and periods of greater scarcity. In such regions, the most reliable sources of fresh water are coastal aquifers (CAs); however, due to their current overexploitation, CAs are encountering problems such as marine intrusion (MI). In Mexico, the Costa de Hermosillo aquifer (CHA) is one of the most exploited, and at present it is experiencing the negative consequences of MI, which are harming not only quality of life of the inhabitants but also irreparably damaging the regional environment. This article aims to formulate a coastal aquifer management plan through a case study that takes environmental costs into consideration to support decision-making processes and seeks to show how sustainability strategies can be applied to recover, conserve, and sustainably exploit CAs water resources.

The results showed that the salinity distribution was relatively stable and that SWI and SWR processes were almost temporally symmetrical given relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients (0.0269, 0.0209 and 0.0149) between the inland watertable and the mean sea level. However, the salt distribution changed significantly in response to the inland watertable variations when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was relatively small (0.0030). The speed of the SWI and SWR response to the inland watertable variations was temporally asymmetric, e.g., SWR was quicker than SWI by a factor of 9 with respect to the observed saltwater wedge toe locations. As a relatively thick mixing zone (transition between freshwater and saltwater zones) was induced by the fide, simulated saltwater wedge toe locations, as indicated by the 5%, 50% and 95% isohalines, changed inconsistently. Different hysteresis behaviors were found in the relationship between the SW toe locations and total salt mass stored in the aquifer. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the response of both SWI and SWR to the inland watertable variations could be prolonged by a decreased tidal amplitude or decreased tidal period.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,132,,,WOS:000485107700009,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.103393,,#17597,Yu 2019,,

Salt transport and the resulting salinity distributions result from the non-linear interactions between salt and water dynamics. Estuaries are often considered under (quasi)-steady assumption or by focusing on specific timescales. Our understanding of their temporal multiscale response to transient forcing is limited, which hinders the implementation of effective mitigation strategies. We apply wavelet analyses to quantify the variability of salt intrusion from hourly to seasonal timescales and unravel the temporal variability of its response across scales. We focus on an estuary that undergoes significant transient forcing, the Modaomen estuary in the Pearl River Delta, and apply the wavelet analyses to year-long data generated by a coastal ocean numerical model. Our results show that this estuary responds to changes in tidal and riverine forcing throughout the year over interwoven timescales. Our results highlight the temporal variability of the salt intrusion response time both within a given regime and for the transition between regimes. They also suggest that tides control the response time more strongly than river discharge, even though river discharge determines the magnitude of the salt intrusion, and thus modulates the evolution of the salt intrusion response time. We propose a broadly applicable framework to calculate response times with simple data. These results can provide a first-order guidance for design and implementation of estuarine management strategies and mitigation measures that ensure water access and facilitate sustainable development.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,3,,WOS:000776507900015,10.1029/2021JC017523,,#17598,Payo-Payo 2022,,

High salinity concentration in groundwater can be detected several kilometers inland and may result in an increased risk for coastal water supply systems and human health problems. This study investigates the impacts of groundwater pumping practices and regional groundwater flow dynamics on groundwater flow and salinity intrusion in the coastal aquifers of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta using the SEAWAT model-a variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport model. The model was constructed in three dimensions (3D) and accounted for multi-aquifers, variation of groundwater levels in neighboring areas, pumping, and paleo-salinity. Model calibration was carried for 13 years (2000 to 2012), and validation was conducted for 4 years (2013 to 2016). The best-calibrated model was used to develop prediction models for the next 14 years (2017 to 2030). Six future scenarios were introduced based on pumping rates and regional groundwater levels. Modeling results revealed that groundwater pumping activities and variation of regional groundwater flow systems strongly influence groundwater level depletion and saline movement from upper layers to lower layers. High salinity (>2.0 g/L) was expected to expand downward up to 150 m in depth and 2000 m toward surrounding areas in the next 14 years under increasing groundwater pumping capacity. A slight recovery in water level was also observed with decreasing groundwater exploitation.

However, the response of ecosystem carbon exchange to different stages of tidal flooding remains poorly documented. To further explore this issue, we conducted a field experiment to assess the effect of tidal stages (before flooding stage, rising tide stage, tidal flooding stage and after ebbing stage), water levels (a control, a low water level (LWL), a middle water level (MWL) and a high water level (HWL)) and soil salinity on ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the rising tide stage significantly inhibited the uptake of CO2 (LWL: 1.49 +/- 0.23 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 1.10 +/- 0.35 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.54 +/- 0.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Meanwhile, the rising tide stage also promoted CH4 emissions of MWL and HWL treatments (MWL: 0.97 +/- 0.36 nmol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.93 +/- 0.24 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). CH4 emissions of the after ebbing stage was higher than that of the before flooding stage, and this difference was significant of LWL and MWL treatments (LWL: 0.56 +/- 0.12 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 0.79 +/- 0.13 vs 0.40 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Moreover, ecosystem CO2 exchange of the HWL treatment was almost completely suppressed during tidal inundation period. During tidal inundation period, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was significantly positively correlated with water levels, but CH4 emissions was not significantly affected by water levels. In addition, the rate of CO2 uptake decreased linearly with soil salinity during the non-inundation period. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the carbon exchange process coupling with the complete tidal flooding process in future researches.",2020,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,232,,,WOS:000514014000021,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106512,,#17612,Wei 2020,,
1352,Numerical investigation on seawater intrusion and water leakage in different types of stratified coastal aquifers,"Asoodeh, R; Vafaie, F; Mehdizadeh, SS; Movahed, SMA","Prediction of seawater intrusion (SWI) will increase the proper planning for withdrawal of groundwater, and it will help the freshwater management in the future. Since heterogeneous aquifers are more widespread than homogeneous one, this study aims to use the density-dependent SEAWAT code to investigate the influence of different combinations of hydraulic conductivity (K) on SWI. The effects of numbers and arrangement of layers with different K are examined on (a) toe position, (b) freshwater-seawater mixing zone thickness (W-t) and (c) leakage from adjacent layers in a steady-state condition. For this purpose, numerous scenarios with different Kwere simulated and analyzed.The results of horizontally layered aquifers showed that the streamlines are broken on boundary of layers. It was observed that when K is decreased, especially at the middle layer, the refraction angle is increased and consequently W-t is increased. The W-t in vertically layered cases was less than horizontally layered aquifers because of less streamline breakage. Also, random arrangement of K directs the saline flow to higher permeability zones. Thus, the SWI extent in this type of aquifer was more tangible than other types. Because of the difference in hydraulic head at layer borders, the seepage rate significantly increases nearby toe position and the dominant direction is upward. However, in the steady-state condition, the type of flow did not differ significantly for boundary cells of layers at the vicinity of toe position.",2019,,SN APPLIED SCIENCES,1,8,,WOS:000476622600001,10.1007/s42452-019-0842-4,,#17614,Asoodeh 2019,,
1353,Investigating how river flow regimes impact on river delta salinization through idealized modeling,"Matsoukis, C; Amoudry, LO; Bricheno, L; Leonardi, N","IntroductionExcessive salinity can harm ecosystems and compromise the various anthropogenic activities that take place in river deltas. The issue of salinization is expected to exacerbate due to natural and/or anthropogenic climate change. Water regulations are required to secure a sufficient water supply in conditions of limited water volume availability. Research is ongoing in seek of the optimum flow distribution establishing longer lasting and fresher conditions in deltas. MethodsIn this study a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model built for an idealized delta configuration was utilized to investigate how different river discharge annual distributions affect saltwater in deltas. Five simulations were carried out by implementing annual distributions of equal water volume but different shape. ResultsThe results showed that peak flow magnitude, time of occurrence and the length of a hydrograph's tails can be important parameters affecting stratification, freshwater residence, and renewal times. Hydrographs of small flow range and light tails were the most successful in keeping the delta and its trunk channel fresher for longer periods. Salinity distributions showed a slower response to decreasing rather than increasing river discharges. An increase in the flow rate can result in salinity standards demanded for certain activities (e.g., farming, irrigation etc.) in much shorter times. On the other hand, hydrographs with heavy tails can push the salt intrusion limit further away and be more efficient in mixing the water column. However, they present low freshwater residence and high-water renewal times. DiscussionThese results provide strong indications that it is possible to improve the freshwater conditions in deltas without seeking for additional water resources but by modifying the water distribution. The main outcomes of this work may be able to support and assist coastal scientists and stakeholders dealing with the management of freshwater resources in river deltas across the world.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000933837200001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1075683,,#17616,Matsoukis 2023,,
1354,Groundwater Throughflow and Seawater Intrusion in High Quality Coastal Aquifers,"Costall, AR; Harris, BD; Teo, B; Schaa, R; Wagner, FM; Pigois, JP","High quality coastal aquifer systems provide vast quantities of potable groundwater for millions of people worldwide. Managing this setting has economic and environmental consequences. Specific knowledge of the dynamic relationship between fresh terrestrial groundwater discharging to the ocean and seawater intrusion is necessary. We present multi- disciplinary research that assesses the relationships between groundwater throughflow and seawater intrusion. This combines numerical simulation, geophysics, and analysis of more than 30 years of data from a seawater intrusion monitoring site. The monitoring wells are set in a shallow karstic aquifer system located along the southwest coast of Western Australia, where hundreds of gigalitres of fresh groundwater flow into the ocean annually. There is clear evidence for seawater intrusion along this coastal margin. We demonstrate how hydraulic anisotropy will impact on the landward extent of seawater for a given groundwater throughflow. Our examples show how the distance between the ocean and the seawater interface toe can shrink by over 100% after increasing the rotation angle of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy when compared to a homogeneous aquifer. We observe extreme variability in the properties of the shallow aquifer from ground penetrating radar, hand samples, and hydraulic parameters estimated from field measurements. This motived us to complete numerical experiments with sets of spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields, representative of karstic aquifers. The hydraulic conductivity proximal to the zone of submarine groundwater discharge is shown to be significant in determining the overall geometry and landward extent of the seawater interface. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) data was acquired and assessed for its ability to recover the seawater interface. Imaging outcomes from field ERI data are compared with simulated ERI outcomes derived from transport modelling with a range of hydraulic conductivity distributions. This process allows for interpretation of the approximate geometry of the seawater interface, however recovery of an accurate resistivity distribution across the wedge and mixing zone remains challenging. We reveal extremes in groundwater velocity, particularly where fresh terrestrial groundwater discharges to the ocean, and across the seawater recirculation cell. An overarching conclusion is that conventional seawater intrusion monitoring wells may not be suitable to constrain numerical simulation of the seawater intrusion. Based on these lessons, we present future options for groundwater monitoring that are specifically designed to quantify the distribution of; (i) high vertical and horizontal pressure gradients, (ii) sharp variations in subsurface flow velocity, (iii) extremes in hydraulic properties, and (iv) rapid changes in groundwater chemistry. These extremes in parameter distribution are common in karstic aquifer systems at the transition from land to ocean. Our research provides new insights into the behaviour of groundwater in dynamic, densely populated, and ecologically sensitive coastal environments found worldwide.",2020,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10,1,,WOS:000543960400008,10.1038/s41598-020-66516-6,,#17619,Costall 2020,,
1357,Modelling saline intrusion using dynamic mesh optimization with parallel processing,"Hamzehloo, A; Bahlali, ML; Salinas, P; Jacquemyn, C; Pain, CC; Butler, AP; Jackson, MD","Saline intrusion (SI) in coastal aquifers is a global problem with the potential to contaminate groundwater used by over a billion people. Numerical modelling of SI in coastal aquifers is a key tool for risk assessment, aquifer management and resource regulation, but is extremely challenging because the mixing zone across the saline front is often very narrow, extending over metres or 10's metres, yet the saline front itself may extend laterally over a large (i.e. many km) three-dimensional (3D) domain. Moreover, the aquifer may be highly heterogeneous, further complicating the movement and geometry of the front. We test here the use of dynamic mesh optimization (DMO) in a parallel computational framework to simulate SI with higher accuracy and lower computational cost compared to fixed-mesh approaches. The framework uses a double control-volume-finite element (DCVFE) method and is implemented in the open-source Imperial College Finite Element Reservoir SimulaTor (IC-FERST), but could be implemented in other FE-based simulators. We confirm accuracy and convergence using test cases based on the classic 'Henry' SI problem, demonstrating that solutions obtained using DMO require significantly fewer elements and therefore have much lower computational cost compared to equivalent fixed mesh solutions. We apply the framework to a realistic 3D case study simulating saline intrusion in a heterogeneous chalk aquifer, demonstrating simulation speed-up in excess of 120x. We suggest that parallelized DMO offers significant advantages over existing methods to simulate SI.",2022,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,164,,,WOS:000805131600006,10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104189,,#17622,Hamzehloo 2022,,
1358,The Henry problem: New semianalytical solution for velocity-dependent dispersion,"Fahs, M; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Younes, A; Simmons, CT; Ackerer, P","A new semianalytical solution is developed for the velocity-dependent dispersion Henry problem using the Fourier-Galerkin method (FG). The integral arising from the velocity-dependent dispersion term is evaluated numerically using an accurate technique based on an adaptive scheme. Numerical integration and nonlinear dependence of the dispersion on the velocity render the semianalytical solution impractical. To alleviate this issue and to obtain the solution at affordable computational cost, a robust implementation for solving the nonlinear system arising from the FG method is developed. It allows for reducing the number of attempts of the iterative procedure and the computational cost by iteration. The accuracy of the semianalytical solution is assessed in terms of the truncation orders of the Fourier series. An appropriate algorithm based on the sensitivity of the solution to the number of Fourier modes is used to obtain the required truncation levels. The resulting Fourier series are used to analytically evaluate the position of the principal isochlors and metrics characterizing the saltwater wedge. They are also used to calculate longitudinal and transverse dispersive fluxes and to provide physical insight into the dispersion mechanisms within the mixing zone. The developed semianalytical solutions are compared against numerical solutions obtained using an in house code based on variant techniques for both space and time discretization. The comparison provides better confidence on the accuracy of both numerical and semianalytical results. It shows that the new solutions are highly sensitive to the approximation techniques used in the numerical code which highlights their benefits for code benchmarking.",2016,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,52,9,7382-7407,WOS:000386977900038,10.1002/2016WR019288,,#17623,Fahs 2016,,

This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.",2020,,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,65,5,1116-1135,WOS:000520763200001,10.1002/lno.11438,,#17625,Kreuzburg 2020,,
1362,Occurrence of seawater intrusion overshoot,"Morgan, LK; Bakker, M; Werner, AD","A number of numerical modeling studies of transient sea level rise (SLR) and seawater intrusion (SI) in flux-controlled aquifer systems have reported an overshoot phenomenon, whereby the freshwater-saltwater interface temporarily extends further inland than the eventual steady state position. Recently, physical sand-tank modeling has shown overshoot to be a physical process. In this paper, we have carried out numerical modeling of SLR-SI to demonstrate that overshoot can occur at the field scale within unconfined aquifers. This result is contrary to previous conclusions drawn from a restricted number of cases. In addition, we show that SI overshoot is plausible under scenarios of gradual sea level rise that are consistent with conditions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Overshoot was found to be largest in flux-controlled unconfined aquifers characterized by low freshwater flux, high specific yield, and large inland extent. These conditions result in longer timeframes for the aquifer to reach new steady state conditions following SLR, and the extended period prior to reequilibration of the groundwater flow field produces more extensive overshoot.",2015,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,51,4,1989-1999,WOS:000354733500007,10.1002/2014WR016329,,#17640,Morgan 2015,,
1363,"Arsenic-rich shallow groundwater in sandy aquifer systems buffered by rising carbonate waters: A geochemical case study from Mannar Island, Sri Lanka","Bandara, UGC; Diyabalanage, S; Hanke, C; van Geldern, R; Barth, JAC; Chandrajith, R","Major ion, trace elements, and stable isotope analyses were performed on groundwater samples collected from Mannar Island in the northern Indian Ocean. Arsenic concentrations up to 34 mu g/L have been observed in groundwater samples from the island. In addition, 23% of extensively used shallow drinking water wells showed higher arsenic contents than the recommended value by the World Health Organization (10 mu g/L). Groundwater in the island showed pH values between 6.9 and 8.9 and was dominated by Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl- and SO42-. The delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O) composition of most groundwater plotted very close to the local meteoric waterline, however, some wells showed enriched isotope compositions that are most likely due to evaporation. Sea water intrusion in this island was likely of minor importance as indicated by the major ion composition. An approximated mass balance calculation using chloride concentrations indicated that out of the 35 investigated wells only 6 near-shore wells were influenced by sea water intrusion up to about 15%. Even though this is a sandy aquifer, groundwaters were characterized with higher contents of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (2.11-0.9 mmol/L). The corresponding delta C-13(DIC) values varied from -19.4 parts per thousand to -6.5 parts per thousand. Except for a few samples with values approaching -20 parts per thousand, these isotope values are more typical for carbonate dissolution and equilibration of CO2 in the aquifer. This study shows that the underlying carbonate system may buffer the aqueous geochemistry of the groundwater on the island. The high arsenic content in groundwater may have beenmobilized through reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn oxides and oxy-hydroxides that are coated on sandy aquifer materials. The lower content of DOC (0.2-1.5 mmol/L) provides evidence for the restricted formation of pyrite in the aquifer. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1365,Bridging groundwater models and decision support with a Bayesian network,"Fienen, MN; Masterson, JP; Plant, NG; Gutierrez, BT; Thieler, ER","Resource managers need to make decisions to plan for future environmental conditions, particularly sea level rise, in the face of substantial uncertainty. Many interacting processes factor in to the decisions they face. Advances in process models and the quantification of uncertainty have made models a valuable tool for this purpose. Long-simulation runtimes and, often, numerical instability make linking process models impractical in many cases. A method for emulating the important connections between model input and forecasts, while propagating uncertainty, has the potential to provide a bridge between complicated numerical process models and the efficiency and stability needed for decision making. We explore this using a Bayesian network (BN) to emulate a groundwater flow model. We expand on previous approaches to validating a BN by calculating forecasting skill using cross validation of a groundwater model of Assateague Island in Virginia and Maryland, USA. This BN emulation was shown to capture the important groundwater-flow characteristics and uncertainty of the groundwater system because of its connection to island morphology and sea level. Forecast power metrics associated with the validation of multiple alternative BN designs guided the selection of an optimal level of BN complexity. Assateague island is an ideal test case for exploring a forecasting tool based on current conditions because the unique hydrogeomorphological variability of the island includes a range of settings indicative of past, current, and future conditions. The resulting BN is a valuable tool for exploring the response of groundwater conditions to sea level rise in decision support.",2013,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,49,10,6459-6473,WOS:000327432500023,10.1002/wrcr.20496,,#17648,Fienen 2013,,

The importance of considering aquifer characteristics while modeling the groundwater system for flow and solute transport is emphasized.

The significant aspects to be considered while direct modeling of coastal aquifers are discussed and the recent focus of research in this area of interest are stated. In direct modeling, information on aquifer parameters are often unknown, therefore, an inverse approach is explained briefly. The previous studies relating to determistic inverse modeling for coupled groundwater flow and solute transport problems reported in literature are summarized.

A 2D numerical model created with the software MOHID was used to simulate the Guadiana Estuary in different scenarios of sea level rise combined with different freshwater flow rates. An increase in salinity was found in response to an increase in mean sea level in low and intermediate freshwater flow rates. An increase in flooding areas around the estuary were also positively correlated with an increase in mean sea level.,2019,,"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - ICCS 2019, PT IV",11539,,287-300,WOS:000589297100023,10.1007/978-3-030-22747-0_23,,#17665,Mills 2019,,

While high concentrations of suspended sediments can cause a reduction of oyster density, some level of suspended sediment is required to supply oysters with necessary nutrients. In this study, characteristics of TSS variations in response to sea level rise (SLR) at two oyster reefs in Apalachicola Bay are investigated by coupled estuarine hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling. A storm event in 1993 and a year-long period in 2010 under recent sea level conditions are selected as the baseline conditions. Scenarios of river flow and sediment loads under SLR and climate change are obtained by downscaled global climate modeling. Compared to the baseline conditions, simulations of TSS indicate that predicted SLR yields a substantial decrease in TSS near the two oyster reefs. However, TSS levels differed at the two study locations. TSS changes by SLR revealed minimal impact on oyster habitat at the Dry Bar site (to the west of the mouth of the Apalachicola River) but are projected to have a significant impact at the Cat Point site (to the east of the Apalachicola River). At Cat Point, because SLR causes the increase of salt water intrusion from the Gulf through a large tidal inlet (East Pass), maximum sediment concentration is near zero for 0.2-m SLR and equal to zero for 0.5- and 1.2-m SLR. Therefore, SLR may result in a substantial loss of nutrients from suspended sediment in the oyster reef at Cat Point.",2016,,EARTHS FUTURE,4,10,428-439,WOS:000387762100001,10.1002/2016EF000384,,#17690,Huang 2016,,

The Vermilion is a tidal freshwater river affected by baseflow regulation, rapid urbanization, and hydromodification. This river also serves as major freshwater resource for the region. An efficient one-dimensional model calibrated previously for stage and water temperature is used to analyse the salinity impacts due to a large-scale flood control dredging. The analysis is based on 200 alternative scenarios based on combinations of uncertain key forcing variables for a critical 13-day intrusion period. The analysis reveals a nonlinear effect on mean salinities and position of the brackish water limit as a function of uncertain forcing variables. Dredging also increases the variability of salinity encroachment effects due to uncertainty in future forcing conditions (e.g. relative sea level rise, baseflow diversion volumes, and salinities at the river mouth).

It was also found that the change of discharge in the Han River, caused by the water supplying to the Ara River, can increase the salt concentration in the vicinity of the Singok Submerged Weir by 0.5 psu. As agricultural productivity can be affected by even this small amount of salt concentration change, much closer attention should be paid to the relation between water-intake condition and its effect on the Han River.",2017,,KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,21,5,1945-1955,WOS:000404144000046,10.1007/s12205-016-0020-9,,#17754,Ahn 2017,,

A coupled 3D hydrodynamic and fecal coliform transport model was developed and applied to the Danshuei River estuarine system for predicting the influences of climate change on microbiological water quality. The hydrodynamic and fecal coliform model was validated using observational salinity and fecal coliform distributions. According to the analyses of the statistical error, predictions of the salinity and the fecal coliform concentration from the model simulation quantitatively agreed with the observed data. The validated model was then applied to predict the fecal coliform contamination as a result of climate change, including the change of freshwater discharge and the sea level rise. We found that the reduction of freshwater discharge under climate change scenarios resulted in an increase in the fecal coliform concentration. The sea level rise would decrease fecal coliform distributions because both the water level and the water volume increased. A reduction in freshwater discharge has a negative impact on the fecal coliform concentration, whereas a rising sea level has a positive influence on the fecal coliform contamination.

However, coastal freshwaters currently face numerous threats, not least (i) changing tidal dynamics due to sea level rise and (ii) changes in river regimes due to dam construction upstream. This research explores the evolution of freshwater regimes in these coastal estuaries. Using process diagrams, freshwater distributions are mapped and analyzed. Application of statistical methods provides insight into freshwater flow cycles and variations in water regimes upstream at various measurement points within the estuaries. A previously calibrated and validated hydraulic model is used to simulate drought-year scenarios and spatial changes in freshwaters over time. Findings indicate decreasing river discharges in the flood season, but increasing discharges in the dry season, due to the impacts of hydropower dams. In addition, the driest months are shifting earlier. From this data, we derive rules of thumb regarding freshwater distributions in the coastal estuaries of the VMD. These relate to (i) the boundary beyond which freshwater is always found; (ii) the boundary where freshwater appears daily; (iii) the start of the freshwater season; (iii) the boundary where freshwater appears until February and until April; (iv) the end of the flood season; and (v) the number of days without freshwater per year.

Stressed vegetation that is incapable of regeneration will be difficult to maintain if adults are experiencing mortality, and/or if their early life-history stages depend on disturbance. A variety of active management strategies employing disturbance are suggested, including resisting, accommodating, or directing vegetation change by manipulating management intensity and frequency. Particularly if land-use change is the main cause of vegetation stress, amelioration of these problems using management may help vegetation resist change (e.g. strategic timing of water release if a water control structure is available). Managers could direct succession by using management to push vegetation toward a new state. Despite the historical effects of management, some vegetation change will not be controllable as climates shift, and managers may have to accept some of these changes. Nevertheless, proactive measures may help managers achieve important conservation goals in the future.",2017,,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,25,3,326-329,WOS:000402012700001,10.1111/rec.12507,,#17765,Middleton 2017,,

This transformation is associated with high risks in terms of production and management. Thus, the study was conducted to propose solutions for improving economic efficiency of intensive shrimp farmers. The study conducted face-to-face interviews with 125 farmers in both Soc Trang and Kien Giang provinces. By using one-step stochastic frontier analysis, the study showed that the average economic efficiency of shrimp farming in Kien Giang is 89.98%, which is not significant different to that in Soc Trang (86.95%). These efficiency indexes indicate that at the current output level, the shrimp farmers in Soc Trang and Kien Giang can reduce by 10.02% and 13.05%, respectively, of the total observed variable cost.

1388,Dynamics of salt intrusion in the Mekong Delta: results of field observations and integrated coastal-inland modelling,"Eslami, S; Hoekstra, P; Kernkamp, HWJ; Trung, NN; Duc, DD; Nghia, HN; Quang, TT; van Dam, A; Darby, SE; Parsons, DR; Vasilopoulos, G; Braat, L; van der Vegt, M","On the list of challenges facing the world largest deltas, increased saline water intrusion (SWI) in the surface water system and its role in jeopardizing freshwater supply are often ranked very high. Yet, detailed process-based studies of SWI at the whole delta scale are limited, and the trends are regularly associated with global sea level rise. Here, using field measurements and a sophisticated 3D model that integrates the riverine, rural, estuarine, and coastal dynamics within one numerical domain, we study SWI at the scale of the Mekong Delta in extensive detail. While many studies downscale the SWI problem to a topic within an estuary, we show that the physical processes on the continental shelf, such as monsoon-driven ocean surge, directly influence salinity dynamics within the delta. Typical values of 20-40 cm surge over the continental shelf contribute to up to 10 km of further SWI. The delta's estuarine system is also more sensitive than many other systems to variations of river discharge. Furthermore, spring-neap variability plays a key role in SWI in the delta. The estuarine variability from a stratified to a mixed system between neap and spring tides develops 3D processes such as estuarine circulation and tidal straining that become the main upstream salt transport mechanisms. The 3D nature of salinity dynamics, and the role of upstream and downstream processes, suggests that compromising on dimension or extent of the numerical domain can limit the accuracy of predictions of SWI in the delta. The study also showcases the fact that riverbed incision in response to anthropogenic sediment starvation in the last 2 decades has increased stratification and activated or magnified 3D salt transport subprocesses that amplify upstream salt transport. With all the external forces on the delta, namely climate change and an altered hydrological regime by the upstream dams, due to deeper estuarine channels (driven by sand mining and upstream impoundments) compared to its near past, the delta itself has become far more vulnerable to even mild natural events. This exemplifies the fundamental importance of preserving the sediment budget and riverbed levels in protecting the world's deltas against SWI.",2021,,EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS,9,4,953-976,WOS:000685223500001,10.5194/esurf-9-953-2021,,#17775,Eslami 2021,,
1394,Estuarine tidal range dynamics under rising sea levels,"Khojasteh, D; Chen, SY; Felder, S; Heimhuber, V; Glamore, W","How an estuary responds to sea level rise (SLR) is complex and depends on energy drivers (e.g., tides and river inflows), estuarine geometry (e.g., length and depth), intrinsic fluid properties (e.g., density), and bed/bank roughness. While changes to the tidal range under SLR can impact estuarine sediment transport, water quality, and vegetation communities, studies on the altered tidal range under SLR are often based on case studies with outcomes applicable to a specific site. As such, this study produced a large ensemble of estuarine hydrodynamic models (>1800) to provide a systematic understanding of how tidal range dynamics within different estuary types may change under various SLR and river inflow scenarios. The results indicated that SLR often amplifies the tidal range of different estuary types, except for short estuaries with a low tidal range at the mouth where SLR attenuates the tides. SLR alters the location of the points with minimum tidal range and overall tidal range patterns in an estuary. Variations in tidal range were more evident in converging estuaries, shallower systems, or in estuaries with strong river inflows. These findings provide an indication of how different estuary types may respond to estuaries and may assist estuarine managers and decision makers.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,9,,WOS:000707078200044,10.1371/journal.pone.0257538,,#17788,Khojasteh 2021,,
1395,SEA-LEVEL RISE AND THE REDUCTION IN PINE FORESTS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS,"ROSS, MS; OBRIEN, JJ; STERNBERG, LDL","Forests dominated by Pinus elliottii var densa have undergone a reduction in area in the Florida Keys (USA). A previous investigation interpreted the presence of halophytic species in a former pine forest in Key Large as evidence of sea-level rise. We therefore examined aerial photos and field evidence to learn how the 15-cm rise in local sea level over the last 70 yr had affected the distribution of pines on a second island, where intact pine forests still remained in 1991. The distribution of in situ dead pine stems showed that the area occupied by pines on Sugarloaf Key was 88 ha at some time prior to the earliest available aerial photographs, in 1935. The area of pine forest was reduced to 46 ha by 1935, and continued to decrease through 1991, when it covered 30 ha. The pattern of pine mortality was related to topographic position, with the areas where pines died earliest occupying the lowest elevations. Our analysis of current vegetation patterns showed that the areas of earliest pine mortality are now populated by a higher proportion of halophytic plant assemblages than areas of more recent pine mortality. We also compared the physiological responses of pines in two portions of the island: one where pine forest reduction had been most pronounced, and a second where the extent of the forest had changed little over the past 50 yr. Both groundwater and soil water salinity were higher in the area of rapid pine forest reduction, and the pines sampled there exhibited higher physiological stress, as indicated by pre-dawn water potential and stemwood carbon isotope ratios. These results suggest that the salinization of ground- and soil water that occurs as sea level rises is a major factor in the reduction of pine forests of Sugarloaf Key. If sea level continues to increase, the Florida Keys will experience a decline in both landscape and species diversity, as species-rich upland communities are replaced by simpler mangrove communities. This pattern may also occur in other low-lying island ecosystems with limited freshwater resources.",1994,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,4,1,144-156,WOS:A1994MU60500016,10.2307/1942124,,#17819,ROSS 1994,,

1401,A review of recent advances and future challenges in freshwater salinization,"Iglesias, MCA","In spite of being a worldwide phenomenon that can have important ecological, economic and social consequences, freshwater salinization (i.e. the increase in ion concentrations in freshwaters) has been poorly studied when compared with other environmental issues. However, it is receiving increasing attention, with significant scientific advances being made during the last two decades. Here I review the current knowledge on the topic and propose future research directions within the context of human welfare and global change. Freshwater salinization is caused by a wide range of human activities, with agriculture and resource extraction being the most widely documented. Different studies suggest that it could be affecting around 1/3 of freshwater bodies, and this number will very likely increase in the future due to climate and land use changes. The increase in the salinity of freshwaters is known to cause adverse effects on the fitness and survival of many aquatic organisms, however the osmoregulatory mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood. Moreover, it has been proved that different ions can have different toxicities to aquatic organisms, but most of the research has focused exclusively on Na+ and Cl-. Thus, more investigations on the potential effects of increasing concentrations of other specific ions (e.g. K+, SO42-) are needed. The impact of salinization on freshwater biodiversity can alter ecosystem functioning, although only a few functions have been studied (e.g. leaf litter decomposition). Also, freshwater salinization can affect the delivery of ecosystem services and have direct economic (e.g. infrastructure corrosion) and social (e.g. human health) impacts that have rarely been assessed. The management of this urgent environmental issue needs to be improved through mitigation (e.g. backfilling of mine tailings), remediation (e.g. enhanced wastewater treatment), prevention (e.g. using alternative deicers for roads) and monitoring (e.g. estimating salt loads to freshwater ecosystems) actions.",2020,,LIMNETICA,39,1,185-211,WOS:000509685900014,10.23818/limn.39.13,,#17880,Iglesias 2020,,

The second phase of development took place after the Roman occupation and continues to the present day, but again we do not know exactly when it began.

Increasing salinity in freshwater systems, as an environmental stressor, may negatively affect normal life activities in fish. It has been documented that salinity limits the invasive success of alien species by mediating physiological and life-history performances, however, there are few studies on how salinity affects its invasive process via altered behaviors. Using wild-caught invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as animal model, in this study, we asked whether gradual increasing salinity affects behaviors (personality and mate choice decision here), life-history traits, as well as the correlation between them by exposing G. affinis to three levels salinity (freshwater, 10 and 20 parts per thousand). Results showed that, with increased salinity, male tended to be shyer, less active, less sociable, and reduced desire to mate, and female tended to be shyer, less active and lost pref-erences for the larger male. Furthermore, across salinity treatments, male exhibited reduced body fat content and rising reproduction allocation, however, pregnant female revealed diametrically opposed trends. In addition, the correlation between life-history traits and behaviors was only identified in pregnant female. It seems that either salinity or life-history traits directly affects mosquitofish behaviors. In summary, our results partially emphasize the harmful consequences of salinity on both life-history traits and behavioral performances. These findings provide a novel perspective on how salinity potentially affect fish fitness via altering personalities, mate choice decisions, as well as body condition, and hence supports the idea that salinity could affect the spread of invasive mosquitofish.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,308,,,WOS:000822715000002,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119658,,#17892,Zhou 2022,,

Taking Zhuyu Lake as the research object, the Spatio-temporal variations of water salinity under different seasons were investigated using the field survey and modeling. The influencing factors of the water salinity of the reservoir were analyzed to discover the variation mechanism. The results showed that the disturbance of overlying water is the most significant factor affecting the salt release of sediment, and salt release was increased by 63.3% with the disturbance. The depth of the overlying water and the salt content of bottom sediment also significantly affected the release of salt, with maximum enhancement by 23.1% and 45.6%, respectively. The microbial content in the bottom mud played an essential role in maintaining the salt, and inhibiting the microbial activity could enhance the release of salt by 35.7%. Therefore, disturbing the sediment by using disturbance ships or aeration devices, and the establishment of a long-term periodic plant harvesting belt could be used in the coastal fresh reservoirs desalination and slowing down the salinization of fresh reservoirs.

Soil, the basis of human sustenance, is both directly and indirectly affected by climate change. Soil erosion, vegetation degradation and soil salinisation are becoming prevalent, causing a threat to future food security. Saline soils are found mainly in North and Central Asia, Africa and South America. Various factors such as excess irrigation and poor drainage, groundwater salinity, sea level rise and intrusion, irregular rainfall contribute to the process of soil salinisation. The key findings of this paper are as follows: Salt-affected soils cover an area of around 1060.1 Mha in the world and their area is gradually increasing due to the influence of climate change; soil salinity tends to increase with increase in sea level intrusion and temperature, decrease in precipitation and improper irrigation management. Though, soil salinisation has been extensively researched and recorded in coastal areas, inland areas are yet to be assessed and monitored and there is enormous scope for research on the correlation between climate change and soil salinity drivers at global and regional scale.

The present study was carried out to determine the hydrogeochemical processes and influence of seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers using geophysical, geochemical, and stable isotope techniques. The true resistivity value ranges from 0.5 to 8008.5 Omega-m which has been measured using vertical electrical sounding (VES) based on the Schlumberger method. About 33 groundwater samples were collected during post-monsoon (POM) (January 2012) and pre-monsoon (PRM) (June 2012) seasons from open and bore wells and were analyzed for major ions and stable isotopes. EC, Na+, and Cl- were high in groundwater of wells near salt pan, the Buckingham Canal, and backwater regions. Around 45% of the groundwater of this study area is of Na+-Cl- type due to salinisation. Reverse ion exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the geochemistry of groundwater. Saturation indexes (SI) of halite (SIhalite) and gypsum (SIgypsum) versus sulfate show an increasing trend line from > 0 to < 0, which implies higher dissolution of minerals and hints increasing salinization during both seasons. The value of Na+/Cl- ranges between 0.7 and 2.4 (POM) and from 0.6 to 2.8 (PRM). The molar ratio suggested that around 25% of the groundwater samples are with values similar to those of seawater. Further, the groundwater is also affected by saline backwater, salt pan activities, and Buckingham Canal. Some locations are also are affected by anthropogenic, agricultural activities and geochemical processes. Heavy stable isotopes were found to be dominant in the coastal region due to seawater intrusion. Stable isotopes of delta O-18 range from -5.6 to -2.9 parts per thousand during both periods.

Most research on salinization vulnerability and pumping rate optimization considers constant seaside boundary. However, tidal fluctuations may propagate through aquifers and affect pumping-induced seawater intrusion. We numerically tested the combined effects of tidal fluctuations and groundwater pumping on the variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in aquifers with pumping wells close to the coast. The simulations showed that tidal fluctuations relieved seawater intrusion due to groundwater extraction. Stronger tidal fluctuation created larger upper saline plume which inhibited the seawater intrusion in the lower aquifer. Compared with those without tides, the tidal fluctuations with a tidal amplitude of 1 m could increase maximum pumping rate by 35.2 % and 28.7 % in flux-and head-controlled systems, respectively. These results suggest that combined impacts of tides and pumping should be considered in assessing seawater intrusion and designing more so-phisticated pumping optimization.",2022,,MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,184,,,WOS:000877318200006,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114231,,#18043,Yu 2022,,
1418,Effects of Geologic Setting on Contaminant Transport in Deltaic Aquifers,"Xu, ZY; Hariharan, J; Passalacqua, P; Steel, E; Chadwick, A; Paola, C; Paldor, A; Michael, HA","Coastal deltaic aquifers are vulnerable to degradation from seawater intrusion, geogenic and anthropogenic contamination, and groundwater abstraction. The distribution and transport of contaminants are highly dependent on the subsurface sedimentary architecture, such as the presence of channelized features that preferentially conduct flow. Surface deposition changes in response to sea-level rise (SLR) and sediment supply, but it remains unclear how these surface changes affect the distribution and transport of groundwater solutes in aquifers. Here, we explore the influence of SLR and sediment supply on aquifer heterogeneity and resulting effects on contaminant transport. We use realizations of subsurface heterogeneity generated by a process-based numerical model, DeltaRCM, which simulates the evolution of a deltaic aquifer with different input sand fractions and rates of SLR. We simulate groundwater flow and solute transport through these deposits in three contamination scenarios: (a) vertical transport from widespread contamination at the land surface, (b) vertical transport from river water infiltration, and (c) lateral seawater intrusion. The simulations show that the vulnerability of deltaic aquifers to seawater intrusion correlates to sand fraction, while vertical transport of contaminants, such as widespread shallow contamination and river water infiltration, is influenced by channel stacking patterns. This analysis provides new insights into the connection between the depositional system properties and vulnerability to different modes of groundwater contamination. It also illustrates how vulnerability may vary locally within a delta due to depositional differences. Results suggest that groundwater management strategies may be improved by considering surface features, location within the delta, and the external forcings during aquifer deposition.",2022,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,58,9,,WOS:000855369700001,10.1029/2022WR031943,,#18047,Xu 2022,,
1419,EFFECTS OF WATER TRANSFERS PROJECTED IN THE SPANISH NATIONAL HYDROLOGICAL PLAN ON THE ECOLOGY OF THE LOWER RIVER EBRO (NE SPAIN) AND ITS DELTA,"PRAT, N; IBANEZ, C","This paper refers to the effects of projected water transfers, envisaged in the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, on the ecology of the lower River Ebro and its delta. Present management strategies, have resulted in highly eutrophic river water and a salt wedge which runs for more than 30 km upstream from the river mouth and its presence has been recorded during most of the year. Some parts of the delta coast are in regression as most of the inorganic sediments carried by the river are trapped in the darns. This is also leading to the sinking of the deltaic plain because subsidence and eustatic sea level rise are not compensated by new sediments. The high productivity of two bays and the coastal zone adjacent to the delta is related to influx of freshwater from irrigation channels, used in rice cultivation and the river. In the new National Hydrological Plan, a withdrawal of water upstream from the delta of 2012 hm(3)/year (15% of the mean annual discharge) is planned as well as the construction of 49 new reservoirs, mainly for irrigation purposes. A minimum river flow of 100 m(3)/s will be established by the Plan. If the plan is carried through, due to the water abstraction, forecasts based on ecological studies in the area predict: (1) increased presence of the salt wedge in the final 18 km of the river with detrimental effects on river fauna and flora; (2) serious threats to aquaculture and fisheries in the bays; (3) reduction of fish and crayfish production in the platform area; (4) further reductions in sediment and freshwater inputs to delta; (5) salinization of fields under cultivation; and (6) detrimental side effects on deltaic ecosystems.",1995,,WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,31,8,79-86,WOS:A1995RL89100011,10.1016/0273-1223(95)00359-U,,#18049,PRAT 1995,,

Pattern diagrams, which constitute the outcome of several hydro-geochemical processes, have traditionally been used to characterize vulnerability to seawater intrusion. However, the formats of such diagrams do not facilitate the geospatial analysis of groundwater quality, thus limiting the ability of spatio-temporal mapping and monitoring. This raises the need to transform the information from current pattern diagrams into a format that can be readily used under a GIS framework to define vulnerable areas prone to seawater intrusion. In this study, a groundwater quality index specific to seawater intrusion (GQI(SWI)) was developed for the purpose of aggregating data into a comprehensible format that allows spatial analysis.

For investigating long-term development of salinity and water balance during 1961-2099, the one-dimensional Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model was set up and calibrated for a soil column in the area. The model setup involves a deep aquifer as the source of salt through upward seepage. In the vertical salt transport equation, dispersion and advection are included. Six different regional outputs of statistical downscaling methods were used as climate scenarios. These comprise different rates of increasing surface temperature and different trends in seasonal rainfall. The simulation results exhibit opposing salinity trends for topsoil and deeper layers. Although projections of some scenarios entail decreasing salinities near the surface, most of them project a rise in subsoil salinity, with the strongest trends of up to +0.9 mg cm(-3) 100 yr(-1) at -65 cm. The results suggest that topsoil salinity trends in the study area are affected by the magnitude of winter rainfall trends, whereas high subsoil salinities correspond to low winter rainfall and high summer temperature.

In addition to delivering dissolved elements from land to sea, fresh SGD forms a natural barrier against salinization of coastal aquifers. Here we estimate groundwater discharge rates through the near-global coast (60 degrees N to 60 degrees S) at high resolution using a water budget approach. We find that tropical coasts export more than 56% of all fresh SGD, while midlatitude arid regions export only 10%. Fresh SGD rates from tectonically active margins (coastlines along tectonic plate boundaries) are also significantly greater than passive margins, where most field studies have been focused. Active margins combine rapid uplift and weathering with high rates of fresh SGD and may therefore host exceptionally large groundwater-borne solute fluxes to the coast.",2019,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,46,11,5855-5863,WOS:000477616200025,10.1029/2019GL082749,,#18071,Zhou 2019,,

Recent studies have shown that groundwater exploitation also contributes significantly to land subsidence throughout the delta. Thus, combating climate change now makes it necessary to design strategies and policies for adapting to and mitigating climate change and subsidence, not only at the individual level (mainly farmers), but also at the institutional level (province and region). This study aims to build an integrated model for the purpose of exploring the socio-economic impact of adaptation strategies provinces choose under various climate and economic scenarios. The LUCAS-GEMMES model (an agent-based model for strategies for adapting to land-use change in the context of climate change) was developed in order to evaluate socio-economic factors, climate, and water use by farmers, as well as the subsidence dynamics and macroeconomic trends in land-use selection strategies. The simulations are carried out according to four main scenarios: (i) lack of provincial adaptation strategies and absence of subsidence dynamics, (ii) lack of adaptation strategies though subsidence and the impact of land-use production benefits, (iii) purely individual adaptation strategies combined with the impact of subsidence, and (iv) provincial and individual-scale adaptation combined with the impact of subsidence. In all the scenarios that consider subsidence, our results show that early response decisions to even low-level subsidence lead to many positive outcomes in water resource management, such as a significant reduction in water-use in the dry season and a reduction in the area vulnerable to subsidence and climate change. However, the same results also indicate a possible decrease in farmers' income due to reduced agricultural seasons and restricted land-use transformation, which demonstrates the importance of modeling the multi-sectoral aspects of adaptation. Finally, at a more general level, in the fourth scenario, the model clearly shows the benefits when provinces located in the same agro-ecological zone harmonize strategies, thus paving the way for defining integrated land-use policies at the regional level.",2023,,SUSTAINABILITY,15,6,,WOS:000957878700001,10.3390/su15065355,,#18072,Truong 2023,,

Salinities are typically estimated assuming steady-state, neglecting the effect of cyclical forcings on average salinity distributions. Here, numerical modeling is used to test this assumption. Multi-scale fluctuations in sea level (SL) are simulated, from tides to glacial cycles. Results show that high-frequency fluctuations alter average salinities compared with the steady-state distribution produced by average SL. Low-frequency forcing generates discrepancies between present-day salinities estimated with and without considering the cyclical forcing due to overshoot effects. This implies that salinities in coastal aquifers may be erroneously estimated when assuming steady-state conditions, since present distributions are likely part of a dynamic steady state that includes forcing on multiple timescales. Further, typically neglected aquifer storage characteristics can strongly control average salinity distributions. This has important implications for managing vulnerable coastal groundwater resources and for calibration of hydrogeological models.",2022,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,49,11,,WOS:000804026200001,10.1029/2022GL098599,,#18077,Paldor 2022,,

Based on 11 years (2008-2018) of field investigations in a Tunisian coastal oasis, this study simulated the changes in salinity in a coastal aquifer and quantified changes in net irrigation requirement (NIR) of date palm under climate change, considering required changes in leaching requirement. The future salinity in the aquifer was simulated based on sea level rise and changes in aquifer recharge. The study applied a statistical downscaling model (SDSM) to project future climate variables from 2019 to 2050, the SUTRA model to evaluate the change in aquifer salinity, and applied CROPWAT software to calculate NIR. Three climate change scenarios were considered: RCP8.5 (very high emission scenario), RCP6.0 (medium emission scenario) and RCP4.5 (lowest emission scenario). Several useful finding were revealed in this study. First, these three climate change scenarios showed significant trend of increasing annual maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, and a significant decreasing trend of future rainfall. Second, the average aquifer salinity is expected to increase from an average of 4.2 dS m(-1) in 2018 to about 5.3 dS m(-1) in 2050. Seawater intrusion was identified as the main cause for this remarkable increase. Finally, NIR is expected to increase from an average value of 1459 mm year(-1) during 2008-2018 to 1473-1950 mm year(-1) during 2019-2050, depending on climate change scenario applied. Increase in aquifer salinity significantly contributed to this rapid increase of NIR. We believe that our results should be considered in developing adaptation strategies to manage future water resources in coastal areas.",2020,,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,228,,,WOS:000525279000003,10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105843,,#18081,Haj-Amor 2020,,

Knowledge of aquifer hydrological characteristics is therefore essential to managing this water resource. Long-term aquifer monitoring may not always be possible, especially in areas that humans frequent for recreational purposes. However, hydrological information can be deduced from the chemical composition of periodically sampled groundwaters. We characterized the complete chemical composition (temperature, pH, salinity, ORP, O-2 , Na-K-Ca-Mg-Ba-Sr-Si-Cl-SO4-DIC, and DOC) of a brackish karstic spring located along the French Mediterranean coast (La Palme). The salinity of the spring water varied between 4 and 9 during the 2.5 year period of observation. Chemical analyses revealed that the spring is modified from modern seawater, as shown by Na-normalized dissolved element concentrations. Thermodynamic calculations of mineral saturation states (PHREEQC) point to aragonite and barite saturation and elevated equilibrium CO2 partial pressure. The simultaneous salinity minima and oxygen maxima coincide with extreme values of dissolved element concentrations. This indicates that variation in salinity and water chemistry in La Palme coastal aquifer is primarily driven by infiltration of fresh rainwater. This study shows that geochemical investigations can provide an alternative approach to characterizing the hydrological properties of coastal karst aquifers when wells or boreholes are not readily available.",2019,,HYDROLOGY,6,2,,WOS:000474247900017,10.3390/hydrology6020045,,#18084,Monnin 2019,,
1438,Soil Salinity Estimation Over Coastal Wetlands Based on Random Forest Algorithm and Hydrological Connectivity Metric,"Sui, HC; Chen, DW; Yan, JG; Li, B; Li, W; Cui, BS","Owing to climate warming and human activities (irrigation and reservoirs), sea level rise and runoff reduction have been threatening the coastal ecosystem by increasing the soil salinity. However, short-term sparse in situ observations limit the study on the response of coastal soil salinity to external stressors and thus its effect on coastal ecosystem. In this study, based on hydrological connectivity metric and random forest algorithm (RF), we develop a coastal soil salinity inversion model with in situ observations and satellite-based datasets. Using Landsat images and ancillary as input variables, we produce a 30-m monthly grid dataset of surface soil salinity over the Yellow River Delta. Based on the cross-validation result with in situ observations, the proposed RF model performs higher accuracy and stability with determination coefficient of 0.89, root mean square error of 1.48 g center dot kg(-1), and mean absolute error of 1.05 g center dot kg(-1). The proposed RF model can gain the accuracy improvements of about 11-43% over previous models at different conditions. The spatial distribution and seasonal variabilities of soil salinity is sensitive to the changing signals of runoff, tide, and local precipitation. Combining spatiotemporal collaborative information with the hydrological connectivity metric, we found that the proposed RF model can accurately estimate surface soil salinity, especially in natural reserved regions. The modeling results of surface soil salinity can be significant for exploring the effect of seawater intrusion and runoff reduction to the evolution of coastal salt marsh ecosystems.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000807112300001,10.3389/fmars.2022.895172,,#18089,Sui 2022,,

We focused our research on two related anurans with similar ecological niches-Pelobates fuscus and P. syriacus-inhabiting the western Black Sea coast, at the limits of their ranges. We hypothesize that their differences in salinity tolerance are shaping the actual range limits in coastal areas, within the sympatry zone. We quantified experimentally the impact of salinity (range 0-9aEuro degrees) during early ontogeny to ask if salinity can modulate their coexistence, by affecting differently reproductive success and fitness. Exposure to salinity from egg to developmental stage Gosner 25 caused mild to severe malformations and affected survival and size in both species, but the impact was lower in P. syriacus compared to P. fuscus when exposed to salt concentrations of 6aEuro degrees. Embryos of either species did not survive the 9aEuro degrees salinity concentration. We expect that increases in salinization up to 6aEuro degrees could severely reduce the range of P. fuscus, but not P. syriacus, in coastal areas. These results are highly relevant for the conservation of P. fuscus, which is already declining across Europe.",2017,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,792,1,357-366,WOS:000398739000024,10.1007/s10750-016-3074-2,,#18091,Stanescu 2017,,
1441,A Qualitative Assessment of Natural and Anthropogenic Drivers of Risk to Sustainable Livelihoods in the Indian Sundarban,"Banerjee, S; Chanda, A; Ghosh, T; Cremin, E; Renaud, FG","In the Indian Sundarban, multiple attributes and interactions of natural hazards, exposure, and vulnerability pose severe threats to lives and livelihoods. Understanding the cause-and-effect relationships contributing to the risk of loss of sustainable livelihoods has become imperative but has not yet been holistically explored in a single study that provides a broader picture of all possible complex interactions. This study used the impact chain tool to holistically understand the risk that manifests as a result of interactions of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. The secondary literature and authors' observations helped us structure the first draft of the impact chain, which was further developed and validated through fourteen gender-disaggregated interviews with key informants and delta dwellers. This validation process identified the complex interconnections contributing to risk as experienced by experts and delta dwellers, which is seldom reflected through exclusively quantitative data. A quantitative analysis of the qualitative data strongly indicated that tropical cyclones, rainfall variability, and storms are the dominant hazards that affect social-ecological vulnerability manifested through mangrove degradation, land loss due to erosion, and embankment breaching. Social vulnerability is caused by processes and factors that are either directly or indirectly influenced by natural hazards and social-ecological factors. Processes such as increasing seasonal male migration, uncertain agricultural income, and a lack of hazard-resistant housing exacerbates social vulnerability. Embankment breaching, the salinization of land and water, land loss due to erosion, mangrove degradation, land conversion, and groundwater abstraction were identified as the fundamental threats that can lead to a loss of sustainable livelihoods of the people if left unaddressed.",2023,,SUSTAINABILITY,15,7,,WOS:000970369300001,10.3390/su15076146,,#18095,Banerjee 2023,,

Research is needed that helps destinations become more climate ready, including studies of decision factors that influence trip-taking behaviors. This paper presents findings from a discrete choice experiment to determine how physical and economic changes could affect visitation behaviors to a vulnerable coastal destination, the Outer Banks region of North Carolina, USA. We embedded our experiment within an on-site visitor survey to reveal thresholds of negative changes to coastal attributes that tourists are willing to tolerate, and also examined tourists' willingness to substitute their future trips to the region. Transportation-related changes had the highest relative importance among the four selected attributes. The likelihood of three types of spatial substitution, spurred by not being able to access the destination, were consistently related to residency but less consistently related to place meanings, visitation history, and other demographic variables. Study results can inform climate change planning within coastal zones to minimize negative impacts to tourism demand, such as the need to develop creative revenue streams to maintain resilience in communities that rely on occupancy taxes.",2019,,JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM,27,5,629-648,WOS:000468526800002,10.1080/09669582.2019.1599005,,#18101,Seekamp 2019,,
1444,Photogrammetric assessment of shoreline retreat in North Africa: Anthropogenic and natural drivers,"Amrouni, O; Hzami, A; Heggy, E","Shoreline retreat along extended semi-arid areas of North African coasts are indicative of the imbalance of coastal sedimentary processes due to modern abrupt changes in precipitation patterns and urban growth. Monitoring of the diachronic shoreline position and land-use from 1952 to 2018 in the coast of the Hammamet Bay in central-east Tunisia, using both aerial and orbital photogrammetric scenes and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System from 1887 to 2018, suggests shoreline retreat rates ranging from -1.3 to -5.6 m/yr. Such rates are abnormal when compared to the average of -0.07 m/yr suggested by global-scale assessment modeling for sandy beach evolution. These abnormal erosions extend over 65 km of sandy beaches, resulting from a severe deficit of sediment transport caused primarily by rapid coastal urban growth that obstructs sediment flow to the shoreline. We suggest that the high retreat rates observed in the low-population period of 1884-1931 originated mainly from storm surges and tsunamis, or potentially subsidence in the coastal substratum. Moreover, our analysis of the salinity of shallow coastal aquifers and land coverage suggests that shoreline retreat coupled with rapid urban growth accelerated seawater intrusion similar to 5 km inland, causing soil desiccation, the development of salt lakes, and reduction of vegetation coverage by similar to 18%. These abrupt environmental changes have a severe, adverse impact on crop production and food security in these densely populated and economically important areas across significant parts of the North African coasts, sharing similar key environmental parameters with our study site. We conclude that anthropogenic drivers are the major source of shoreline retreat rather than natural ones.",2019,,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,157,,73-92,WOS:000491613300006,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.09.001,,#18106,Amrouni 2019,,
1445,Wave overwash impact on small islands: Generalised observations of freshwater lens response and recovery for multiple hydrogeological settings,"Holding, S; Allen, DM","Wave overwash events have the potential to result in severe consequences to the freshwater resources of small islands as a result of salt contamination of the aquifer. Due to the significant impact of overwash, it is important to characterise the susceptibility of small islands to these events. This study uses numerical modelling to evaluate the freshwater lens response and recovery to overwash events for various island hydrogeological settings (island types) observed worldwide. Models were developed for an example of each island type using a fully coupled surface-subsurface, density-dependent flow and solute transport modelling code. A theoretical overwash event was simulated, and the response and recovery of the freshwater lens were observed for 20 years. The freshwater lens response (degree of aquifer contamination) was largely determined by the vadose zone thickness. Lens recovery ranged from 1 to 19 years for the different island types, and was strongly affected by recharge rate. However, the recovery of potable water in the lens (and restoration of a water supply) was dominantly influenced by geological heterogeneities. The model results demonstrate the cumulative impact of the different factors affecting the freshwater lens response and recovery to the overwash event for each island type, and provide a generalised assessment of island susceptibility to overwash on a global scale, despite limited data availability for many small islands.

We propose an approach for expanding freshwater lenses in saline aquifers adjacent to gaining rivers through the addition of a vertical barrier of low-hydraulic-conductivity (low-K) parallel to the river bank. Sharp-interface analytical solutions for the lens shape and water table distribution are developed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method and are verified using sand tank experiments and numerical simulations. The sensitivity analysis is used to apply the method to parameters typical of the Lower River Murray (South Australia) and its floodplain aquifers. The results show that the barrier can create significant freshwater lenses in head-controlled systems, whereas the barrier may lead to lens shrinkage in flux-controlled systems due to saline water table rise. That is, the effectiveness of the barrier is highly dependent on the inland boundary condition. The analytical solution presented herein can be used to efficiently predict the riparian freshwater lens extent in response to engineered barriers, adding to existing techniques for studying and modifying riparian freshwater lenses.",2020,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,56,2,,WOS:000535672800039,10.1029/2019WR025750,,#18112,Wu 2020,,
1448,Modeling the Evolution of a Freshwater Lens under Highly Dynamic Conditions on a Currently Developing Barrier Island,"Holt, T; Greskowiak, J; Seibert, SL; Massmann, G","The drinking water supply on barrier islands largely depends on freshwater lenses, which are also highly relevant for island ecosystems. The freshwater lens presented in this study is currently developing (since the 1970s) below the very young eastern part of the North Sea barrier island Spiekeroog, the so-called ""Ostplate."" Due to the absence of coastal protection measures, formation, shape, and extent of the freshwater lens below the Ostplate are unaffected by human activities but exposed to dynamic changes, e.g., geomorphological variations and storm tides. The main aim of this paper was to reconstruct the evolution of the freshwater lens over several decades in order to explain the present-day groundwater salinity distribution. In addition, the study assessed the impact of geomorphological variations and storm tides on the freshwater lens formation. Detailed field observations were combined with a transient 2-D density-dependent modeling approach. Both field observations and simulations show an asymmetric freshwater lens after similar to 42 years of formation, whereby the horizontal extent is limited by the elevated dune area. The simulations indicate that the young freshwater lens has nearly reached quasi-steady-state conditions mainly due to the continuous mixing with seawater infiltrating during storm tides, which inhibits further growth of the freshwater lens on the narrow island. The findings further show that (i) a neglection of storm tides results in a significant overestimation of the freshwater lens extent, and (ii) the modeled present groundwater salinity distribution and shape of the freshwater lens are predominantly determined by the position and extent of the elevated dune area at the past similar to 20 years. Hence, annual storm tides have to be directly implemented into numerical models to explain the groundwater salinity distribution and the extent of young freshwater lenses located in highly dynamic tidal environments.",2019,,GEOFLUIDS,2019,,,WOS:000482999900001,10.1155/2019/9484657,,#18113,Holt 2019,,

However, the response of native T. chinensis to its environment is not well known in China. T. chinensis is a useful species in preventing sea water intrusion in coastal areas of northern China. It is necessary to fully understand the relationships between environmental conditions and ecological characteristics of this species to better preserve its habitats. The Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve, one of the major distribution regions of T. chinensis, was then selected as a case study area to investigate the response of this species to water table depth and soil salinity (Na+, Cl-, Mg2+). It was found that sites with shallow water table depths (less than 1.5 m) and low soil salinity (less than 30 psu), provided the best habitat conditions for T. chinensis. The results also showed that plant height, stem diameter, and crown width were all positively correlated to plant age, while they had negative correlations with water table depth. Negative correlations between plant height and soil salinity, plant stem diameter and soil salinity were also concluded. However, no obvious relationship between the crown breadth of T. chinensis and soil salinity was observed. Four types of T. chinensis habitats were obtained based on the ecological characteristics of T. chinensis individuals associated with soil salinity and water table depth, i.e., (1) Low water table with high soil salinity; (2) Deep water table with high soil salinity; (3) Deep water table with low soil salinity; (4) Inundation with low salinity.

1476,Characteristics of soil infiltration in the Tarim River floodplain,"Li, XH; Feng, G; Zhao, CY; Shi, FZ","The ecology in the Tarim River Basin is influenced by inundation of its floodplain. To date, however, there is limited information about the infiltration properties of floodplain soils that are inundated by this river. The aim of this study was to investigate steady-infiltration rates of these soils under four different hydraulic heads (5, 10, 20, and 30 cm). Results showed that the mean infiltration rates were generally high and ranged from 3.17 to 3.50 cm h(-1) when the hydraulic head was between 5 and 30 cm. The steady infiltration increased slightly as the hydraulic head increased. The relationship between the hydraulic head and the infiltration rate can be described by the equation y = 0.0122 x + 3.072, (R-2 = 0.739), where y is the steady-infiltration rate and x is the hydraulic head. There was no significant difference between the infiltration rates for the four different hydraulic heads. The infiltration rate was highest for loamy sand, followed by sandy loam, and was lowest for silt soils. Infiltration was influenced by soil texture and crust, and was low (<1 cm h(-1), hydraulic head of 5 cm) for soils with thick crusts, and high for soils without surface crusts (mean of 6.09 cm h(-1), hydraulic head of 5 cm). The steady-infiltration rate was not influenced by soil organic matter.

The anion and cation trends in the analyzed shallow-tube well and river water are Cl->HCO3->NO3->SO42- and Na+>K+>Ca2+>Mg2+ respectively. The groundwater of the area is of sodium-calcium cation facies and chloride-bicarbonate to carbonate-sulfate anion facies. The river water is of sodium-potassium cation facies and chloride-bicarbonate-sulphate to chloride-sulphate-bicarbonate anion facies. The shallow tube well is contaminated with arsenic which exceeds the WHO recommended value for drinking water (10 mu g/l). The shallow water contains salinity above the standard which is unsuitable for drinking as well as for agricultural activities. The concentration of arsenic, sodium, calcium, potassium, chlorine, bicarbonate, percentage of salinity and specific electrical conductance decreases with increasing depth. The shallow tube well water of the study area is very saline exceeding the permissible limit and requires treatment. The deep tube-well water contains lower amount of arsenic and sodium, lower percentage of salinity and specific electrical conductance in comparison to shallow tube-well water. As a result, the deep tube-well water is free from arsenic toxicity and has low to high salinity hazard, but is also hard that exceeds the tolerable limit of hardness of groundwater for drinking, public health and agricultural purposes and requires softening. The Kapadak river water is highly concentrated with sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, bicarbonate, and specific electrical conductance which cause the deterioration of river water quality for agricultural purposes. According to the values of TDS, EC, boron concentration, Na%, and SAR, the shallow tube-well water as well as river water is of poor quality and unsafe for irrigation purposes, while the deep tube-well water is poorly safe for drinking and irrigation purposes. As a whole in the study area groundwater quality degrades from north to south as southern part is inundated regularly by saline estuarine water.

1498,Outlining an approach to address Geospherical and Biospherical aspects of Coastal Squeeze in the Mediterranean,"Hildinger, A; Braun, A","Sea level changes and growing anthropogenic pressures on coasts worldwide represent a pressing matter that urges investigations across disciplines. The Coastal Squeeze concept is appropriate for this purpose. It addresses coastal dynamics regarding geomorphological and anthropogenic impacts like landward constructions i.e. barrages, with a focus on coastal management. Regarding the role of coastal ecosystems in mitigation to climate change and sea level rise the ecological impacts caused by coastal squeeze can no longer be neglected. The paper develops a research concept to link geospherical and biospherical aspects of Coastal Squeeze within a Mediterranean study site. In order to understand coastal squeeze dynamics along a coastline complex, an integrating approach should address the whole coastline working from a regional to a local scale. The regional scale encompasses coastal types, changes in sea level, sediment supply, flooding, inundation, salt water intrusion and landward barriers (geosphere). On the local scale an integrated approach should take into account significant environmental parameters as they will determine the localization of future coastal ecosystems (biosphere). For the study area a coast of the Mediterranean Sea that is made up of different coastal types, high anthropogenic impacts and micro-tidal dynamics was chosen. Due to also being a biodiversity hotspot this region represents a suitable study site for ecosystem related coastal squeeze research.

The CHW characterises the coastal environment by considering geological layout, wave exposure, tidal range, flora and fauna, sediment balance and storm climate. Application of the CHW identified coastal erosion to present a high to very high influence on the Maltese coastline, with 45.7% of the coast exhibiting a low level of erosion hazard, 12.1% a moderate level, 12.6% a high level and 18.4%, a very high level of erosion hazard.Application of the CHW suggested somewhat higher erosion hazard levels than prior studies using different methodologies; it also confirmed the ease of application of this climate change sensitive coastal hazard identification tool. Management considerations identified a wide range of options the applicability of which is highly dependent on specific coastal configuration and that characterisation of the latter is crucial to allow appropriate management.The study generated management-useful maps describing coastal susceptibility to various hazards and hazard levels. It further provided a description of the entire Maltese coast in terms of ten different coastal configurations that infer management considerations of six coastal characteristics and five hazards.

Big dams have several disadvantages: (a) high costs, (b) possible collapse, (c) evaporation loss, (d) flooding of prime agricultural land, (e) siltation of reservoir, (f) salt-water intrusion in coastal areas, (g) deforestation and 'greenhouse' effect, and (h) destruction of habitat for rare species. We must refine our environmental understanding of how hydropower development affects species, both individually and in their interactions with each other. The utter dependence of organisms on appropriate environments is what frustrates most attempts to proceed with development and still protect ecosystems and wider ecocomplexes. Conservation objectives must be integrated with other objectives in formulating national and other policies, before they crystallize into projects and programmes. When ecological factors are considered only at the end of the process, they are liable to be viewed as obstructing development, which can be disastrously wrong. But if integrated at the basic level of decision-making, they can positively guide development most propitiously and beneficially. Translated to the global context, this is best served by holistic thinking.Developing countries face severe challenges in dealing with planning, conservation, and wise use of resources. The stimulus given by hydropower developments to ecological and limnological research can provide a valuable infrastructure which can be used to promote future effective multi-objective environmental evaluation, especially in truly developing countries. Multi-objective planning must also include sociological impacts for sufficient understanding for innovative treatment of the complex interrelationships between the components of the environment. Environmentally well-designed, and meticulously carried out, integrated research should play a fundamental role as the basis of deciding for the future the renewable and sustainable needs and wise use of our often limited resources.",1995,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,22,4,352-358,WOS:A1995UG62700011,10.1017/S0376892900034925,,#18405,Alam 1995,,
1503,Seasonal predictability of high sea level frequency using ENSO patterns along the US West Coast,"Khouakhi, A; Villarini, G; Zhang, W; Slater, LJ","High sea levels can be conducive to coastal flooding, coastal erosion and inland salt-water intrusion, and thus pose a significant threat to coastal communities, ecosystems and coastal assets. Increases in high water levels have been attributed largely to rising mean sea levels associated with intra-seasonal to interannual climate modes of variability such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we examine the predictability of the seasonal frequency of high sea levels using the Nino3.4 index. Different high sea level quantities are considered at 23 tide gauges along the U.S. West Coast, including storm surge and nuisance (minor) floods. At each site, we develop a statistical probabilistic forecasting model for seasonal high sea level frequency during the cold period of October-March. As predictors, we compare the use of (1) seasonal Nino3.4 index observations over the warm antecedent period of July-September and (2) seasonal Nino3.4 index forecasts from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) over the cold concurrent period of October-March. Results indicate that the Nino3.4 observations are a good predictor of seasonal high sea level frequency, especially for predicting the storm surge frequency. Correlation coefficients between the observed and modelled seasonal storm surge frequency range from 0.6 to 0.95 at most of the 23 tide gauges. In the predictive model, when using NMME Nino3.4 index, correlation coefficients range between approximately 0.4 and 0.7 at the southern gauges for Nino3.4 index forecasts initialized from October to June (the skill decreases with lead time). Our results provide insights into the seasonal predictability of high sea levels using ENSO patterns which is important for planning and coastal management.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,131,,,WOS:000485107000018,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.07.007,,#18407,Khouakhi 2019,,

1529,Plant Responses to Abiotic Stresses in Sustainable Agriculture,"Zlatev, ZS","In recent decades the significance of sustainable agriculture has risen to become one of the most important directions in agriculture. In both conventional and sustainable agriculture, plants are exposed to abiotic and biotic factors of the environment. These include factors such as drought, flooding, low temperature, heat, high light intensity, UV-B radiation and soil salinization. Environmental factors that limit plant growth and development are considered as stress factors. Maintaining growth and crop productivity under adverse environmental stresses is presumably the major challenge facing sustainable agriculture. Better understanding physiological and biochemical mechanisms of plant acclimation to stress conditions, and the relationship between plants and environment is the first step to meet this challenge.In this chapter recent information about the plant physiological reaction to different abiotic stress -factors, as well as physiological and biochemical bases of acclimation are analysed. It is now known that tolerance to abiotic stress is complex and many authors suggest that the plasticity of cell metabolism and its fast acclimation to changes in environmental conditions is a main essential step in stress tolerance.",2015,,ABIOTIC STRESSES IN CROP PLANTS,,,196-211,WOS:000377028700013,10.1079/9781780643731.0000,,#18572,Zlatev 2015,,
1531,Soil degradation and land use,"Pagliai, M","The main aspects of environmental degradation that involve soil (erosion, soil compaction, soil crusting, deterioration of soil structure, flooding, losses of organic matter, salinization, onsite and offsite damages, etc.) result from human activities. Since conventional agricultural production systems have resulted in excessive erosion and soil degradation, change is needed that will control such ruin.Scientific results have clearly shown that agricultural management systems can play an important role in preventing soil degradation provided that appropriate management practices are adopted. Long-term field experiments in different types of soils have shown that alternative tillage systems, such as minimum tillage, ripper subsoiling, etc., improve the soil structural quality. Continuous conventional tillage causes a decrease in soil organic matter content associated with a decrease in aggregate stability, leading, as a consequence, to the formation of surface crusts, with an increase in runoff and erosion risk.In hilly environments, land leveling and scraping are dangers to soil, causing its erosion.. After leveling, slopes being prepared for planting (particularly vineyards) are almost always characterized by the presence of large amounts of jumbled earth materials accumulated by the scraper. In this vulnerable condition, a few summer storms can easily cause soil losses exceeding 500 Mg ha(-1)year(-1). Moreover, land leveling and the resulting soil loss cause drastic alteration of the landscape and loss of the cultural value of the soil.Subsoil compaction is strongly underevaluated, even though the presence of a ploughpan at the lower limit of cultivation is largely widespread in the alluvial soils of the plains cultivated by monoculture. It is responsible for the frequent flooding of such plains when heavy rains concentrate in a short time (rainstorm), since the presence of this ploughpan strongly reduces drainage. Alternative tillage practices, like ripper subsoiling, are able to avoid the formation of this compact layer.",2004,,BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND MIGRATION,,,273-280,WOS:000223347700027,,,#18583,Pagliai 2004,,
1532,Environmentally sensitive areas and indicators of desertification,"Kosmas, C; Tsara, M; Moustakas, N; Kosma, D; Yassoglou, N","Desertification is the consequence of a series of important processes in the Mediterranean environments, especially in semi-arid and and regions, where water is the main limiting factor of land use performance oil ecosystems. Among the most important processes of desertification are soil erosion and salinization particularly affecting hilly areas and lowlands, respectively. Various methodologies have been developed in identifying and mapping environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) to desertification. Studies have shown that the various types of ESAs have different behavior on crop production, plant growth, grazing capacity, and soil erosion rates. For example, olive oil and cereal production decreased as the type of ESA changes from non-threatened to critical areas. Soil erosion measures have shown that soil erosion rates increased as the sensitivity of land to desertification increased. Loss in land productivity greatly affects farmer's income and measures applied for protecting the land from further degradation and desertification.The necessity of elaborating indicators is one of the priorities identified by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The use of indicators can generally simplify complex processes and provide appropriate tools for combating desertification. Indicators can be classified to those related a) to the physical environment (soil, vegetation, climate), b) to the land management (tillage operations, irrigation practices, animal density grazing the land, forest fire protection, erosion measures, etc), and c) to the socio-economic characteristics (farmer age, family size, farm size, subsidies, farmer income, etc). Indicators can be better used for defining land desertification risk if they are classified according to the land use type. For example important indicators for defining desertification risk for vineyards are related to land management as well as to land characteristics such as tillage operations, tillage direction, slope gradient, parent material, plant cover, etc. Studies, conducted in areas in which the main process of desertification was salinization, showed that important indicators for defining desertification risk were ground water depth, drainage, water quality, frequency of flooding, distance from the seashore, type of land use, rainfall, etc.",2006,,DESERTIFICATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION.

1536,Intermittent hydrologic perturbations control solute cycling and export in the Okavango Delta,"Ramatlapeng, GJ; Atekwana, EA; Molwalefhe, L; Oromeng, KV","We measured the concentrations of the total dissolved ions (TDI), dissolved silica, major cations and the delta D and delta O-18 at sub-weekly intervals for one year in the Okavango River at the outlet of the Okavango Delta (Delta). Our objectives were to (1) document the temporal variations in the concentrations of solutes in the Okavango River, (2) determine the processes controlling the transfer of solutes to the river and (3) assess the temporal solute load and outflux from the Delta. We found that the TDI and major cation concentrations in the river were anomalously high during the rainy season and before the arrival of the annual flood pulse. The anomalous increases in the solute concentrations are due to dissolution and mobilization of precipitated salts stored in the floodplains and on hundreds of thousands of islands scattered across the Delta wetlands, as well as from 'flushing' of remnant evaporated flood water of higher salinity trapped in isolated wetland pools. Overland flow generated by local rains and flooding connect the river to the solute stores in the watershed. The temporally activated hydrologic flow pathways transfer solutes to the river that flushes them out of the Delta. The solute load in the river was higher during the rainy season and during pulse flooding, and mimicked the discharge hydrograph. We estimate that 17,838 Mg/y of dissolved solutes was flushed out of the Delta, with 67% removed during pulse flooding (6 months) and 30% during the rainy season (4 months). The transfer of solutes from the watershed to the river during pulse flooding and the rainy season, and solute export from the Delta is an important mechanism that keeps the Delta's surface water resources fresh, which is critical for supporting a freshwater wetland ecosystem. Our results highlight the importance of intermittent activation of hydrologic flow pathways in controlling solute cycling in this and other arid watersheds.",2021,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,594,,,WOS:000641589600071,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125968,,#18637,Ramatlapeng 2021,,
1545,Assessing causes and identifying solutions for high groundwater levels in a highly managed irrigated region,"Deng, CD; Bailey, RT","High groundwater levels in urban and irrigated areas around the world can lead to infrastructure damage, land degradation, and crop yield reduction. Causes can include groundwater flooding due to fluvial processes, excess rainfall and irrigation, inadequate subsurface drainage, and additional sources such as injection and seepage from earthen canals and recharge ponds. The principal causes of shallow water tables, however, are difficult to quantify due to the inter-connectedness of all possible causes. This paper presents a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in highly managed, irrigated stream-aquifer systems, using a combination of numerical groundwater flow modeling and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) tools. A tested MODFLOW groundwater model and Sobol GSA methods are used to simulate and then quantify the influence of all major groundwater stresses on water table elevation for a region in northern Colorado, USA experiencing high groundwater levels, with results showing that recharge from surface water irrigation, canal seepage, and groundwater pumping have the strongest influence on water table elevation, whereas precipitation recharge and recharge from groundwater irrigation have small influences. Time series sensitivity plots quantify the seasonality of these influences over a decadal period, and spatial sensitivity plots indicate regions that are strongly influenced by individual stresses. Results from best management practice (BMP) implementation indicate that limiting canal seepage and transitioning > 50 % of cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1.5m-3m over a 5-year period, leading to beneficial conditions for crop growth in the root zone and dewatering of subsurface infrastructure. These methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide. However, proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local, state, or national water law.",2020,,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,240,,,WOS:000546646400030,10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106329,,#18657,Deng 2020,,
1554,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION - TOWARDS A WAY OF THINKING AND ACTING,"STAPP, WB; POLUNIN, N","Our world of Mankind and Nature is becoming more and more seriously threatened as human populations and profligacy increase.  Yet short of near-future calamity, there should be hope in global environmental education as a basis for countering such threats as those of world hunger, acidic precipitation, increasing desertification, nuclear proliferation, 'greenhouse' warming, and stratospheric ozone depletion.  We need to educate people throughout the world to see these dangers in their global context and to act always within this perspective - be they decision-makers, legislators, or mere private citizens.  For their actions and effects compound to make up those of their pandominant species, the likes of which our unique planet Earth can surely never have experienced before, and consequently its all-important Biosphere, constituting virtually the whole of our and Nature's life-support, is totally unprepared to withstand.The above means that decisions and concomitant actions at the personal level can and often do affect the globe, to however infinitesimal a degree, and of this all people on Earth should be forewarned, acting on it with clear understanding and due responsibility.  Particularly North Americans should realize that their effect is disproportionately large, as they use some 36% of the world's resources although comprising only about 6% of its population.  Towards remedying such anomalies and effecting an improved sharing of responsibility among all the world's human inhabitants, an urgent need is, clearly, effective global environmental education.  We need a world of concerned people with the knowledge that personal decisions and local actions can affect others very widely, and that each individual human being thus has a role in furthering solutions to environmental, as well as political and social problems.With the need for such thinking and action so clear, and the stakes so very high, why is it that global perspectives are not better integrated into today's educational system?  'The answer is that the barriers to such integration and concomitant action are many and strong, and due understanding of holism's fundamental importance is barely beginning to sweep our prejudice-bound world.'  These barriers include lack of student interest and pertinent enrolment, lack of international perspective among teachers and in the general press, and lack of television and other news-media coverage of such real world affairs.  A general obstacle lies in the tendency of educational efforts to emphasize differences rather than similarities - scarcely conducive to fostering an interdependent, one-world ethic.  Yet global issues should be our ultimate consideration, and holistic practice our means of furthering them for lasting survival.It is clear that we humans no longer have the option of foregoing a global perspective, and that there is dire need for widely-increased global environmental education to inculcate greatly-increased respect and concern for the world environment.  This is brought starkly to mind on realization that practically all the horrors which now beset our world were known fairly widely already twenty years ago - including threats to the stratospheric ozone shield, the 'greenhouse effect' on world climate, the effects of deforestation and devegetation with ever-increasing human population pressures, and many more - and that new ones keep on emerging.  These latter include build-up of nuclear-waste and other pollutions, AIDS, ever-increasing acidic deposition and salinization, flooding of lowlands and other effects of climatic changes, and further foreseeable problems that are likewise of our own making in being due to human overpopulation, ignorance, and/or profligacy.",1991,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,18,1,13-18,WOS:A1991GA77400005,10.1017/S037689290002124X,,#18671,STAPP 1991,,
1557,Effects of sea level rise on salinity and tidal flooding patterns in the Guadiana Estuary,"Mills, L; Janeiro, J; Martins, F","Sea level rise is a worldwide concern as a high percentage of the population accommodates coastal areas. The focus of this study is the impact of sea level rise in the Guadiana Estuary, an estuary in the Iberian Peninsula formed at the interface of the Guadiana River and the Gulf of Cadiz. Estuaries will be impacted by sea level rise as these transitional environments host highly diverse and complex marine ecosystems. The major consequences of sea level rise are the intrusion of salt from the sea into fresh water and an increase in flooding area. As the physical, chemical, and biological components of estuaries are sensitive to changes in salinity, the purpose of this study is to further evaluate salt intrusion in the Guadiana Estuary caused by sea level rise. Hydrodynamics of the Guadiana Estuary were simulated in a two-dimensional numerical model with the MOHID water modeling system. A previously developed hydrodynamic model was implemented to further examine changes in salinity distribution in the estuary in response to sea level rise. Varying tidal amplitudes, freshwater discharge from the Guadiana River and bathymetries of the estuary were incorporated in the model to fully evaluate the impacts of sea level rise on salinity distribution and flooding areas of the estuary. Results show an overall increase in salinity and land inundation in the estuary in response to sea level rise.",2021,,JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE,12,7,2933-2947,WOS:000634686100001,10.2166/wcc.2021.202,,#18692,Mills 2021,,
1559,Changes in plant communities of low-salinity tidal marshes in response to sea-level rise,"Humphreys, A; Gorsky, AL; Bilkovic, DM; Chambers, RM","As sea-level rises, low-salinity tidal marshes experience greater flooding with more saline water. In the Chesapeake Bay estuary, we compared the 1980 and 2014 tidal marsh inventories (TMIs) of plant communities from James City County, Virginia, USA, with respect to the spatial distribution of two species-the invasive reed Phragmites australis and native salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora-plus overall species richness. Since the 1980 TMI, the total area of low-salinity tidal marshes in which P. australis occurred increased from 0.46 km(2) to 6.30 km(2) in 2014. Between TMIs, however, the total area of low-salinity marshes occupied by S. alterniflora increased by only 0.02 km(2). Species richness in low-salinity tidal marshes decreased from 41 to 25 between TMIs. To assess seedling emergence under increased flooding and salinity, we completed two seed bank germination experiments using soil samples collected from six low-salinity marshes containing established P. australis stands. In the first experiment, more seedlings emerged in the two low-salinity (0 vs. 5 ppt) treatments after seven weeks, irrespective of flooding (water 3.75 cm below vs. at soil surface), but no P. australis or S. alterniflora germinated. For the second experiment, we added seeds of P. australis and S. alterniflora to soils exposed to the same flooding and salinity treatments to test the impact of these plant competitors on seedling emergence. No difference in number of seedlings was detected among treatments, but the number of species and their relative abundance was significantly affected by flooding (ANOSIM, R = 0.138, P < 0.001). The presence of P. australis and S. alterniflora seedlings appeared to shift the physical factor more influential on seedling emergence from salinity to flooding. For both seed bank experiments, more seedlings but not more species emerged from soils collected from marshes where P. australis coverage was P. australis and S. alterniflora-a trend expected to continue here and in other riverine estuaries of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.",2021,,ECOSPHERE,12,7,,WOS:000678730500014,10.1002/ecs2.3630,,#18752,Humphreys 2021,,
1560,Incorporating Groundwater Levels into Sea-Level Detection Models for Hawaiian Anchialine Pool Ecosystems,"Marrack, L","As sea levels rise, the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems are expected to change. In many coastal aquifers, fresher groundwater floats on top of denser saltwater and will rise with sea level. Under these conditions, ecosystems dependent on groundwater may shift inland as a result of inundation, changes in salinity, or both. Groundwater-fed anchialine pool habitats existing in porous coastal substrates around the world have not been assessed for sea-level rise impacts. As a first step toward examining ecosystem response to rising water levels, geospatial models were developed to detect anchialine pools on the island of Hawai'i at current water levels and models were validated with known pool locations. Specifically, the objectives were to determine whether accounting for groundwater levels in the model improved pool detection, to identify the model that most accurately detected known pools, and to identify which pool features make some pools more likely to be detected than others. Six water level models were validated with the test data set of actual pool locations to determine how well they detected known anchialine pools. Water surface models that included groundwater levels were up to 37% better at detecting anchialine pools than corresponding models without groundwater levels. The model that included groundwater levels at mean higher high water was applied to 42 km of coastline where it correctly detected 62% of known pools. A generalized linear model showed that pools with surface areas greater than 5 m(2) and pools without canopy were the most likely to be detected. Future predictive modeling of anchialine pool response to sea-level rise should include groundwater levels. Furthermore, geospatial models aimed at predicting ecosystem shifts due to sea level rise may be improved by including groundwater as a factor and should be validated using current ecosystem conditions.",2015,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,31,5,1170-1182,WOS:000360936200013,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00043.1,,#18757,Marrack 2015,,
1562,"Will inundation and salinity levels associated with projected sea level rise reduce the survival, growth, and reproductive capacity of Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed)?","Woo, I; Takekawa, JY","In the San Francisco Bay Estuary, CA, USA, sea level rise (SLR) is projected to increase by 1.4 m during the next 90 years resulting in increased inundation and salt water intrusion up-estuary. Since inundation and salinity are critical factors that drive vegetation structure and composition in coastal wetlands, we asked whether inundation and salinity levels associated with SLR would reduce the survival, growth, and reproductive capacity of a dominant halophyte, Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed). We conducted a 4 x 4 factorial greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of a range of inundation periods (25, 50, 75, and 100%) and water salinities (0, 10, 20, 30 psu) on individual S. pacifica adults and seedlings. We found that inundation and salinity treatments affected the height of adults and seedlings combined. When examined separately, adult height was negatively affected by inundation >= 75%, while seedling height was affected by the interaction of both inundation and salinity. Adult belowground biomass was negatively affected by complete inundation. Seedling aboveground biomass decreased 46% at the highest salinity (30 psu) and belowground biomass decreased at salinities >= 20 psu. Adult flower production was not affected by treatments but was reduced by 38% at 30 psu salinity for seedlings. While adult survival was 99%, seedling survival was 56% with greatest mortality at low (25%) inundation, possibly because their roots were more susceptible to desiccation. Vegetation structure of the marsh platform comprised of S. pacifica adults will be susceptible to greater inundation rates associated with SLR. Our results suggest that adults may grow less tall, thus altering the vegetation structure and likely the tidal marsh wildlife that rely on these habitats.

1564,Saltwater Transport under the Influence of Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Multilayered Aquifers,"Guo, QN; Zhang, YH; Zhou, ZF; Zhao, Y","The dynamic behavior of groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal multilayered aquifers is affected by sea-level rise (SLR). Two sets of laboratory experiments were completed that took into account SLR (seawater rising from 85 to 105 cm for scenario 1 and inland head decreasing from 100 to 80 cm for scenario 2). Groundwater flow and salt transport in the multilayered aquifers were observed during the experiment. SEAWAT software was used to validate the processes of seawater transport in the coastal multilayered aquifer under the influence of SLR. The hydrogeological parameters were identified by fitting the observed values of groundwater level and salinity in the model. The influences of aquifer heterogeneity, SLR, and boundary condition on solute mixing of saltwater and freshwater were described. Results showed that the transient toe penetration x(toe) and area of the seawater wedge increased initially and then tended to stabilize as the seawater level increased in each stage of both scenarios. The spreading rate of the seawater wedge during the process of releasing water in scenario 2 was faster than that of storing water in scenario 1, although the difference between sea level and inland boundary head was the same in the two scenarios. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated parameters were reasonable. Moreover, the variation of the seawater wedge could not be reproduced well when the hydraulic conductivities and saltwater density of the upper and lower layers were increased or decreased. The analysis provided insights into how SLR and inland water head influence seawater intrusion rate and area.",2020,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,36,5,1040-1049,WOS:000571455700012,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00189.1,,#18817,Guo 2020,,
1566,Defining estuarine squeeze: The loss of upper estuarine transitional zones against in-channel barriers through saline intrusion,"Little, S; Lewis, JP; Pietkiewicz, H","Here we define, for the first time, the concept of estuarine squeeze and lay out recommendations for the consistent use of terminology for this new but critical research area. Climate and catchment-driven reductions in river flow together with rising sea levels are increasing estuarine salinities and driving saltwater into upper estuarine zones. This saline intrusion is exacerbated in regions where land level is falling (i.e. relative sea level rise) and in catchments subject to high freshwater demand and water regulation, which reduces river flow. In unmodified systems, many estuaries would naturally migrate inland in response to sea level rise. However, es-tuaries are some of the most anthropogenically impacted ecosystems in the world, being settlement and devel-opment hubs due to the ecosystem services they provide. To protect these assets, many estuaries have man-made in-channel barriers (such as dams, weirs and sluices) at their inland tidal limits, a trend that is likely to continue in the future to protect against the impacts of climate change. As sea levels rise and river flows reduce, saltwater will move further inland. This increasing saline intrusion will be most detrimental for upper estuarine, low salinity (oligohaline) and tidal freshwater zones, which will progressively become 'squeezed out' against these barriers. We have termed this concept 'estuarine squeeze' and define this as 'the progressive loss of extent of upper estuarine tidal freshwater and oligohaline zones against in-channel man-made barriers through saline intrusion and increasing salinities driven by relative sea level rise and/or reductions in river flow'. A lack of research into the structure and functioning of tidal freshwater zones in particular means that the impact of their reduction and/or loss on the wider estuary is unknown. However, there are indications that these zones may play a key role in estuarine biogeochemical cycling, habitat provision, primary and secondary production, food-web functioning, and the provision of trophic subsidies to the brackish estuary and coastal zone. Loss and/or reduction of these zones through estuarine squeeze may therefore result in a net loss of function, with critical implications for the ability of estuaries to continue to provide key ecosystem services into the future.",2022,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,278,,,WOS:000880382200002,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108107,,#18857,Little 2022,,

The Byeonsan2 groundwater monitoring well for seawater intrusion was selected for the study. A total of 15 scenarios, including the baseline period (2005-2015), were made based on SLR projections and estimated freshwater recharge rates. The changes in salinity relative to the baseline at the monitoring well for each scenario were investigated through the SUTRA model. From the scenario of 0.57 m SLR with a freshwater recharge rate of 0.0058 kg s(-1), the largest salinity increase (40.3%) was simulated.

Walvis Bay is an arid, semi-desert environment with most of the town lying 2 m above mean sea level. The town is sheltered by a large sandy spit from the prevailing wave climate, which, on the open coast, can be quite severe. The area has an exceedingly dynamic sediment budget and is completely reliant on a small coastal aquifer for freshwater. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of semi-sheltered environments to sea level rise and the need for accurate sediment budgeting in any Potential Impact Assessment. Four categories of potential impact are considered; increased coastal erosion, flooding and inundation, increased saline intrusion and raised water-tables and lastly reduced protection from extreme events. The effect of increased coastal erosion is found to have limited impact on the town but the remaining three potential impacts could have serious consequences, especially the threat from extreme events. Nine years of hourly tide gauge data were analysed using the Joint Probabilities Method and water level return frequency curves were drawn. A 20 cm rise in sea level was found to be sufficient to raise the annual occurrence water level to above that of a current 1 in 100 year event. A future 1 in 10 year storm, after a 20 cm rise, would attain a higher water level than that which could be reached by a 1 in 1,000 year event now. This Potential Impact Assessment provides an analogue for other environments which may be sheltered from the effects of coastal erosion such as low lying tidal inlets and estuaries.",1992,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,8,4,868-881,WOS:A1992KX28800009,,,#18872,HUGHES 1992,,
1570,"Recharge mechanism and salinization processes in coastal aquifers in Nam Dinh province, Vietnam","Hoan, HV; Larsen, F; Nhan, PQ; Long, TV; Giang, NTT","In Nam Dinh province, in the Red River delta plain in Northern Vietnam, groundwater in the shallow Holocene aquifer shows elevated total dissolved solids up to 35 km from the coastline, indicating a saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Tonkin. High groundwater salinities have been encountered below and adjacent to the Red River in the deep Pleistocene aquifer. Since 1996, large-scale groundwater abstraction was initiated from the deep aquifer, and the observed elevated salinities now raise concerns about whether the groundwater abstraction is undertaken sustainably. We have conducted a study to obtain a fundamental understanding of the recharge mechanisms and salinization processes in the Nam Dinh province. A holistic approach with multiple methods including transient electromagnetic sounding and borehole logging, exploratory drilling, sampling and analyzing primary ion and stable isotope compositions of water and pore water, groundwater head monitoring, hydraulic experiments laboratory of clay layers, and groundwater modeling by using the SEAWAT code. Results reveal that saline river water is leached from the Red River and its distributaries into the shallow aquifers. The distribution and occurrence of salty pore water in the Holocene aquitard clay shows that meteoric water has not been flowing through these low permeable clay layers. Marine pore water has, however, been leached out of the Pleistocene clay. When this layer is present, it offers protection of the lower aquifer against high salinity water from above. Salinity as high as 80 % of oceanic water is observed in interstitial pore water of the transgressive Holocene clay. Saltwater is transported into the Pleistocene aquifer, where the Holocene clay is directly overlying the aquifer.",2022,,VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES,44,2,213-238,WOS:000810593600001,10.15625/2615-9783/16864,,#18875,Hoan 2022,,
1571,Responses of estuarine salinity and transport processes to potential future sea-level rise in the Chesapeake Bay,"Hong, B; Shen, J","Understanding the changes of hydrodynamics in estuaries with respect to magnitudes of sea-level rise is important to understanding the changes of biogeochemical processes that are coupled tightly with the physical processes. Based on the 21st century sea-level rise scenarios projected by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), the Chesapeake Bay was chosen as a prototype to study the responses of the estuary to potential future sea-level rise. The numerical model results show that the average salt content, salt intrusion length, and stratification will increase as sea level rises. The changes of these parameters have obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations. Both the salt content and stratification show more increase in spring (following the high-flow periods) and wet years than in autumn (following the low-flow periods) and dry years. The salt intrusion length has larger increase and greater standard deviation in autumn than in spring. The transport time scales are used to illustrate the variations of transport processes as sea level rises, and results indicate that (1) the exchange flow would be strengthened but the downstream transport of fresh water would be slower; (2) the residence time of the Bay would increase due to the increased volume and change of circulation; (3) the vertical transport time (reference to water surface) has more pronounced increase and the volume of water mass with different age groups increases with different rates. As a result, the retention time of dissolved substances in the Bay would increase. Although the increased tidal currents would strengthen the vertical mixing, the increased stratification would weaken the vertical exchange. The increase of vertical transport time is due to the impact of stratification changes, which overwhelms the impact of tidal changes. As the bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) supply is predominated by the vertical exchanges in the Chesapeake Bay, the increased upstream transport time has a weak impact on hypoxia conditions in the middle and upper portions of the Bay. The weakened vertical exchange would result in less DO supply from the surface to the bottom layer.

1575,"Hydrodynamic modeling and analysis of sea-level rise impacts on salinity for oyster growth in Apalachicola Bay, Florida","Huang, WR; Hagen, S; Bacopoulos, P; Wang, DB","In this study, a previously calibrated hydrodynamic model was applied to investigate the impacts of sea level rise on salinity variations and oyster growth in Apalachicola Bay. With available observed data (winds, tides, and river flow), a case study has been conducted for the period of June 10 July 9, 2005. In addition, sea level rise impacts under a range of river flow conditions have also been examined, which include minimum monthly flow, average monthly flow, and maximum monthly flow based on the flow data from 1977 to 2013. Referring to the case study conditions under the existing sea level, model simulations were conducted to examine salinity changes in the bay in response to the sea level rise scenarios of 0.31 m, 0.5 m and 1.0 m. SLR-induced saline water intrusion mainly enters the estuary from the large opening in the east boundary. Based on the optimal salinity range for oyster growth (20-25 at Cat Point and 17-26 at Dry Bar) in Apalachicola Bay, SLR impacts were evaluated based on the model predicted salinity at Dry Bay and Cat Point. Results indicate that sea level rise results in stronger impacts on Cat Point than Dry Bar. Under the flow conditions of average monthly flow and the observed daily flow during June 10 July 9, mean salinity at Dry Bar varies within 21-24 in the optimal salinity range under 031 m and 0.5 m SLR conditions; and further increase above 26.0 when SLR is equal to 1.0 m. Under the conditions of average monthly flow and the observed daily flow during June 10 July 9, the mean salinity at Cat Point is within the optimal range under existing sea level, and increases above the maximum optimal salinity of 27 under the SLR scenarios of 0.31 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m, respectively. Extreme low and high flow conditions have also been investigated to examine the combined effects of flow and SLR. At the same sea level rise conditions, salinity under minimum flow is much higher than those under average flow, while salinity under maximum flow is much lower than those under the average flow condition.

1580,"Compound Inundation Impacts of Coastal Climate Change: Sea-Level Rise, Groundwater Rise, and Coastal Precipitation","Rahimi, R; Tavakol-Davani, H; Graves, C; Gomez, A; Valipour, MF","The importance of considering the compound effects of multiple hazards has increased in recent years due to their catastrophic impacts on human lives and property. Compound effects correspond to events with multiple concurrent or consecutive drivers, e.g., heavy storms, coastal flooding, high tides, and sea level rise (SLR). There is a recent evidence on inundation caused by SLR-driven groundwater rise, and there is a distinct knowledge gap in understanding the compound inundation effects of this phenomenon considering the important hydrologic and hydraulic considerations under compound events. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a novel analytical framework to understand the movements of the surface flow under typical precipitation events considering their interaction with uprising groundwater and SLR in a coastal watershed located in Oakland Flatlands, CA, USA, home to several disadvantaged communities. This modelling approach simulates the dynamics of compound flooding in two dimensions of the earth surface in a fine resolution, which is critical for devising proper flood management strategies. The reason to focus on disadvantaged coastal communities is that such communities typically encounter disproportionate environmental injustices due to the lack of sufficient drainage capacity in their infrastructure. Our results show that by considering the compound effect of SLR, groundwater inundation and precipitation flooding, the drainage capacity of infrastructure will be substantially exceeded, such that over 700 acres of the built infrastructure could be flooded. This is a considerable increase compared to scenarios that do not consider compound effect, or scenarios that consider inappropriate combinations of driving factors. In sum, our results highlight the significance of considering compound effects in the coastal inundation analyses, with a particular emphasis on the role of groundwater rise.",2020,,WATER,12,10,,WOS:000586177400001,10.3390/w12102776,,#18934,Rahimi 2020,,
1581,Spacial Distribution of Salinity and the Mechanism of Saltwater Intrusion in the Modaomen Water Channel of Pear River Estuary,"Liu, JB; Bao, Y","Modaomen channel is an important fresh water resource in Pearl River Delta. It has been impacted by saltwater intrusion frequently in the last decade. This has drawn more and more attention from scientists and engineers. The hydrodynamic mechanism of saltwater intrusion is still impercipient. In the present paper, hydrographs of velocity and salinity in the channel are analyzed based on field observations of velocity and salinity of upper, middle, and lower water layers at several stations along the Modaomen channel. It is found that the transport of salinity in Modaomen channel is obviously different from other estuaries. As the tidal range increases from neap to spring tide, the salinity in each water layer decreases unexpectedly. This peculiar phenomenon is attributed to the extraordinary flow process in the channel. When salinity value in each layer and vertical salinity gradient are lower during spring tide, no matter on rising or ebbing tide, the flow velocity monotonously decreases from water surface to the bottom, which is suggested by common sense. However, when salinity values and vertical salinity gradient are higher during neap tide, the flow velocity unexpectedly increases from water surface to the bottom during flood period, and flood duration of the bottom current is surprisingly as long as 15-18 hours. In addition, an inflexional velocity profile may remain amazingly for about 9 hours. This could be driven by the baroclinic pressure under the condition of tides, topography and upstream runoff discharge of this channel.",2011,,RECENT PROGRESSES IN FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH - PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FLUID MECHANICS,1376,,,WOS:000302054700106,,,#18943,Liu 2011,,
1582,Sea Level Rise Impacts on Wastewater Treatment Systems Along the US Coasts,"Hummel, MA; Berry, MS; Stacey, MT","As sea levels rise, coastal communities will experience more frequent and persistent nuisance flooding, and some low-lying areas may be permanently inundated. Critical components of lifeline infrastructure networks in these areas are also at risk of flooding, which could cause significant service disruptions that extend beyond the flooded zone. Thus, identifying critical infrastructure components that are exposed to sea level rise is an important first step in developing targeted investment in protective actions and enhancing the overall resilience of coastal communities. Wastewater treatment plants are typically located at low elevations near the coastline to minimize the cost of collecting consumed water and discharging treated effluent, which makes them particularly susceptible to coastal flooding. For this analysis, we used geographic information systems to assess the exposure of wastewater infrastructure to various sea level rise projections at the national level. We then estimated the number of people who would lose wastewater services, which could be more than five times as high as previous predictions of the number of people at risk of direct flooding due to sea level rise. We also performed a regional comparison of wastewater exposure to marine and groundwater flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area. Overall, this analysis highlights the widespread exposure of wastewater infrastructure in the United States and demonstrates that local disruptions to infrastructure networks may have far-ranging impacts on areas that do not experience direct flooding.Plain Language Summary Wastewater treatment plants are susceptible to flooding resulting from sea level rise. Previous estimates of wastewater exposure have only considered the impacts of marine flooding at the local or regional scale. In this analysis, we quantify the exposure to marine flooding across the coastal United States and then consider the relative impacts of marine and groundwater flooding at the regional scale in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also estimate the number of people who may lose access to wastewater services if no actions are taken to prevent flooding at wastewater treatment plants. We find that the number of people impacted by sea level rise due to loss of wastewater services could be five times as high as previous predictions of the number of people who experience direct flooding of their homes or property. We also find that groundwater flooding poses a significant threat to wastewater plants in the San Francisco Bay region.",2018,,EARTHS FUTURE,6,4,622-633,WOS:000431986000002,10.1002/2017EF000805,,#18945,Hummel 2018,,
1583,NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SALTWATER INTRUSION IN A LOCK WITH LONG CANAL ADOPTING COUPLED BOX MODEL AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL,"Yang, QY; Zhai, JJ; Jiang, ZB; Han, JB","In order to enhance river-ocean connection and improve shipping capacity, plans have been made to build a multichamber lock and a canal to connect the sea and inland lake. The construction will alter the inland topography and the salt distribution in the lake. In the long run, it will influence the surrounding ecosystem significantly. In this research, box model of salt exchange in the lock and three-dimensional model of salt intrusion in canal are set up to predict the salt exchange in lock chambers, water saving basins and the canal. The study shows that the saltwater intrusion in chambers arrives at dynamic balance after several days' functioning of lock, and the salinity in each chamber fluctuates in certain range. However, due to the long distance of canal, saltwater intrusion in the canal is much different from that in lock, and the canal can be divided into three regions according to the intrusion pattern: In the density flow region, salt water is propelled by gravity and goes upstream rapidly. The salinity in this region fluctuates as the opening and closing of lock gate, and comes to dynamic balance at the nearly same time as that in chambers; in the transition region, the impacts of gravity is weaken while the effects of diffusion is becoming stronger, and salt water runs upstream in a moderate velocity. Salinity in this region keeps rising at the beginning of lock's operation, and meets the dynamic balance after a longer time; in the diffusion region, salt water is pushed all by diffusion action, and moves with a much small upstream rate. Salinity in this region becomes constant after a much longer time's slow rising. The study presents a view of salinity variation in locks and its long canal, which is much different form that in locks with short canal. The long cannel slows down the saltwater intrusion from lock to lake, and is helpful for alleviating the intrusion.",2015,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM,,,181-190,WOS:000398996200023,,,#18950,Yang 2015,,

In the face of this problem, a strategic plan has been developed for the Vietnamese Mekong Delta that suggests adapting to increasing salinity levels. However, the farmers' capacity to implement the changes is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess farmers' adaptive capacities towards saline intrusion in the Tra Vinh province in order to provide appropriate adaptation options, using the MOTA (Motivation-Ability) approach. This study surveyed 187 farmers regarding their perception, motivation, and ability in different saline environments in the study area, including three regions: seawater areas (region 1), brackish water areas (region 2), and freshwater areas (region 3). The results showed that farmers have quite high perceptions of salinity intrusion, especially farmers who live in areas affected by it. Regarding the level of saltwater intrusion, the farmers' motivation in all three regions had a negative score, which indicates their motivation for adapting to increased salinity was quite low. Additionally, the farmers' adaptive capacities in all three regions were moderate, with lowest capacities in educational level and rate of participation in non-agricultural organizations. The study results may be useful for managers and policy-makers in proposing appropriate and feasible options for implementing an adaptation plan to ensure sustainable livelihoods for local farmers.",2019,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,62,9,1619-1635,WOS:000475048900001,10.1080/09640568.2019.1631147,,#18963,Hoan 2019,,
1588,Ratio of Major Ions in Groundwater to Determine Saltwater Intrusion in Coastal Areas,"Sudaryanto; Naily, W","Saltwater or seawater intrusion into groundwater aquifers occurs mostly in big cities and developing coastal cities. Coastal hydrology is associated with complex and highly dynamic environmental characteristics of interactions between groundwater, surface water, and water from the estuary. The rise of sea levels and excessive use of groundwater for clean water source trigger saltwater intrusion. Identification of saltwater intrusion into groundwater can be done by groundwater sampling and major ion analysis. The major ions dissolved in water are Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, HCO3, and SO4; the major ion ratios are Cl/Br, Ca/Mg, Ca/(HCO3 and SO4), and Na.Cl. By knowing whether groundwater quality has been or has not been influenced by saltwater, groundwater zones can be determined in every coastal area. In addition, by analyzing and reviewing some concepts about the intrusion or contamination of saltwater into groundwater, there will be sufficient results for the identification of saltwater intrusion.",2018,,GLOBAL COLLOQUIUM ON GEOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING 2017,118,,,WOS:000445923300021,10.1088/1755-1315/118/1/012021,,#18978,Sudaryanto 2018,,
1591,Effect of seawater intrusion on formation of bromine-containing trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during chlorination,"Ged, EC; Boyer, TH","This study quantified the formation and speciation of halogenated organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during chlorination as a function of seawater intrusion by spiking fresh groundwater with 0.1% to 2% seawater by volume. The four chlorine- and bromine-containing trihalomethanes (THM4) and the nine chlorine- and bromine-containing haloacetic acids (HAA9) were the DBPs investigated. The bromide concentration increased from 38 mu g L-1 in fresh groundwater to 974 ug L-1 in 2% seawater, and upon chlorination the concentration of THM4 increased from 43 to 206 pg L-1 and the concentration of HAA9 increased from 39 to 75 pig L-1. At 0.4% seawater and higher the THM4 concentration exceeded the U.S. EPA maximum contaminant level of 80 pg L-1. Although the mass concentration of HAA9 increased by nearly a factor of 2 over the seawater range of 0% to 2%, the mass concentration of the five regulated HAAs (i.e., HAA5) remained approximately constant. This is because HAA5 excludes four bromine-containing species. The increase in mass concentrations of THM4 and HAA9 with increasing seawater intrusion was the result of an increased molar formation of DBP species and a shift from chlorinated species to brominated species.

1592,Investigating Effect of Pumping Ratio on Effectiveness of Barrier Wells for Saltwater Intrusion: Lab-Scale Experiments and Numerical Modeling,"Ozaki, S; Akl, CA; Nagino, T; Hiroshiro, Y","Saltwater intrusion, leading to the salinization of fresh groundwater, is the most challenging problem in coastal regions. Saltwater pumping from a barrier well is widely applied to prevent saltwater intrusion. Owing to its easy installation, many studies have investigated saltwater pumping. However, quantitative relationships between the barrier and inland production wells have not been revealed. In this study, lab-scale experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of a barrier well on the possible flow rate of freshwater from a production well. Moreover, a two-dimensional numerical model was created and simulated under the same conditions as those used in the experiments to analyze the experimental results. Consequently, a critical pumping ratio of 1.9 was obtained. In the numerical simulation, it was confirmed that an upconing of highly concentrated saltwater toward the barrier well was observed when the pumping ratio was less than the critical ratio. In conclusion, there is a critical pumping ratio between the barrier and the production well, and saltwater intrusion can be controlled by keeping the pumping rates under the critical ratio. Although further studies have yet to be conducted on a practical scale, this study showed the potential of the pumping ratio control to manage saltwater intrusion.",2021,,WATER,13,15,,WOS:000682303600001,10.3390/w13152100,,#18987,Ozaki 2021,,

Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise.",2018,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,5,,,WOS:000457321800001,10.3389/fmars.2018.00342,,#19001,Jurasinski 2018,,

In this study, we have carried out physical sand tank modeling of SLR-SWI in a flux-controlled unconfined aquifer setting to test if SWI overshoot is a measurable physical process. Photographs of the physical SLR experiments show, for the first time, that an overshoot occurs under controlled laboratory conditions. A sea-level drop (SLD) experiment was also carried out, and overshoot was again observed, whereby the interface was temporarily closer to the coast than the eventual steady state position. This shows that an overshoot can occur for the case of a retreating interface. Numerical modeling corroborated the physical SLR and SLD experiments. The magnitude of the overshoot for SLR and SLD in the physical experiments was 24% of the change in steady state interface position, albeit the laboratory setting is designed to maximize overshoot extent by adopting high groundwater flow gradients and large and rapid sea-level changes. While the likelihood of overshoot at the field scale appears to be low, this work has shown that it can be observed under controlled laboratory conditions.",2013,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,49,10,6522-6526,WOS:000327432500027,10.1002/wrcr.20526,,#19017,Morgan 2013,,

Gas fluxes [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)], rates of microbial processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis), and porewater and solid phase biogeochemistry were measured throughout the experiment. Flux rates of CO2 and, surprisingly, CH4 increased significantly following salt-water intrusion, and remained elevated relative to freshwater cores for 6 and 5 months, respectively. Following salt-water intrusion, rates of sulfate reduction increased significantly and remained higher than rates in the freshwater controls throughout the experiment. Rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were higher than rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but the rates did not differ by salinity treatment. Soil organic C content decreased significantly in soils experiencing salt-water intrusion. Estimates of total organic C mineralized in freshwater and salt-water amended soils over the 1-year experiment using gas flux measurements (18.2 and 24.9 mol C m(-2), respectively) were similar to estimates obtained from microbial rates (37.8 and 56.2 mol C m(-2), respectively), and to losses in soil organic C content (0 and 44.1 mol C m(-2), respectively).

In order to analyze the key processes that control saltwater intrusion, a hypothetical steady-state salt distribution in a representative cross-section perpendicular to the coastline was calculated using a two-dimensional density-dependent solute transport model. The effects of changes in groundwater recharge, lowering of drainage levels, and a rising sea level on the shape and position of the freshwater/saltwater interface were modeled in separate simulations. The results show that the exchange of groundwater and surface water in the marsh areas is one of the key processes influencing saltwater intrusion. A rising sea level causes rapid progression of saltwater intrusion, whereas the drainage network compensates changes in groundwater recharge. The time scale of changes resulting from altered boundary conditions is on the order of decades and centuries, suggesting that the present-day salt distribution does not reflect a steady-state of equilibrium.",2007,,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,15,2,267-279,WOS:000244821600006,10.1007/s10040-006-0151-z,,#19063,Feseker 2007,,
1610,High-resolution Sr-isotopic evolution of Black Sea water during the Holocene: Implications for reconnection with the global ocean,"Ankindinova, O; Hiscott, RN; Aksu, AE; Grimes, V","The 10 m-thick Holocene succession at core site M02-45 (41 degrees 41.17'N, 28 degrees 19.08'E, -69 m water depth) has key advantages for investigation of the Sr-isotopic evolution of the Holocene Black Sea. Earlier studies have focussed on thinner successions and coquinas. At the M02-45 site (augmented by nearby core M05-03P),Sr-87/Sr-86 determinations on mollusc shells extracted at mostly 10-20 cm depth increments provide a temporal resolution mostly < 200 years in sediment older than similar to 5500 cal yr BP, and similar to 20-25 years for the early Holocene reconnection between the Black Sea (formerly the Neoeuxine Lake) and the global ocean. Isotopic measurements are in stratigraphic order, so temporal trends are unambiguous. Measurements were made using a Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) and have 1 sigma uncertainties of similar to +/- 0.000015. There are four stages of Sr-87/(86) Sr increase and salination associated with the reconnection. From 12,145-9580 cal yr BP (stage A), before first Mediterranean inflow, the Sr-isotopic ratio varied from 0.708847-0.708881. Modelling suggests that the Sr concentration in the Neoeuxine Lake might have been several times higher than modern river values because of evaporative concentration. For similar to 100 years immediately before reconnection (9580-9490 cal yr BP, stage B),Sr-87/(86) values dropped to their lowest levels: 0.708841-0.708843. Abruptly (in geological terms),Sr-87/(86) then began to climb starting 9465-9490 cal yr BP and reached a quasi-steady-state 'plateau' with ratios similar to 0.708965 by similar to 9380 cal yr BP (stage C). The sharp Sr-87/(86) increase marks the first significant intrusion of saline water into a previously isolated Neoeuxine Lake. The quasi-steady-state condition lasted 350-400 years. Subsequently, starting similar to 8985 cal yr BP and proceeding to the present day, there was a step-wise rise of Sr-87/(86) to modern levels (stage D), during which a salinity threshold was passed that allowed widespread replacement of brackish-water faunas by Mediterranean species. Modelling suggests that the lake/sea level likely did not, and could not, rise from -120 m to - 30 m between 9490 and 9380 cal yr BP unless (a) the Sr concentration in the pre-reconnection Neoeuxine Lake was 3-4 times higher than today, or (b) the water column was strongly stratified during first entry of saline water.The second alternative is very unlikely because of seasonal vertical mixing (downwelling/upwelling) in what was then a rather homogeneous temperate lake. Catastrophic flooding of a lowstand lake would require an average discharge through the Strait of Bosphorus of similar to 9500 m(3)s(-1), whereas saline entry of Mediterranean water as an underflow into an already high lake could reproduce the first stage of Sr-87/(86) increase with an average discharge as low as similar to 2200 m(3)s(-1). Because the M02-45 site is similar to 50 m above the late Pleistocene lowstand shoreline and contains sub-wavebase sediments with Sr-87/(86) values that record the first entry of saline water into the Neoeuxine Lake, the surface of the lake must have been significantly higher than - 70 m at the time of the reconnection. Two prominent 'plateaux' which punctuate the long-term Sr-87/(86) increase are attributed to decadal to centennial periods of increased discharge from European rivers, creating a positive hydrological balance and effectively blocking or seriously impeding saline-water advance up the Strait of Bosphorus toward the Black Sea.",2019,,MARINE GEOLOGY,407,,213-228,WOS:000456222900014,10.1016/j.margeo.2018.11.004,,#19070,Ankindinova 2019,,
1611,"Sensitivity of Iberian estuaries to changes in sea water temperature, salinity, river flow, mean sea level, and tidal amplitudes","Serrano, MA; Cobos, M; Magana, PJ; Diez-Minguito, M","This study evaluated how multiyear changes in sea water temperature, salinity, river flow, sea level, and tidal amplitudes influenced the exchange mass flow, tidal energy propagation, water column stratification, and saline intrusion in 93 Iberian estuaries. To do this, trends estimated between 2000 and 2015 in four vulnerability indices that characterize these properties were evaluated. The analysis of the indices suggested that most of the estuaries reduced both exchange mass flow and tidal energy during the analysis period mainly due to the overall decreasing trends in the M2 tidal amplitude from 2000 to 2015, which are more significantly in the southwestern estuaries of the Atlantic facade. The bulk Richardson number for most of the Spanish estuaries, particularly those in Mediterranean waters, decreased due to the strong reduction of river flows in recent years. This fact, along with the increasing trends in mean sea level, produced a saline intrusion increase at all locations, being more pronounced in the Mediterranean and the South Atlantic estuaries of the Iberian Peninsula. With a view to identify the most sensitive estuaries to environmental changes, the four indices were merged into a single net sensitivity index. Overall, the most vulnerable estuaries were those located along the Mediterranean coast, especially Jucar and Segura inlets. In Atlantic waters, the Guadalquivir and Guadiana River estuaries showed the highest relative variations of the four indices. This study indicates that the reduction of river flows is the most influential factor that affects most Spanish Iberian estuaries.",2020,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,236,,,WOS:000527916100019,10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106624,,#19073,Serrano 2020,,
1612,Signs and Geological Prerequisites of Seawater Intrusion into Coastal Aquifers (the Example of the Black Sea),"Mironyuk, SG; Khlebnikova, OA","Signs of seawater intrusion into aquifers on the Black Sea coast have been considered. A review of publications showed that this dangerous hydrogeological process develops under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors, being almost global due to the rising sea level and growing urbanization of coastal areas. Local geomorphological, geological, and hydrological factors that have a decisive influence on the development of the intrusion have been indicated. The analysis of publications allowed us to outline the most vulnerable seashore areas as regards the development of the intrusion. The hazardous consequences of seawater intrusion into land aquifers (intensification of corrosion, deterioration of groundwater quality, degradation of coastal ecosystems, etc.) have been described. The data illustrating the signs and scale of seawater intrusion into certain coastal areas of the Black Sea coast have been presented. The main methods to study the hydrogeological situation at the survey sites were drillings, analysis of the hydrogeological section, laboratory studies of groundwater composition, shallow electrical survey methods (vertical electrical sounding, electro-tomography, symmetrical electro-profiling), etc. The main feature indicating the intrusion of seawater into the coastal aquifers was taken to be the salinity level of groundwater and water first from the surface of the pressure aquifers. The greatest extent of seawater intrusion was recorded in the areas composed in the upper part of the geological section by dispersed highly permeable sand, gravel and pebble deposits, or highly fractured rocks.",2022,,DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES,507,SUPPL 1,S163-S172,WOS:000939936600019,10.1134/S1028334X22601572,,#19076,Mironyuk 2022,,

However, the relative effects of these two stressors may vary by species-specific functional traits. For example, deciduous species, with leaves typically emerging during low salinity periods of the year, may suffer less from water stress than evergreen species. We sampled two woody species with contrasting functional traits: the evergreen and N-2-fixing waxmyrtle (Morella cerifera), and the deciduous and non-N-2 fixing baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along a coastal river (South Carolina, USA) showing an increasing pattern of plant mortality along a salinity gradient. We first analyzed oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of plant stem water and river water to determine changes in plant source water at different sites. Then we analyzed foliar carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) along with nitrogen and phosphorus content (%N and %P) as proxies for the water and nutrient stress. Results showed that: (1) the two species had different water sources at the higher salinity sites; (2) foliar delta N-15 values of baldcypress decreased with higher salinity while retaining a constant delta C-13 value, and both of these isotope values were positively related with foliar %P, suggesting greater nutrient stress but minor water stress under high salinity; and (3) foliar delta C-13 values of waxmyrtle increased with higher salinity while retaining a constant foliar delta N-15 value, and neither of the values was significantly related to foliar nutrients, suggesting greater water stress but minor nutrient stress under high salinity. The different responses of the two species to high salinity may be related to their differences in leaf phenology and N-2-fixation. Our results suggest that nutrient stress, particularly of P, can contribute to stress and eventual high mortality of baldcypress exposed to salt water intrusion.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,155,,378-386,WOS:000446289500036,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.07.023,,#19080,Zhai 2018,,
1614,Hydrogeology and management of freshwater lenses on atoll islands: Review of current knowledge and research needs,"Werner, AD; Sharp, HK; Galvis, SC; Post, VEA; Sinclair, P","On atoll islands, fresh groundwater occurs as a buoyant lens-shaped body surrounded by saltwater derived from the sea, forming the main freshwater source for many island communities. A review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals framework before the year 2030. In this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. Over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. We find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. Methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three-dimensional density-dependent models. Generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. Major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea-level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. We find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs.

1620,"Sea-level rise and coastal groundwater inundation and shoaling at select sites in California, USA","Hoover, DJ; Odigie, KO; Swarzenski, PW; Barnard, P","Study region: The study region spans coastal California, USA, and focuses on three primary sites: Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon.Study focus: 1m and 2m sea-level rise (SLR) projections were used to assess vulnerability to SLR-driven groundwater emergence and shoaling at select low-lying, coastal sites in California. Separate and combined inundation scenarios for SLR and groundwater emergence were developed using digital elevation models of study site topography and groundwater surfaces constructed from well data or published groundwater level contours.New hydrological insights for the region: SLR impacts are a serious concern in coastal California which has a long (1800 km) and populous coastline. Information on the possible importance of SLR-driven groundwater inundation in California is limited. In this study, the potential for SLR-driven groundwater inundation at three sites (Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon) was investigated under 1 m and 2 m SLR scenarios. These sites provide insight into the vulnerability of Northern California coastal plains, coastal developments built on beach sand or sand spits, and developed areas around coastal lagoons associated with seasonal streams and berms. Northern California coastal plains with abundant shallow groundwater likely will see significant and widespread groundwater emergence, while impacts along the much drier central and southern California coast may be less severe due to the absence of shallow groundwater in many areas. Vulnerability analysis is hampered by the lack of data on shallow coastal aquifers, which commonly are not studied because they are not suitable for domestic or agricultural use. Shallow saline aquifers may be present in many areas along coastal California, which would dramatically increase vulnerability to SLR -driven groundwater emergence and shoaling. Improved understanding of the extent and response of California coastal aquifers to SLR will help in preparing for mitigation and adaptation.

At present, the complex faces threats by effluents from the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) system and from saline seawater intrusion during high tides. These threats have destroyed the ecosystem of the lakes Cholari, Mehro, Pateji and Sanhro belonging to the complex. The total present lake area, maintained at the Cholari weir crest level, is about 170km(2). The lakes are expanding, available data shows that there is an increase up to 700% in the original lakes' area, from 6058 to 41220 acres from 1954 to 1977. This is mainly caused by the operation of Kotri Barrage surface drainage system and has positive impact on lakes' ecology because the drainage effluent is of marginal salinity. The rapid increase in the lakes' area, of about 40% within 2 years after the functioning of the Tidal Link with saline effluents from LBOD and sea intruded water have changed the ecology of the area. This posed significant impact on the ecosystem. Conversely, a similar rise in water level due to sea intrusion has nearly doubled the surface area and reposed a negative impact on the system. These lakes were giving shelter to a wide variety of local and migratory birds and had aquatic biodiversity. Hence, parts of Sanhro and Mehro dhands have been recognized by the RAMSAR Convention.",2019,,ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH,9,3,4148-4153,WOS:000470729700015,,,#19104,Mahessar 2019,,
1625,Empirical relationships of groundwater head-salinity response to variations of sea level and vertical recharge in coastal confined karst aquifers,"Canul-Macario, C; Salles, P; Hernandez-Espriu, A; Pacheco-Castro, R","Coastal aquifers are characterized by a mixing zone with freshwater-saltwater interactions, which have a strong relationship with hydrological forcings such as astronomical and storm tides, aquifer recharge and pumping effects. These forcings govern the aquifer hydraulic head, the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity and the saline interface position. This work is an empirical evaluation through time-series analysis between aquifer head and groundwater salinity associated with the sea-level dynamics and the aquifer recharge. Groundwater pressure, temperature and salinity were measured in a confined aquifer in the northwest coast of Yucatan (Mexico) during May 2017-May 2018, along with precipitation. Cross-correlation and linear Pearson correlation (r) analyses were performed with the data time series, separating astronomical and meteorological tides and vertical recharge effects. The results show that the astronomical and meteorological tides are directly correlated with the aquifer head response (0.71 r < 0.99). Salinity has a direct and strong relationship with the astronomical tide (0.76 r < 0.98), while the meteorological tide does not (r < 0.5). The vertical recharge showed a moderate correlation with the aquifer head (0.5 r < 0.7) and a nonsignificant correlation with the groundwater salinity (r < 0.5). In this study, the sea level (r > 0.7) is a more important forcing than the vertical recharge (with 0.5 r < 0.7). Empirical relationships through time-series analysis and the separation of individual hydrological forcings in the analysis are powerful tools to study, define and validate the conceptual model of the aquifer.",2020,,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,28,5,1679-1694,WOS:000528424500001,10.1007/s10040-020-02151-9,,#19116,Canul-Macario 2020,,
1626,Available carbon and nitrate increase greenhouse gas emissions from soils affected by salinity,"Dang, DM; Macdonald, B; Warneke, S; White, I","Sea-level rise and saline water intrusion have caused a shortage of fresh water and affected agricultural areas globally. Besides inundation, the salinity could alter soil nitrogen and carbon cycling in coastal soils. To examine the effect of salinity, an incubation experiment was used to investigate soil nitrogen and carbon cycling from an acid sulfate soil and an alluvial soil with and without additional nitrogen and carbon sources. Four levels of saline solution of 0.03, 10, 16 and 21 dS m(-1) were used to submerge acid sulfate and alluvial soil samples in a 125-mL jar. The experimental jars were incubated in the dark at 25 degrees C. Gas samples were collected over 4 weeks and analysed for nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The results showed that salinity significantly decreased N2O emissions from the acid sulfate soil but did not affect emissions from the alluvial soil. Addition of glucose and nitrate enhanced N2O production in both salt-affected soils. Emissions of CO2 were not different among the salinity treatments, whereas available carbon and nitrate promoted soil respiration. Changes in CH4 fluxes over the 4-week incubation were the same for both soils, and substrate addition did not affect emissions in either soil. The findings indicate that salinity has altered carbon and nitrogen cycles in the acid sulfate soil, and future fertiliser and crop management will need to account for the changed nutrient cycling caused by saline water intrusion and climate change.",2017,,SOIL RESEARCH,55,1,47-57,WOS:000392202900006,10.1071/SR16010,,#19121,Dang 2017,,
1628,Saltwater Intrusion-Induced Flow Reversal in the Changjiang Estuary,"Ge, JZ; Lu, JY; Zhang, JS; Chen, CS; Liu, AQ; Ding, PX","Saltwater intrusion is a common feature in the Changjiang Estuary affected by river discharges and tidal flows. It leads to a two-layer flow structure during the flood-to-ebb tidal transient period: the seaward tidal flow in the upper water column and onshore intruded salt flow in the lower column, even though the lower column water usually experiences an ebb flow eventually. Our recent measurements with a tripod deployed in a tidal channel of the North Branch in the East China Sea challenged this feature. We detected that the two-layer flow structure disappeared in the ebb tide period during the neap cycle due to intense saltwater intrusion. A constant onshore flood-like flow predominated the entire water column. The physical mechanism for the flow reversal was examined using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). The FVCOM was robust to capture the observed flow reversal in the tidal channel during the neap tidal cycle. The momentum balance analysis results suggest that the flow reversal occurred when the saltwater intrusion-induced onshore baroclinic pressure gradient force and baroclinic tidal rectification overwhelmed the seaward barotropic pressure gradient force. A parameter-driven criterion was derived theoretically to determine the potential occurrence of a stable ebb flow reversal in the tidal channel.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,11,,WOS:000878628900001,10.1029/2021JC018270,,#19125,Ge 2022,,

1633,Tipping points for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers under rising sea level,"Mazi, K; Koussis, AD; Destouni, G","This study considers different projections of climate-driven sea-level rise and uses a recently developed, generalized analytical model to investigate the responses of sea intrusion in unconfined sloping coastal aquifers to climate-driven sea-level rise. The results show high nonlinearity in these responses, implying important thresholds, or tipping points, beyond which the responses of seawater intrusion to sea-level rise shift abruptly from a stable state of mild change responses to a new stable state of large responses to small changes that can rapidly lead to full seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer. The identified tipping points are of three types: (a) spatial, for the particular aquifers (sections) along a coastline with depths that imply critical risk of full sea intrusion in response to even small sea-level rise; (b) temporal, for the critical sea-level rise and its timing, beyond which the change responses and the risk of complete sea intrusion in an aquifer shift abruptly from low to very high; and (c) managerial, for the critical minimum values of groundwater discharge and hydraulic head that inland water management must maintain in an aquifer in order to avoid rapid loss of control and complete sea intrusion in response to even small sea-level rise. The existence of a tipping point depends on highly variable aquifer properties and groundwater conditions, in combination with more homogeneous sea conditions.

The reservoir significantly narrowed the upper reaches of the North Channel and deepened the channel near the reservoir. These topographical changes inevitably influenced hydrodynamic processes and saltwater intrusion in the estuary. A well-validated model was employed to investigate the influence of the QCSR on saltwater intrusion in the Changjiang Estuary. The model results showed that the narrowed upper reaches of the North Channel decreased the water diversion ratio and thus increased salinity in the North Channel. During the moderate tide after neap tide, the salinity decreased at the water intake of the QCSR because saltwater intrusion was obstructed at flood slack at the surface, while the salinity increase during the moderate tide after spring tide was mainly due to the intensified saltwater intrusion during spring tide. The deepening of the channel near the QCSR resulted in an increased water diversion ratio, and the salinity in the Eastern Chongming Shoal decreased by more than 0.5 psu during spring tide; however, the saltwater intrusion was enhanced due to the strengthened baroclinic force, which is proportional to the water depth. During neap tide, the salinity in the entire North Channel decreased because of a 1.4% increase in the water diversion ratio of the North Channel and the relatively weak tide.",2021,,ANTHROPOCENE COASTS,4,1,17-35,WOS:000625879700001,10.1139/anc-2020-0015,,#19168,Ding 2021,,

The usage of high salinity level of water as drinking water can lead to a very serious health hazard towards human. Saline water intrusion is a process by which induced flow of seawater into freshwater aquifer along the coastal area. It might happen due to human action and/or by natural event. The climate change and rise up of sea level may speed up the saline water intrusion process. The conventional method for distinguishing and checking saltwater interference to groundwater along the coast aquifers is to gather and test the groundwater from series of observation wells (borehole) with an end goal to give the important information about the hydrochemistry data to conclude whether the water in the well are safe to consume or not. An integrated approach of field and laboratory electrical resistivity investigation is proposed for indicating the contact region between saline and fresh groundwater. It was found that correlation for both soilbox produced almost identical curvilinear trends for 2% increment of seawater tested using sand sample.

1641,Numerical study of groundwater flow cycling controlled by seawater/freshwater interaction in Woodville Karst Plain,"Xu, ZY; Hu, BX; Xu, ZX; Wu, XJ","Seawater intrusion due to sea level rise and climate change could significantly contaminate coastal groundwater resources, particularly in Florida, the flat low-land state in the United States. Based on the field investigation and hydrological measurements, a three-dimensional SEAWAT model is developed to evaluate the groundwater flow cycling and seawater intrusion to freshwater system in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP), a typical karst groundwater system in the Floridan aquifer. The karst conduit network in the aquifer acts as fast flow pathway for groundwater flow and solute transport, so seawater could deeply intrude into the aquifer. Wakulla Spring, an inland spring 17 km from the coast and a coastal submarine spring, Spring Creek Spring Complex are connected through the conduit network. The flow direction between the two springs switches under various rainfall conditions in this region, thus the discharges at two karst springs are used to estimate the location of seawater/freshwater mixing interface. The SEAWAT modeling results indicate that the mixing interface, defined as 2 PSU (Practical Salinity Unit), intrudes 3 to 5 km through the subsurface karst conduit during the dry season and severely contaminates nearly 1 km width of groundwater around the conduit. The salinity distribution and the distance of seawater intrusion through the conduit system are very sensitive to precipitation variation and the sea level boundary condition. Furthermore, predictions are made for seawater intrusion to the aquifer under various sea level rise, precipitation scenarios and water pumping. The results show that the seawater intrusion could reach and contaminate inland freshwater systems if sea level rises 1.0 m or during a long-term no-precipitation season. This study provides insights for modeling and predicting the vulnerability of a coastal karst aquifer through the simulation of variable-density flow.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,579,,,WOS:000500371200031,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124171,,#19181,Xu 2019,,
1642,Farming carbon: The link between saltwater intrusion and carbon storage in coastal agricultural fields,"de la Reguera, E; Tully, KL","As sea levels continue to rise, coastal agroecosystems have become more vulnerable to saltwater intrusion (SWI). Saltwater intrusion is the landward movement of sea salts, which can alter carbon (C) storage. Transitioning agricultural fields have the potential to become C sinks as SWI advances inland and turns farms to marshes. The objectives of our study were to (1) quantify the size of C pools along a salinity transect; (2) determine how soil C is occluded through levels of physical protection in soil aggregates; (3) examine relationships between indicators of SWI and soil C measures in coastal farm fields. We collected soils (to a depth of similar to 140 cm) along a transect from the edge of a salt-damaged field (high salinity and frequently inundated) to the center (low salinity and drier). We measured bulk soil C pools and the amount of C stored in large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt+clay size classes. Soil C pools were largest in the edge of field and ditch bank soils compared to the center of the field (P = 0.01). In ditch bank soils, most of the C was stored in large macroaggregates; however, in the center of the field, most C was stored in silt+clays. We suggest that frequent wetting events may lead to increased C storage along the edges of farm fields both as a result of suppressed decomposition rates and increased clay flocculation leading to macroaggregate formation. Further, a vegetation shift from annual, shallow-rooted crops to perennial, deeply rooted marsh grasses along field edges likely contributed to higher soil C levels as well as increased aggregation. An improved understanding of soil C dynamics can help inform management strategies that support farm and environmental wellbeing as our coastlines change.",2021,,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,314,,,WOS:000647427500012,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107416,,#19184,delaReguera 2021,,

Field investigations were conducted at 500 points to measure salinity concentration longitudinally and transversally (i.e. at five cross-sections) in the Hau River during high tide and low tide conditions.Vertical and longitudinal salinity distributions along two branches of the Hau River are very complicated. At cross-section 3 which is 5km from the river mouth, the difference in salinity concentration between the surface and bottom is approximately 6g/l. The maximum salinity concentration appears at the deepest point and occurs 1 hour after the peak of the water level at the ebb tide. Moreover, the vertical velocity gradually reduces from the surface to the bottom at ebb tide but during the flood tide, vertically maximum velocity appears near the bottom, at the middle of the cross-section. Importantly, various stratification parameters, including Pritchard, Simmon and Richarson numbers show that the partial mixing and moderate stratification condition prevails in the DinhAn branch during a tidal cycle.

Pargos Spring offshore of Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico, intermittently discharges brackish water and allows intrusion of lagoon water with seawater salinity to the aquifer. Lagoon water intrusion occurred when sea level was > 0.08 m above mean observed values during the study period. Salt water intrusion will be permanent within a few decades at the current eustatic sea-level rise rate of similar to 3 mm/yr. A mixing model demonstrates that oxygen dissolved in the lagoon water is reduced as it intrudes the spring. Dissolved oxygen (DO) reduction is greater at the spring vent than at sensors similar to 10 m inside the conduit, reflecting rapid reaction kinetics. DO reduction results from organic carbon remineralization, which also releases N and P to the water.

Water level monitoring during the test revealed that at the end of pumping, the upper 2 m of the aquifer had dewatered in the vicinity of the well field, reversing hydraulic gradients between the aquifer and the sea. This induced SI, with mixing models of well head water quality suggesting that saline water contributions to total discharge rose from 4 % to 8 %. ERI results reflected dewatering through an increase in resistivity in the upper 2-6 m of the aquifer, while a decline in resistivity, relative to background conditions, occurred immediately below this, reflecting the migration of saline water through the upper layers of the aquifer to the pumping well. By contrast no change in resistivity occurred at depth, indicating no significant change in contribution from the basal saline water to discharge. Test findings suggest that future water resource development at the site should focus on close monitoring of shallow pumping, or pumping from deeper parts of the aquifer, while more generally demonstrating the value of time-lapse geophysical methods in informing coastal water resource management.",2023,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,867,,,WOS:000997523800001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161442,,#19217,McDonnell 2023,,

A fast response is observed in the Dead Sea coastal aquifer, exhibited both in the drop of the water levels and in the location of the fresh-saline water interface. No such effect is yet observed in the Mediterranean coastal aquifer, as expected. Numerical simulations, using the FeFlow software, show that the effect of global sea level rise depends on the coastal topography next to the shoreline. A slope of 2.5% is expected to yield a shift of the interface by 400 m, after a rise of 1m (similar to 100 years), whereas a vertical slope will yield no shift. Reduced recharge due to climate change or overexploitation of groundwater also enhances the inland shift of the interface.",2010,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,46,,,WOS:000285837700001,10.1029/2009WR008708,,#19218,Yechieli 2010,,

(2) Geology drives rates of erosion, weathering, ion exchange, and acidification-alkalinization. (3) Flowpaths drive salinization and contaminant mobilization along hydrologic cycles.

Influence of the content of the dissolved oxygen and salinity of water as major ecological factors for the efficiency fishery productivity was characterized. The comparative analysis of long-term dynamics sea levels surfaces in a southwest part of the Baltic sea and in strait Kattegat was made. It was shown that inflow of water mases in many respects depended on the sea level difference between these areas from the North Sea possessing the raised salinity and the higher content of the dissolved oxygen.

Constituting 30 % of all freshwater, groundwater is the main source of available freshwater. Coastal aquifers, which serve as the major freshwater source for densely populated zones, are of vital importance and quite vulnerable to climate change. This paper examines the significant consequences of climate change, decreasing recharge rates, sea-level rise and increasing freshwater demand on the sustainable management of coastal aquifers, via a hypothetical case study. A 3-D numerical model is developed using SEAWAT, to simulate a circular island aquifer in the form of a freshwater lens surrounded by saltwater. Issues such as sloping land surface resulting in landward migration of the coastal boundary and transient response of the system due to pumping are considered through a set of predictive simulations. To assess the sensitivity of the model results to important parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed. Results of this research, revealing the effects of mentioned pressures on the long-term sustainability of the freshwater resource, are evaluated on the basis of groundwater reserves and intrusion of the freshwater-saltwater interface in lateral and vertical directions. These outcomes are further used to determine the sustainable pumping rate of the system, considering both quantity and quality of the groundwater resources.",2014,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,72,6,2183-2193,WOS:000341083800036,10.1007/s12665-014-3130-z,,#19227,Unsal 2014,,
1658,"The Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Patterns of Shallow Groundwater Level and Salinity: The Yellow River Delta, China","Fan, XM; Min, T; Dai, XJ","Shallow groundwater in coastal aquifers is a highly dynamic and complex system with a high risk of seawater intrusion. Analyzing the spatio-temporal dynamic patterns of groundwater can help to manage the groundwater resource and prevent it from degradation. Based on the groundwater level (GWL) and electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring data of 18 observation wells in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) from 2004 to 2010, this research analyses the groundwater dynamics using a robust seasonal trend decomposition technique (STL) and spatial interpolation method to detect the groundwater spatio-temporal dynamic patterns of groundwater level and salinity. Combined with hydro-climatic data, the Pearson correlation method and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend analysis were used to further reveal the impacts that induce their trends and seasonal variations. Our analyses show that the risk of seawater intrusion into local shallow aquifers in this region is high, with the mean groundwater level over 42% of the region lower than the local sea level, and the mean groundwater EC over 96% of the region met the standards for seawater intrusion. In addition, the trends of groundwater level generally declined by 0.01 similar to 0.45 m/a and salinity increased by 1.153 similar to 25.608 mu s/cm.a, which are consistent with the trend of precipitation decline. The seasonal dynamics of groundwater level and salinity are highly correlated with the seasonal components of rainfall and evaporation. It can be concluded that the extent of seawater intrusion will increase in the future with sea level rise. The approaches used in this study proved to be effective and can certainly serve as an example for the analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of groundwater in other coastal regions.",2023,,WATER,15,7,,WOS:000970375400001,10.3390/w15071426,,#19229,Fan 2023,,
1659,Differential Responses of Soil Extracellular Enzyme Activities to Salinization: Implications for Soil Carbon Cycling in Tidal Wetlands,"Yang, Y; Moorhead, DL; Craig, H; Luo, M; Chen, X; Huang, JF; Olesen, JE; Chen, J","Rising sea levels are expected to cause salinization in many historically low-salinity tidal wetlands. However, the response of soil extracellular enzyme activities to salinization in tidal wetlands and their links to soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis to examine the effect of salinization on hydrolytic and oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities and their relationships with SOC storage in tidal wetlands. The results showed that salinization reduced hydrolytic carbon-acquiring enzyme activities by 33% but increased oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities by 15%. Meanwhile, salinization decreased SOC storage by 14%, and the change in SOC storage was negatively associated with oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities. These results indicate an important role for oxidative carbon-acquiring enzymes in SOC loss in tidal wetlands. Moreover, the effect of salinization on oxidative carbon-acquiring enzyme activities logarithmically declined with increasing salinization, implying that SOC loss was highly sensitive to even minor increases in salinity at the initial stage of salinization. Given increasing salinization over time with rising sea levels in most global tidal wetlands, our results suggest that SOC loss might be greater during early than later stages. Consequently, salinization-induced SOC loss may be overstated in the long term if extrapolations are merely based on a constant SOC loss rate determined from short-term studies. Future modeling frameworks should account for this changing sensitivity of microbially mediated SOC loss with increasing salinization over time.",2022,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,36,6,,WOS:000812036600001,10.1029/2021GB007285,,#19230,Yang 2022,,
1661,Geomorphic portrait of the Little Rann of Kutch,"Gupta, V; Ansari, AA","Little Rann of Kutch is an integral part of the Rann of Kutch, occupying southeastern part of it. It remains a saline-inundated regime, partially seasonal and partially around the year. The study area experiences a very high ambient temperature at one point of time while it gets flooded by both the tidal water ingression and freshwater poured by the seasonal rivers during the monsoon season. And as a result, the area experiences a seasonal reversal of geomorphic processes which in turn is reflected through its distinctive and dynamic landforms. Geologically, this area was a part of oceanic floor and has immerged in the recent past. Geomorphology of the area plays a dominant role in the pattern and cause of saline water intrusion. The surface of Rann is at or slightly above sea level and possesses a monotonously plain character with some outcrop in the form of sandstone capped by basalts, resembling to island in the mid of the Rann. During 3 months of the southwest monsoon, storm tides, aided by the wind, force water from the Arabian Sea over the flat surface of the Ranns. Rainfall is fairly low, so that as the water recede and evaporate, they leave behind a crust of halite and gypsum crystals which grow in the clay and sands. This monotonously saline flat surface with annual inundation, have executed the Rann a mysterious piece of terrain. The characteristics and role of sediments in terms of erosional and depositional characteristics, their plasticity, facilitating capillary rise, their hygroscopic absorption capacity, infiltration capacity, permeability, etc. gives both short- and long-term implication to the area.

We surveyed diatom assemblages along transects capturing PW conductivity and TP gradients and searched for spatial boundaries in diatom assemblages along each transect. We also determined diatom assemblage thresholds to PW conductivity and TP, and identified significant indicator taxa with either negative (declining) or positive (increasing) relationships to each driver and their individual thresholds. We demonstrate that the southern Everglades exhibits spatially-structured gradients of conductivity and P that are oriented in two dimensions (i.e., with distance from the coast and from west to east) and are often, but not always, positively correlated. Our results show that these gradients drive spatial patterns of compositional similarity among our sampling sites. We found the location of greatest dissimilarity in diatom assemblages for each transect coincided with the upper boundary of the ""white zone""-the visible ecotone between freshwater and coastal marshes. We did not detect seasonal differences in the position of the diatom-inferred ecotone as expected, nor did we detect significant differences in PW conductivity or TP between wet and dry seasons. Diatom assemblages Were highly sensitive to both PW conductivity, with freshwater indicator assemblages declining above 2 mS cm(-1) and becoming replaced by a brackish water assemblage at around 20 mS cm(-1), and periphyton TP, with thresholds at 82 and 285 pg g(-1) for negatively-and positively responding taxa, respectively. Our study highlights that small increases in PW conductivity and TP are sufficient to cause shifts in the diatom assemblages of the Everglades. As saltwater continues to encroach into this area, compositional changes in this important primary producer assemblage are expected to cascade through the ecosystem and influence the food web. The diatom indicator taxa and assemblage thresholds presented here offer a sensitive tool that should continue to be developed and applied to management strategies for saltwater intrusion while its effects can still be mitigated.",2018,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,88,,190-204,WOS:000430760800021,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.003,,#19240,Mazzei 2018,,

Polder areas are extremely vulnerable to saltwater intrusion and subsequent soil salinization driven by rising sea levels and accelerated by climate change. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the recharge and discharge pattern in the Vidrice polder, a drainage canal network within the Neretva River Delta agroecosystem used to collect the surface and subsurface runoff from the agricultural land and saltwater infiltration through the aquifer. Water regime data are collected over an 18-month period of real-time monitoring at 15 min intervals on three stations along the primary drainage canal and one station at the secondary canal. Analysis of water level flashiness in the Vidrice polder using the Richards-Baker flashiness index (R-B-index) indicates that daily pumping of water infiltrated in the canal network is sub-optimal: discharge fluctuates significantly more than recharge, by 46% on average, resulting in unnecessary lowering of the water level in the drainage network. The results show that the correlation between the intensive rainfall events (>10 mm/day) and the recharge rates can be used to modify the daily pumping operation and maintain high freshwater levels in the canal network to increase the resistance to infiltration and reduce saltwater intrusion into the polder.",2023,,HYDROLOGY,10,3,,WOS:000958066500001,10.3390/hydrology10030060,,#19275,Gilja 2023,,

Moreover, Lake Urmia has become supersaturated with total salinity averaging more than 350 g/l. Salt precipitation and dissolved materials brought by inflowing rivers have formed a layer of sediment with low hydraulic conductivity on the lakebed. Considering the flat bathymetry of Lake Urmia, we conducted a series of numerical simulation scenarios to study the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the hypersaline Lake Urmia using COMSOL Mulliphysics (R). In the first step, we performed the simulations in steady-state conditions. Secondly, we simulated the lake level fall in 10 years at a rate of - 35 cm/year followed by a lake level rise at a rate of 35 cm/year for another 10 years. The steady-state results demonstrate that decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity layer and increasing its thickness lead to a less intense saltwater intrusion, with lower saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer. As the lake level begins to fall, in cases with high sediment hydraulic conductivity, incoming saltwater from the lake decreases and reaches nearly zero values through the time; instead, the lake begins to get recharged. On the other hand, as the lake level begins to rise after the falling period, the saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer increases and finally reaches a value of nearly two times greater than steady-state results. In low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases, incoming saltwater from the lake to the aquifer remains negligible through both rising and falling scenarios.",2020,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,588,,,WOS:000568826300069,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125110,,#19283,Sheibani 2020,,
1677,Assessment of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion in sloping confined coastal aquifers,"Shi, WL; Lu, CH; Werner, AD","Previous studies of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion (SLR-SWI) are mostly based on horizontal coastal aquifers, despite that most coastal aquifers are sloping. A recent study has shown that the effect of aquifer slope can not be neglected when assessing SLR-SWI in unconfined coastal aquifers. However, the effect of slope in confined aquifers has not been evaluated. In this study, we apply existing analytical solutions to quantify the effect of the slope of both upper and lower confining layers on SLR-SWI. The results show that for flux-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, SLR does not change the steady-state interface location, consistent with previous findings for horizontal aquifers. Therefore, our analysis focuses on head-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, for which we find the assumption of horizontal confining units causes significant errors. We demonstrate this by assessing the sensitivities of the seawater toe location and seawater volume to SLR for various combinations of sloping confining layers. The results indicate that the influence of the slope on SLR-SWI is small in thin confined aquifers. However, the slope is an important factor in thick confined aquifers. The influence of the slope in the lower confining layer on SLR-SWI is much greater than that of the upper confining layer. Aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to SLR-SWI, whereas those that thin towards inland are least susceptible. The assessment of SLR-SWI in sloping confined coastal aquifers in the current study demonstrates application of a rapid, first-order assessment tool that can be applied to a wide range of other sloping coastal confined-aquifer problems.",2020,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,586,,,WOS:000544258100034,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124872,,#19285,Shi 2020,,

The model MIKE21 was used to examine the hydrodynamic regime and degree of seawater intrusion in the Shatt Al-Arab estuary under three scenarios. The model was calibrated using field measurements of vertical salinity distribution and flow that were obtained in 2013, 2014 and 2016 from a boat at six stations along the main channel. These parameters were utilised to simulate the relationship between freshwater discharge and saltwater intrusion. Results show that river flows and tidal energy are the two main factors that influence the Shatt Al-Arab estuary in terms of stratification extent and circulation pattern. Tidal range fluctuations, particularly the semidiurnal tide, are another influencing factor on the saltwater spatial patterns along the Shatt Al-Arab channel. Nowadays, seawater intrusion extends 86 km upstream from the channel mouth. Within two decades, hydrodynamic behaviour is predicted to increase salinity for more than 100 km upstream from Faw city. The modelling clarified the minimum freshwater discharge required at the Abu Flus channel measurement station to maintain an acceptable salinity level along the channel. Understanding the relationship between freshwater discharge and salinity allows informed decisions to be made regarding water usage and flows in the region for sustainable water governance that limits environmental degradation.

The flooding effects on soil were quantified by measuring soil redox potential. Soil redox potential remained in the range of +400 to +450 mV in control pots while it was reduced to -50 to -140 mV in flooded pots. Stomatal conductance (g) and net carbon assimilation (A) were reduced significantly under flooding alone and flood/salt combination treatments. Stomatal conductance averaged 120 mmol H2O m-2 s-1 for control plants, while it averaged 51 and 45 mmol H2O m-2 s-1 for flooded (F) and flooded plus salt (FS) treatments, respectively. Net carbon assimilation was reduced from 5.82-mu-mol CO2 m-2 s-1 (control plants) to 2.22 and 0.09-mu-mol CO2 m-2s-1 in F and FS plants, respectively. The reductions in g and A were statistically significant. Dry weight increment per plant was reduced from 24.38 g in control to 10.09 and 8.22 g per plant in F and FS treatments, respectively. The reduction represents 59% reduction in F and 66% reduction in FS treatment. Based on the present results, it is concluded that : 1), P taeda showed considerable sensitivity to saltwater treatment within the range of soil anaerobiosis and salinity tested; and 2), in areas where saltwater intrusion occurs frequently, regeneration and survival of this species will, be adversely affected.

In many projects, information about morphology and intertidal area is needed to assess the effects of human interventions and rising sea-level on the natural depth distribution and on changing habitats. Habitat area depends on the spatial pattern of intertidal area, inundation time, peak flow velocities and salinity. While numerical models can reproduce these spatial patterns fairly well, their data need and computational costs are high and for each case a new model must be developed. Here, we present a Python tool that includes a comprehensive set of relations that predicts the hydrodynamics, bed elevation and the patterns of channels and bars in mere seconds. Predictions are based on a combination of empirical relations derived from natural estuaries, including a novel predictor for cross-sectional depth distributions, which is dependent on the along-channel width profile. Flow velocity, an important habitat characteristic, is calculated with a new correlation between depth below high water level and peak tidal flow velocity, which was based on spatial numerical modelling. Salinity is calculated from estuarine geometry and flow conditions. The tool only requires an along-channel width profile and tidal amplitude, making it useful for quick assessments, for example of potential habitat in ecology, when only remotely-sensed imagery is available.",2018,,REMOTE SENSING,10,12,,WOS:000455637600057,10.3390/rs10121915,,#19304,Leuven 2018,,

1686,Coastal groundwater model calibration using filtered and amplified hydraulic information retained in the freshwater-saltwater interface,"Pavlovskii, I; Cantelon, JA; Kurylyk, BL","Coastal groundwater flow is driven by an interplay between terrestrial and marine forcings. One of the distinguishing features in these settings is the formation of a freshwater lens due to the density difference between fresh and saline groundwater. The present study uses data collected on Sable Island, Canada-a remote sand island in the northwest Atlantic Ocean-to highlight the potential of exploiting freshwater lens geometry for calibration of numerical groundwater flow models in coastal settings. Three numerical three-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow models were constructed for different segments of the island, with only one model calibrated using the freshwater-saltwater interface derived from an electromagnetic geophysical survey. The other two (uncalibrated) models with the same parameterisation as the calibrated model successfully reproduced the interpreted interface depth and location of freshwater ponds at different parts of the island. The successful numerical model calibration, based solely on the geophysically derived interface depth, is enabled by the interface acting as an amplified version of the water table, which reduces the relative impact of the interpreted depth uncertainty. Furthermore, the freshwater-saltwater interface is far more inertial than the water table, making it less sensitive to short-term forcings. Such ""noise-filtering"" behaviour enables the use of the freshwater-saltwater interface for calibration even in dynamic settings where selection of representative groundwater heads is challenging. The completed models provide insights into island freshwater lens behaviour and highlight the role of periodic beach inundation and wave overheight in driving short-term water-table variability, despite their limited impact on the interface depth.",2022,,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,30,5,1551-1567,WOS:000828949500001,10.1007/s10040-022-02510-8,,#19308,Pavlovskii 2022,,

This paper presents a framework to model the resilience of coastal-building foundations in the presence of soil strength deterioration due to water intrusion. The resilience model is mathematically based on the integration of the time-variant performance function within a reference period of interest. A strip foundation is considered, whose ultimate bearing capacity is modeled by the Terzaghi trinomial formula. The rise of groundwater table reduces the strength of soils, and the impact of climate change on groundwater level rise is incorporated in the resilience assessment. An example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. It is shown that ignoring the effect of groundwater level rise in a changing climate would result in a non-conservative estimate of structural resilience. The life-time resilience is also dependent on the selection of the maintenance strategies, through which the performance function is restored to an enhanced state. Future studies should also consider the joint impact of other factors (e.g., corrosion) on the deterioration of coastal-building foundations.",2023,,ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS,44,1,67-74,WOS:000934795900005,10.16285/j.rsm.2022.00241,,#19309,Wang 2023,,

When the barrage was closed, the northern region of the TB transformed from an ebb-dominant system into a flood-dominant system. During high discharge periods, the barrage was opened and salinity intrusion was exponentially dependent on river discharge. During the dry period, the reduction in river flow compounded with closure of the barrage resulted in an increased salinity concentration downstream. Whereas oceanic salinity was observed at the ocean-end station, about 13PSU occurred at the river-end station when the barrage was closed.

1689,Modeling the Dynamic Response of River Deltas to Sea-Level Rise Acceleration,"Hariharan, J; Passalacqua, P; Xu, ZY; Michael, HA; Steel, E; Chadwick, A; Paola, C; Moodie, AJ","Climate change is raising sea levels across the globe. On river deltas, sea-level rise (SLR) may result in land loss, saline intrusion into groundwater aquifers, and other problems that adversely impact coastal communities. There is significant uncertainty surrounding future SLR trajectories and magnitudes, even over decadal timescales. Given this uncertainty, numerical modeling is needed to explore how different SLR projections may impact river delta evolution. In this work, we apply the pyDeltaRCM numerical model to simulate 350 years of deltaic evolution under three different SLR trajectories: steady rise, an abrupt change in SLR rate, and a gradual acceleration of SLR. For each SLR trajectory, we test a set of six final SLR magnitudes between 5 and 40 mm/yr, in addition to control runs with no SLR. We find that both surface channel dynamics as well as aspects of the subsurface change in response to higher rates of SLR, even over centennial timescales. In particular, increased channel mobility due to SLR corresponds to higher sand connectivity in the subsurface. Both the trajectory and magnitude of SLR change influence the evolution of the delta surface, which in turn modifies the structure of the subsurface. We identify correlations between surface and subsurface properties, and find that inferences of subsurface structure from the current surface configuration should be limited to time spans over which the sea level forcing is approximately steady. As a result, this work improves our ability to predict future delta evolution and subsurface connectivity as sea levels continue to rise.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,127,9,,WOS:000855584700001,10.1029/2022JF006762,,#19320,Hariharan 2022,,
1693,"Impacts of regional climate model projected rainfall, sea level rise, and urbanization on a coastal aquifer","Sathish, S; Chanu, S; Sadath, R; Elango, L","The objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate change induced rainfall, sea level rise, and urbanization on a fragile coastal aquifer. This study was carried out in one such an aquifer located in Southeast India. Downscaled climate projection was carried out using the regional climate model (RCM) with seven ensembles and the best matching ensemble for the study area has been taken to quantify the rainfall in future. The changes in land use and land cover were estimated using remote sensing techniques, and background information on sea level rise at local and regional scale were investigated. Numerical simulation of groundwater in this isolated coastal aquifer was carried out to understand the responses of the groundwater level to downscaled projected rainfall, sea level rise, expected urbanization, and their combinations until the year 2050. The RCM-projected rainfall shows a decline in the groundwater level and shrinking of the freshwater lens. However, the prediction for change in the groundwater level combined with sea level rise minimizing a decline in the groundwater level. The rapid changes in land use and land cover pattern as inferred by change detection were extended and examined in the aquifer's future characteristics by increasing and decreasing groundwater pumping with RCM-projected rainfall recharge and with sea level rise. The results without considering sea level rise show that the aquifer undergoes degradation even if pumping is reduced by 10%. The simulation with sea level rise shows that the aquifer behaves better in maintaining freshwater lens even with 10% increase in groundwater pumping. Sea level rise prevents the availability of the freshwater lens by reducing groundwater decline caused by the reduced RCM-projected rainfall and predicted groundwater demand. Huge variation and seasonal fluctuation in the volume of outflow to the sea is noticed between north and south. Also, reduced outflow against a range of sea level rise confirms that the sea level rise in the study area will lessen the volume of outflow, will reduce the groundwater decline, and will allow an increase in groundwater level. On the other hand, the shrinking of area will decrease the freshwater volume and occurrence of reduced groundwater gradient against sea level rise will increase the possibility of seawater intrusion to pumping. The present study confirms that even with RCM-projected decrease in rainfall recharge, the increase in the sea level will help to prevent groundwater decline in this aquifer by controlling an elevation of the groundwater level. Meanwhile, it is reducing the volume of freshwater and increasing the possibility of further seawater intrusion. Hence, it is recommended to reduce the groundwater pumping from this aquifer.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,29,22,33305-33322,WOS:000742328900006,10.1007/s11356-021-18213-8,,#19329,Sathish 2022,,
1697,"Freshwater-saltwater transition zone movement during aquifer storage and recovery cycles in Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, USA","Misut, PE; Voss, CI","Freshwater storage in deep aquifers of Brooklyn and Queens, New York, USA, is under consideration as an emergency water supply for New York City. The purpose of a New York City storage and recovery system is to provide an emergency water supply during times of drought or other contingencies and would entail longer-term storage phases than a typical annual cycle. There is concern amongst neighboring coastal communities that such a system would adversely impact their local water supplies via increased saltwater intrusion. This analysis uses three-dimensional modeling of variable-density ground-water flow and salt transport to study conditions under which hypothetical aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) may not adversely impact the coastal water supplies. A range of storage, pause, and recovery phase lengths and ASR cycle repetitions were used to test scenarios that emphasize control of potential saltwater intrusion.The USGS SUTRA code was used to simulate movement of the freshwater-saltwater transition zones in a detailed model of the upper glacial, Jameco, Magothy, and Lloyd aquifers of western Long Island, New York. Simulated transition zones in the upper glacial, Jameco, and Magothy aquifers reach a steady state for 1999 stress and recharge conditions within 1 ka; however, saltwater encroachment is ongoing in the Lloyd (deepest) aquifer, for which the effects of the rise in sea level since deglaciation on transition zone equilibration are retarded by many ka due to the thick, overlying Raritan confining unit. Pumping in the 20th century has also caused widening and landward movement of the Lloyd aquifer transition zone. Simulation of scenarios of freshwater storage by injection followed by phases of pause and recovery by extraction indicates that the effect of net storage when less water is recovered than injected is to set up a hydraulic saltwater intrusion barrier in the Lloyd aquifer which may have beneficial effects to coastal water users.

1698,Numerical simulation on the process of saltwater intrusion and its impact on the suspended sediment concentration in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary,"Pang, CG; Zhao, EB; Yang, Y","To study the relationship between sediment transportation and saltwater intrusion in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary, a three-dimensional numerical model for temperature, salinity, velocity field, and suspended sediment concentration was established based on the ECOMSED model. Using this model, sediment transportation in the flood season of 2005 was simulated for the Changjiang estuary. A comparison between simulated results and observation data for the tidal level, flow velocity and direction, salinity and suspended sediment concentration indicated that they were consistent in overall. Based on model verification, the simulation of saltwater intrusion and its effect on sediment in the Changjiang estuary was analyzed in detail. The saltwater intrusion in the estuary including the formation, evolution, and disappearance of saltwater wedge and the induced vertical circulation were reproduced, and the crucial impact of the wedge on cohesive and non-cohesive suspended sediment distribution and transportation were successfully simulated. The result shows that near the salinity front, the simulated concentrations of both cohesive and non-cohesive suspended sediment at the surface layer had a strong relationship with the simulated velocity, especially when considering a 1-hour lag. However, in the bottom layer, there was no obvious correlation between them, because the saltwater wedge and its inducing vertical circulation may have resuspended loose sediment on the bed, thus forming a high-concentration area near the bottom even if the velocity near the bottom was very low during the transition phase from flood to ebb.",2010,,CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY,28,3,609-U1,WOS:000278924100023,10.1007/s00343-010-9254-4,,#19340,Pang 2010,,

To analyse the hydraulic characteristics inside the coastal aquifer, numerical analysis was conducted using a non-hydrostatic Navier-Stokes solver based on the Porous Body Model (PBM), which can directly analyse groundwater flow. A unique saltwater-freshwater equilibrium interface that does not appear in typical coastal aquifer analyses was observed in a sandy tank experiment. In the experiment, the rise of the groundwater level behind the seawall increased the pressure gradient and groundwater flow rate, causing the saltwater-freshwater interface to move towards the sea and a freshwater region to form on the seabed in front of the seawall. The numerical analysis enabled close examination of the groundwater level distribution, groundwater flow, seawater-freshwater interface, and pore water pressure characteristics of the coastal aquifer with underground obstructions. The sandy tank experiment also provided an understanding of the hydraulic characteristics of groundwater in the coastal aquifer with a seawall, which previously could not be accurately analysed. The experimental and analytical results demonstrated that the rise of groundwater level due to underground obstructions in the coastal aquifer increased the pressure gradient and groundwater flow rate and slowed seawater intrusion.

1703,Saline water intrusion in relation to strong winds during winter cold outbreaks: North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary,"Zhang, EF; Gao, S; Savenije, HHG; Si, CY; Cao, S","The strong saline water intrusion in the North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary threatens the freshwater supply of the region in winter half year. Strong northerly winds have been identified as a factor increasing saline water intrusion. However, there are few studies on this subject, and the mechanisms of winds influencing saline water intrusion are still unclear. In the present contribution, we investigate the variation trend of strong wind events during cold outbreaks in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the North Branch, together with the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion, based on observations and an analytical salt water intrusion model. The results indicate that the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events and saline water intrusion in the North Branch have similar variation trends in 1994-2008, both being relatively weak in the 1990s but being intensified dramatically after 1999. The significant correlation between these two trends suggests that the increase in strong wind events may be one of the factors inducing the enhanced saline water intrusion. Observations and model output show that the strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup, increase of flood-tide current velocities, decrease of ebb-tide velocities, and decrease of freshwater inflow into the North Branch. These changes in combination cause the enhanced intensity of saline water intrusion. The Elanan transport from remote winds results in water level setup at the estuary mouth pumping more seawater into the North Branch, which should be a dominant mechanism inducing the change in hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,574,,1099-1109,WOS:000476962800087,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.096,,#19349,Zhang 2019,,

Arid and semi-arid regions such as Southern California are especially vulnerable to anticipated negative impacts of global warming on water resources, Long-range water facility planning must consider global climate change in the recommended mix of new facilities needed to meet future water requirements. The generally accepted impacts of global warming include increased temperature, rising sea levels, more frequent and severe floods and droughts, and a shift from snowfall to rain. Precipitation changes are more difficult to predict. For Southern California, these impacts will be especially severe on surface water supplies. Additionally, rising sea levels will exacerbate salt-water intrusion into freshwater and impact the quality of surface water supplies. Integrated water resources planning is emerging as a tool to develop water supplies and demand management strategies that are less vulnerable to the impacts of global warming. These tools include water conservation, reclamation, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and desalination of brackish water and possibly seawater.

Here, we report on research to quantify the production of CH3Cl in response to varying levels of salinity from calcareous periphyton mats found within the Florida Everglades, USA, the first measurements of their kind. Periphyton were collected from the Everglades and exposed to continuous, artificially simulated 12 h dark: 12 h light cycles, in both freshwater and varying concentrations of saltwater. Water samples were collected and analyzed to determine the resulting production rate of CH3Cl. We found that periphyton produced CH3Cl in both freshwater and all concentrations of saltwater (24 to 208 fmol CH3Cl gDW(-1) periphyton h(-1) after 24 h) and that there was a significant positive effect of salinity on the production rate of CH3Cl (r(2) = 0.993, p < 0.001). Our results indicate that rising sea levels as predicted by climate models will increase production rates of CH3Cl in coastal periphyton wetlands that could be inundated with high salinity seawater.

Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of tidal oscillations on the behavior of the saltwater wedge. For the conditions examined, the experiments showed that an upper saline plume formed in the intertidal zone due to tide-induced seawater circulation. The presence of the upper saline plume shifted the fresh groundwater discharge zone seaward to the low-tide mark and restricted the intrusion of the saltwater wedge. The overall seawater intrusion extent, as indicated by the wedge toe location, was reduced significantly compared with the nontidal (static) case. Results from the numerical model matched these experimental observations and further demonstrated the similar type of tidal influence on the saltwater wedge in a field-scale aquifer system. The Glover (1959) solution for predicting the saltwater wedge was modified to account for the tidal effect by including the tide-induced circulation as a ""recharge"" to the aquifer.

1717,Thermal Effects on Flow and Salinity Distributions in Coastal Confined Aquifers,"Pu, L; Xin, P; Nguyen, TTM; Yu, XY; Li, L; Barry, DA","Coastal aquifers provide an important hydrologic connection between terrestrial freshwater and oceanic seawater. Understanding the water flow and salinity distributions in those aquifers is essential to manage seawater intrusion and regional groundwater resources. For the last 50 yr, these processes have been extensively examined; however, previous studies typically assumed isothermal conditions and overlooked groundwater-seawater temperature contrasts, as commonly found along the global coastline. Here, we validated a solute and heat transport model against laboratory experiments and then revisited the classical Henry problem for coastal confined aquifers. We found that as the seawater temperature increases or freshwater temperature decreases, the freshwater-seawater interface retreats seaward and thus the freshwater storage increases. This occurs as a result of temperature-induced changes to the fluid density and aquifer hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, double diffusion of salt and heat can induce two circulation cells in opposing directions in the saltwater wedge once the seawater temperature exceeds that of groundwater by a certain extent. Consequently, the circulating seawater flux and associated travel time change dramatically compared with isotheral conditions. Overall, the effect of thermal forcing can be significant, as demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis considering a large range of groundwater-seawater temperature contrasts. These results highlight the impact of changing thermal regimes on the flow and salinity distributions in coastal confined aquifers and provide guidance for better assessment of water resources in coastal zones.",2020,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,56,10,,WOS:000586456800056,10.1029/2020WR027582,,#19388,Pu 2020,,
1719,Transience of seawater intrusion in response to sea level rise,"Watson, TA; Werner, AD; Simmons, CT","Understanding seawater intrusion (SWI) induced by sea level rise (SLR) is important for the future management of many coastal aquifers. Only simplified steady state sharp interface analyses of generalized SLR-SWI exist in the literature, and the important issue of associated time scales has been neglected. We employ numerical modeling in order to explore the transience of dispersive SLR-SWI in common unconfined coastal aquifer settings. An instantaneous SLR is adopted to compare with the instantaneous sea level drop (SLD) case of a previous SLD-SWI analysis. Temporal asymmetry between the SWI responses to SLR and SLD is observed. A SLR-SWI simulation series indicates that toe ""representative response times"" (time to reach 95% of new steady state) range from decades to centuries for a 1 m SLR. Significant discrepancies between the representative response times of various SWI quantitative indicators (e. g., toe position, wedge center-of-mass) are observed. This demonstrates that the indication of steady state SWI conditions depends upon the monitoring approach and thus holds implications for studies reporting that SWI steady state has been attained. We adopt 100 years as a typical ""planning time frame"" and compare 100 year and steady state SLR-SWI. As expected, the simplified steady state sharp interface solution overpredicts the 100 year landward toe shift in most cases. However, some simulations exhibit temporary ""overshoot"" of the steady state interface position: this is in contradiction to the presumption that steady state SWI is the worst case. Steady state sharp interface estimates appear to be at best useful as initial approximations of SLR-SWI, given that they span 40%-250% of 100 year dispersive interface results for the cases considered.",2010,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,46,,,WOS:000285259900005,10.1029/2010WR009564,,#19391,Watson 2010,,
1721,Pacific modulation of accelerated south Indian Ocean sea level rise during the early 21st Century,"Jyoti, J; Swapna, P; Krishnan, R; Naidu, CV","The south Indian Ocean has shown an unprecedented sea-level rise during the early 21st Century. Sea-level rise in the south Indian Ocean is found to be 37% quicker than the global mean sea-level during 2000-2015. Observational datasets and long-term proxy records identify Pacific origin of the south Indian Ocean sea-level rise. Our results indicate that co-evolution of the cold phase of Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and prolonged La Nina-like condition enhances the equatorial Pacific easterlies. Stronger in-phase association of these major Pacific climate modes and equatorial Pacific easterlies enhances the Indonesian throughflow (ITF), transporting fresh and warm water anomalies from western tropical Pacific into the south Indian Ocean. As a result, south Indian Ocean sea-level rise has accelerated more than the global, with 40% contribution from the halosteric sea level primarily through the ITF transport and a secondary from the local processes during 2000-2015. The co-evolution of PDO and the south Indian Ocean sea level is also evident from the long-term proxy records indicating that the association is part of an internal mode of variability modulated on decadal time-scales. The finding from the study cautions that accelerated heat and freshwater intrusion from the western Pacific with the co-evolution of PDO and La Nina-like condition may lead to the accelerated sea-level rise and marine heat waves in the south Indian Ocean imposing threats to the life of coral reefs and marine ecosystems.",2019,,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,53,7-8,4413-4432,WOS:000489753900037,10.1007/s00382-019-04795-0,,#19393,Jyoti 2019,,

The physical model, a two-dimensional rectangular flow tank, is filled with layered aquifers and aquitards. The aquifers serve as the main entrances/exits of water to/from the system through significant horizontal flows, creating unstable conditions of heavier saline water above lighter freshwater for short periods of time. Several processes create mixing; this instability results in haline convection, creating downward fingering, stable rising of horizontal saltwater front, and unstable upward fingerings of flushing freshwater. The time lag between the sea tide fluctuations and the emergence of adequate fresh- and saltwater is higher in a stratified system compared to a homogeneous system. Furthermore, longer tide cycles lead to the enlargement of the FSI's toe horizontal movement range. The combination of tidal forcing with a layering aquifer structure leads to a wider FSI by creating a significant salt- and freshwater mixing inside each layer, vertical flows between the layers, and saltwater bodies at isolated areas. Haline convection within the FSI might be the reason for the wider fresh-saline interfaces that are found in field studies.",2021,,WATER,13,13,,WOS:000671273200001,10.3390/w13131780,,#19394,Ben-Zur 2021,,

1724,Persistent Ross Sea Freshening From Imbalance West Antarctic Ice Shelf Melting,"Jacobs, SS; Giulivi, CF; Dutrieux, P","A 63-year observational record in the southwest Ross Sea shows a continuing, near-linear salinity decrease of 0.170 and slight warming of 0.013 degrees C through 2020. That freshening exceeded any increase in sea ice production and brine release from stronger southerly winds, while melting and freezing at the Ross Ice Shelf base contributed little to the salinity change. The parallel seawater density decline appears not to have enhanced warm deep water intrusions onto the continental shelf (CS). Confirming prior inferences, the salinity change has been mainly caused by a growing imbalance in the meltwater available from thinning ice shelves and increased iceberg calving in the upstream Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. Shorter-term salinity variability has tracked winds near the Amundsen Sea CS break, in turn coherent with a broader Pacific climate variability index, and with salinity reversals on and seaward of the Ross CS. The melt driven freshening is positively correlated with global atmospheric CO2 and temperature increases, and adds to the rise in sea level from increased glacier flow into weakened ice shelves. Continued erosion of those ice shelves could end the production of high salinity shelf and bottom waters, as defined in the Ross Sea, by the 2050s.Plain Language Summary Prior reports of salinity change in the Ross Sea have relied on selected observations over a limited area, and assumptions about a probable cause. In this study we documented freshening over 63 years, accompanied by slight warming, from measurements obtained during 43 summers in a wider region on the southwest Ross continental shelf. Minor net melting under the adjacent Ross Ice Shelf may have helped to offset additional brine release by sea ice formation under stronger surface winds. However, most of the freshening has resulted from an increasing volume of West Antarctic ice shelf and iceberg meltwater transported westward by coastal and slope currents. Seawater density is dominated by salinity at cold temperatures, parameters that began to reveal change similar to 50 years ago as a shifting atmospheric circulation increased ""warm"" deep water access to vulnerable ice shelves. Downstream freshening of the Ross Sea and its Antarctic Bottom Water then resulted from meltwater sources that have increased by more than 10 billion tons each year, a remote impact of anthropogenic climate change with regional to global effects on ocean properties and sea level.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,3,,WOS:000776507900024,10.1029/2021JC017808,,#19398,Jacobs 2022,,

Nearly all of the silt comes in runoff from the immense and highly erodible Loess Plateau. Salinity has a secondary but widespread effect on irrigation development and groundwater quality. Engineering structures and expanded irrigation have reduced the silt load in the lower reach of the river by half over the last 50 years. Still, the level of the river bed continues to rise higher above the surrounding North China Plain. Millions of rural and urban lives are threatened by the possibility that an embankment will break and unleash a horrendous flood, as had happened numerous times prier to 1949. Earthquakes could cause similar castrophes. Increased populations in cities, expansion of irrigated land, and rapid industrialization have brought about locally severe water shortages. This, in turn, has led to surface and groundwater pollution by salt and heavy metals, lowering of groundwater levels, land subsidence, and salt water intrusion from the Bo Sea. Interbasin water transfers from the Yangtze River in the south to relieve water shortages in the north have been proposed for decades but remain controversial. The high cost of dams, canals, tunnels, pumping, and water control systems needed for the transfer has been a major objection. Other factors have been the adverse environmental impact in both the Yellow and Yangtze river watersheds of transfers and, importantly, the questionable need of the transfers if water conservation practices were used widely and effectively.",2001,,GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL,167,,7-22,WOS:000167926800001,10.1111/1475-4959.00002,,#19402,Mei 2001,,
1738,Numerical assessment of compressed air injection for mitigating seawater intrusion in a coastal unconfined aquifer,"Zang, YG; Li, M","Subsurface fluids injection is a viable alternative for controlling seawater intrusion in coastal regions, and freshwater is usually served for valid fluids to generate pressure ridge towards the ocean. But other fluids injection, such as compressed air, which presents clean and readily available, is a more attractive solution for repulsing the intruded seawater where freshwater is insufficient. In this study, the performance of compressed air injection (i.e., air barriers) for mitigating seawater intrusion in a coastal unconfined aquifer was quantificationally assessed using a coupled water-air two-phase flow and saltwater transport model. As compressed air is introduced into the aquifer at the toe of saltwater wedge, the seaward hydraulic gradient adjacent to the coast is produced driven by the generated airflow, thereby causing salt-freshwater interface to retreat to the ocean. The magnitude of air injection rate, related to the operational cost of air barriers, does not increases significantly given the progressively decreasing change rate. Compared to the workability of air barriers in the confined aquifer under similar conditions, the reduction in intruded seawater at 365.0 d in the unconfined aquifer reaches only about 0.45 times that in the confined aquifer, which indicates the significance of the boundary condition of aquifer top. The sensitivity analysis of the overlying unsaturated zone reveals that with its permeability decreasing or its thickness increasing, the performance of air barriers is enhanced owing to the blocking effect of the overlying layer on the escape of generated airflow and tends progressively to be stable. Particularly, the efficacy of air barriers in the confined aquifer, including the reduction in intruded seawater and the air injection rate, also can be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient-semipermeable layer.",2021,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,595,,,WOS:000641592600029,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125964,,#19451,Zang 2021,,
1739,Analytical solutions of seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers,"Lu, CH; Xin, P; Kong, J; Li, L; Luo, J","Sloping coastal aquifers in reality are ubiquitous and well documented. Steady state sharp-interface analytical solutions for describing seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers are developed based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation. Specifically, analytical solutions based on the constant-flux inland boundary condition are derived by solving the discharge equation for the interface zone with the continuity conditions of the head and flux applied at the interface between the freshwater zone and the interface zone. Analytical solutions for the constant-head inland boundary are then obtained by developing the relationship between the inland freshwater flux and hydraulic head and combining this relationship with the solutions of the constant-flux inland boundary. It is found that for the constant-flux inland boundary, the shape of the saltwater interface is independent of the geometry of the bottom confining layer for both aquifer types, despite that the geometry of the bottom confining layer determines the location of the interface tip. This is attributed to that the hydraulic head at the interface is identical to that of the coastal boundary, so the shape of the bed below the interface is irrelevant to the interface position. Moreover, developed analytical solutions with an empirical factor on the density factor are in good agreement with the results of variable-density flow numerical modeling. Analytical solutions developed in this study provide a powerful tool for assessment of seawater intrusion in sloping coastal aquifers as well as in coastal aquifers with a known freshwater flux but an arbitrary geometry of the bottom confining layer.",2016,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,52,9,6989-7004,WOS:000386977900016,10.1002/2016WR019101,,#19454,Lu 2016,,
1744,Simulation of seawater intrusion in the Nile Delta aquifer under the conditions of climate change,"Abd-Elhamid, H; Javadi, A; Abdelaty, I; Sherif, M","The problem of seawater intrusion is encountered in almost all coastal aquifers. Because of its higher density, the seawater migrates inland into freshwater aquifers even without any pumping activities. Excessive pumping of groundwater would accelerate seawater intrusion. Climate change and sea level rise represent critical parameters affecting the rate and degree of seawater intrusion. In this paper, a coupled transient finite element model for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated soils (2D-FEST) is employed to study the seawater intrusion in the Nile Delta aquifer. The results of the current model are compared to results of SEAWAT for model verification. The (2D-FEST) model is used to investigate seawater intrusion considering the impacts of climate change. Three scenarios are studied: (a) rise in sea level, (b) decline of the piezometric head at the land side due to excessive pumping, and (c) combination of sea level rise and decline of the piezometric head. The results show that the rise in the sea level has a significant effect on the position of the transition zone. The third scenario represents the worst case under which the groundwater quality would deteriorate in large areas of the Nile Delta aquifer.",2016,,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,47,6,1198-1210,WOS:000390691700008,10.2166/nh.2016.157,,#19463,Abd-Elhamid 2016,,
1745,Using wave runup modeling to inform coastal species management: An example application for sea turtle nest relocation,"Ware, M; Long, JW; Fuentes, MMPB","The inundation of foreshore and backshore coastal environments caused by wave runup or groundwater intrusion can be extremely detrimental for beach-dwelling organisms. For beach-nesting species, whose eggs require sufficient gas exchange with the surrounding environment for proper embryonic development, inundation for prolonged periods can result in embryonic mortality. Management strategies such as the relocation of nests high on the beach to avoid wave action have been applied for some species, though this strategy may result in unnecessary nest manipulation. To improve the identification of beach locations potentially exposed to inundation caused by wave wash-over which may require management action, wave runup models were tested in Fort Morgan, Alabama, USA for the 2016 sea turtle nesting season. The potential exposure of sea turtle nesting sites to wave wash-over was determined by comparing observed nest elevations to the predicted combined elevation of wave runup, tide, and surge (i.e., total water level). Total water level was calculated using three different definitions of beach slope: foreshore, nest, and dune-to-water (DTW), and two LiDAR-derived elevation estimates: the most recent survey from 2016 and a time-averaged digital elevation model (DEM). Models using the time-averaged DEM performed as well as, or better than, those using the 2016 LiDAR survey in the majority of comparisons. Wash-over state was correctly identified for up to 83.3% of sites when using nest slope in the wave runup calculation. However, DTW slope performed the best when predicting the wash-over frequency of a site. Mapping of the predicted 98th percentile of wave runup indicated that only 11.2% of nesting sites were exposed to wave wash-over, in contrast to the 21.3% of nests which were relocated. Wave runup models have not previously been used to inform sea turtle conservation actions; however, it holds promise for improved targeted management interventions and can assist other species (e.g., shorebirds, beach mice), which rely on dry beach habitat for nesting, feeding, and migratory rest stops. Wave runup models can also be used to investigate past storm events, forecast approaching storm impacts, and supplement sea level rise scenarios for coastal species management at multiple spatial scales.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,173,,17-25,WOS:000465057000003,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.02.011,,#19469,Ware 2019,,
1747,"Impact of spate irrigation of flood waters on agricultural drought and groundwater recharge: case of Sidi Bouzid plain, Central Tunisia","Monji, H; Dhouha, L; Rajouene, M; Habib, A","In Sidi Bouzid plain, rainfall alone is insufficient to satisfy crop water requirements. Within this framework, and in order to improve water resources in the region, the Tunisian State adopted non-conventional water mobilization techniques, among which artificial spate irrigation. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of spate irrigation of flood water on the mitigation of agricultural drought and the enhancement of groundwater recharge. Annual and monthly rainfall data as well as flood water volumes were monitored. The study focused on the groundwater drawdown monitoring. Results showed a high flood water contribution to crop water requirements that exceeded rainfall. This water prevented drought in the spate perimeters. The groundwater drawdown was found to fluctuate over time, with an average decreasing rate of 0.4 to 0.5 m/year. Groundwater recharge was found to be highly correlated with flood water contribution through spate irrigation (R-2 = 84 %). Out of the spate zone, a high decrease in the groundwater level was noted. The lowest rate of 1 m/year was that of the farthest piezometer from the spate perimeters. This is influenced by the excessive pumping out of the spate zone. In 1980, groundwater flew from the west to the east. In 2015, the flow movement from the east to the center of the plain did not change due to the presence of the spate perimeters. Nevertheless, excessive pumping around sabkhas changed the flow directions at the outlet zone. A variation in groundwater salinity was observed in both space and time. In 1975, salinity was very low. The outlet zone was the most affected where the drawdown reached several meters, causing saltwater intrusion from the surrounding sabkhas.",2016,,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,9,15,,WOS:000385130200005,10.1007/s12517-016-2686-1,,#19482,Monji 2016,,
1748,"Effects of warming, eutrophication and climate variability on acidification of the seasonally stratified North Yellow Sea over the past 40 years","Li, CL; Yang, DZ; Zhai, WD","The North Yellow Sea (NYS) is a productive marginal sea of the western North Pacific. In summer and autumn, CaCO3 saturation states beneath the seasonal thermocline in the NYS have frequently fallen below critical levels, indicating that marine calcifying organisms are under threat. To explore the long-term evolution of the acidification of the NYS, we reconstructed seasonal variations in subsurface aragonite saturation state (omega arag) and pH during 1976-2017, using wintertime and summertime temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH data mainly from a quality-controlled oceanographic database. Over the past 40 years, the wintertime warming rate in the NYS was twice the rate of global ocean surface warming. Warming-induced decrease in CO2 solubility canceled out a part of the wintertime omega arag decrease caused by atmospheric CO2 increase, and also had minor effect on pH changes in winter. Although the NYS is a semi-enclosed marginal sea, its interannual variations of wintertime temperature, salinity, pH and omega arag were correlated to Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a lag of 2-3 years. Due to the eutrophication-induced enhancement of net community respiration beneath the seasonal thermocline, long-term declines of bottom-water omega arag and pH in summer were substantially faster than the declines of assumed air-equilibrated omega arag and pH in spring. Over the past 40 years, the amplitudes of seasonal variations of bottom-water omega arag and pH from spring to summer/autumn have increased by 4-7 times. This amplification has pushed the NYS towards the critical threshold of net community CaCO3 dissolution at a pace faster than that forecast under scenarios of atmospheric CO2 increase. In summary, our results provide insights into the combined effects of ocean warming, eutrophication, atmospheric CO2 rise and climate variability on coastal hydrochemistry, explaining how the environmental stresses on local marine calcifying organisms and the benthic ecosystem increased over the past 40 years.",2022,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,815,,,WOS:000767231800015,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152935,,#19483,Li 2022,,
1750,Ensemble Kalman Filter Assimilation of ERT Data for Numerical Modeling of Seawater Intrusion in a Laboratory Experiment,"Bouzaglou, V; Crestani, E; Salandin, P; Gloaguen, E; Camporese, M","Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is a worldwide problem exacerbated by aquifer overexploitation and climate changes. To limit the deterioration of water quality caused by saline intrusion, research studies are needed to identify and assess the performance of possible countermeasures, e.g., underground barriers. Within this context, numerical models are fundamental to fully understand the process and for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions to contain the saltwater wedge; on the other hand, they are typically affected by uncertainty on hydrogeological parameters, as well as initial and boundary conditions. Data assimilation methods such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) represent promising tools that can reduce such uncertainties. Here, we present an application of the EnKF to the numerical modeling of a laboratory experiment where seawater intrusion was reproduced in a specifically designed sandbox and continuously monitored with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Combining EnKF and the SUTRA model for the simulation of density-dependent flow and transport in porous media, we assimilated the collected ERT data by means of joint and sequential assimilation approaches. In the joint approach, raw ERT data (electrical resistances) are assimilated to update both salt concentration and soil parameters, without the need for an electrical inversion. In the sequential approach, we assimilated electrical conductivities computed from a previously performed electrical inversion. Within both approaches, we suggest dual-step update strategies to minimize the effects of spurious correlations in parameter estimation. The results show that, in both cases, ERT data assimilation can reduce the uncertainty not only on the system state in terms of salt concentration, but also on the most relevant soil parameters, i.e., saturated hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity. However, the sequential approach is more prone to filter inbreeding due to the large number of observations assimilated compared to the ensemble size.",2018,,WATER,10,4,,WOS:000434954900051,10.3390/w10040397,,#19488,Bouzaglou 2018,,

In the present study, Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniffora communities in the intertidal zone of the Yangtze estuary were selected for investigating CH4 flux under different temperature (natural/warming), water level (high/low), and salinity (0, 5, 15, and 30 parts per thousand) conditions. The average CH4 flux (from April to October 2016) under natural conditions was 141.0 +/- 21.5 and 502.8 +/- 65.3 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for P australis and S. alterniflora communities, respectively. Warming had a particularly pronounced effect on CH4 emissions from the P. australis community and increased CH4 flux by 130%. There was a significant correlation between CH4 flux and water level; at high water levels, CH4 flux was 2.64- and 3.78-fold higher in P. australis and S. alterniflora communities, respectively. Salinity had a significant pronounced effect on CH4 emissions from the P australis community, and there was a clear order (5 parts per thousand > 15 parts per thousand > 0 parts per thousand> 30 parts per thousand) in CH4 flux. The interaction between temperature and water level was the most important factor controlling CH4 flux from wetlands; CH4 emissions were greater at higher temperature and higher water levels. However, at low water level, the effect of salinity was more prominent. The results suggest that CH4 flux from estuarine wetlands could be further enhanced in the future under the influence of rising sea levels due to global warming.",2019,,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,83,5,1368-1377,WOS:000489737600010,10.2136/sssaj2018.12.0472,,#19498,Liu 2019,,

Coastal areas include complex ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangrove, salt marshes, seagrasses, etc. Global climate change accelerated by human activities affects the physical, biological, and biogeochemical characteristics of the coastal regions. Consequently the ecological structure, their functions, and the goods and services of the coastal regions are being modified. The ecosystem resilience will be greatly reduced through human impacts as well as rising sea levels, increasing sea temperatures, and other climate ocean-related changes, including prevailing wave activity and storm waves and surges. Sea level rise and increased seawater temperatures are projected to accelerate beach erosion and cause degradation of natural coastal defences such as mangroves and coral reefs resulting in negative effect on the socio-economic aspects of coastal population.

1757,A 3-D numerical study of salinity variations in the Bohai Sea during the recent years,"Mao, XY; Jiang, WS; Zhao, P; Gao, HW","Salinity is an important component of the marine system. Previous studies indicated that the mean salinity in the Bohai Sea had increased by 2.0 psu in the second half of the 20th century, mainly due to a sharp decrease in the Yellow River runoff, and also the effects of large-scale climatic variations and the intrusions of the North Yellow Sea Water (NYSW). Since 2002, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has carried out the flow regulation at the beginning of every flood season, resulting in more discharge of the Yellow River freshwater into the Bohai Sea. In this study, the variations of salinity in the Bohai Sea during the recent years are investigated using a well-established three-dimensional baroclinic model, HAMburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM). The simulation results show that the Yellow River diluted water was mainly discharged into the Laizhou Bay, so the remarkable increase in the Yellow River runoff after 2002 led to a regime shift of salinity in the Laizhou Bay. However, in other parts of the Bohai Sea, salinity variation was influenced by the surrounding rivers or the intrusions of NYSW, and has little relation with the Yellow River runoff. As a whole, advection is more important than diffusion in the salinity distribution, and seasonal oscillation is the main feature of salinity variation. Via several case studies, evaporation and precipitation rates are found to be important in the long-term simulation of salinity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The inner rules of salt water and fresh water mixing system can be expressed by fractal characteristic values (fractal dimension D and fractal proportionality constant A). Larger fractal dimension D means more homogeneous saline vertical distribution and salt-fresh mixing degree is higher. Fractal proportionality constant A and salinity intrusion intensity have positive correlation. The following conclusions can be drawn. The salt-fresh water mixing degree and salinity intrusion intensity decrease from outside to inside in North Branch of Yangtze Estuary. The curve graph of daily salinity is similar with the tidal level. The maximum of salinity occurs near tidal flood and the minimum occurs near the tidal ebb. The mixture degree during the spring tide is larger than that during the neap tide. The salinity outside the estuary doesn't change much during one spring-neap tide cycle.

For the simulation, we used the ensemble method applied to five models (MARS, GLM, GAM, RF and BRT). High AUC and TSS values indicated ""good"" to ""excellent"" accu-racy. RF and GLM obtained the best and worst values, respectively. The model predicted local extinctions and new colonization in the upper estuarine zones.

It is currently experiencing high rates of relative sea-level rise of about 5 mm/year, reflecting anthropogenic climate change and land subsidence. This is expected to accelerate further through the 21st Century, so there are concerns that the GBM delta will be progressively submerged. In this context, a core question is: can sedimentation on the delta surface maintain its elevation relative to sea level? This research seeks to answer this question by applying a two-dimensional flow and morphological model which is capable of handling dynamic interactions between the river and floodplain systems and simulating floodplain sedimentation under different flow-sediment regimes and anthropogenic interventions. We find that across a range of flood frequencies and adaptation scenarios (including the natural polder-free state), the retained volume of sediment varies between 22% and 50% of the corresponding sediment input. This translates to average rates of sedimentation on the delta surface of 5.5 mm/yr to 7.5 mm/yr. Hence, under present conditions, sedimentation associated with quasi-natural conditions can exceed current rates of relative sea-level rise and potentially create new land mass. These findings highlight that encouraging quasi-natural conditions through the widespread application of active sediment management measures has the potential to promote more sustainable outcomes for the GBM delta. Practical measures to promote include tidal river management, and appropriate combinations of cross-dams, bandal-like structures, and dredging.",2022,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,829,,,WOS:000791200600009,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154547,,#19523,Rahman 2022,,

However, because of population growth and sea-level rise, many coastal aquifers increasingly suffer from salt intrusion, especially in karstic areas where the high permeability and porosity of the rock favours salt penetration. We collected field data from a Mexican karst system to show that sea-level variability at low frequencies (subtidal) may induce salt penetration further inland and generate larger oscillations than those observed at tidal frequencies. Measurements of conductivity and pressure from inland wells (5 and 10 km) and from substantial (similar to 1 m(3) s(-1)) submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) at similar to 2-m depth entering a shallow ocean were analysed. We found that sea and piezometric levels co-oscillated at subtidal frequencies, with a correlation of 0.6 and a differential lag. Conductivity of the SGD resembled that of the aquifer. Intense droughts driven by the 2009 'El Nino' event markedly increased the conductivity of the aquifer and its discharge.

Changes in the matrix, including the inland transgression of salt-tolerant mangroves and the recession of sawgrass marshes, have been attributed to the combination of sea level rise and reductions in fresh water supply. In this study we examined concurrent changes in the composition of the region's tree islands over a period of almost three decades. No trend in species composition toward more salt-tolerant trees was observed anywhere, but species characteristic of freshwater swamps increased in forests in which fresh water supply was augmented. Tree islands in the coastal Everglades appear to be buffered from some of the short term effects of salt water intrusion, due to their ability to build soils above the surface of the surrounding wetlands, thus maintaining mesophytic conditions. However, the apparent resistance of tree islands to changes associated with sea level rise is likely to be a temporary stage, as continued salt water intrusion will eventually overwhelm the forests' capacity to maintain fresh water in the rooting zone.",2014,,WETLANDS,34,,S91-S100,WOS:000345634700009,10.1007/s13157-013-0376-2,,#19536,Ross 2014,,
1770,Long-Term and Interannual Variation of the Steric Sea Level in the South China Sea and the Connection with ENSO,"Xi, H; Zhang, ZZ; Lu, Y; Li, Y","Multisource observation and model data sets, including satellite altimetry, satellite gravimetry (the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission [GRACE]), ocean model (Estimation of the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean [ECCO]), and oceanographic reanalysis data (Ishii), are used to explore the long-term and interannual sea-level variation (SLV) in the South China Sea (SCS) and the connection with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). From 1993 to 2012, the sea level rose at a rate of 4.7 +/- 0.3 mm/y, and the steric component contributed approximately 40-55% of the increase shown in the Ishii data (1.9 +/- 0.3 mm/y) and the ECCO model (2.6 +/- 0.3 mm/yr). Using the GRACE observations from 2003 to 2012 for independent validation, the ECCO-derived steric trend was consistent with the mass-corrected altimetry result, whereas the Ishii data failed to capture the sea-level rise in the central basins. On the interannual scale, both the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and the wavelet coherence (WTC) analysis indicate that the total SLV and the steric SLV have positive correlations with ENSO. The correlation is stronger between the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the ECCO-derived steric SLV than it is between the SOI and the Ishii-based steric SLV. In the time-frequency domain, the WTC shows a clear in-phase coherence in the 2-year cycle between the SOI and the ECCO-derived steric SLV over the entire time span; no significant coherence appears between the SOI and the Ishii-based steric SLV after 2003.

1771,Adsorption and desorption of phosphate on limestone in experiments simulating seawater intrusion,"Price, RM; Savabi, MR; Jolicoeur, JL; Roy, S","This study investigates the potential release of PO(4)(3-) from carbonate aquifers exposed to seawater intrusion. Adsorption and desorption of PO(4)(3-) in the presence of deionized water (DIW) and seawater were conducted on a large block of Pleistocene age limestone to simulate the effects of seawater intrusion into a coastal carbonate aquifer at the laboratory scale. The limestone showed strong adsorption of PO(4)(3-) in DIW, while adsorption was significantly less in the presence of seawater. Dissolution of CaCO(3) was found to prevent PO(4)(3-) adsorption at salinities less than 30 psu. Adsorption of PO(4)(3-) was limited at higher salinities (30-33 psu), due to competition with HCO(3)(-) ions for adsorption sites. At a salinity <33, some PO(4)(3-) absorption occurred as CaCO(3) precipitated. Concentrations of PO(4)(3-) between 2 and 5 mu mol/L were released by desorption when the limestone was exposed to seawater. The results of this study suggest that as seawater intrudes into an originally freshwater coastal aquifer, adsorbed PO(4)(3-) may be released into the groundwater. Consequently, adsorbed PO(4)(3-) is expected to be released from coastal carbonate aquifers world-wide as sea level continues to rise exposing more of the freshwater aquifer to seawater.

In this study, seawater intrusion in a dual-permeability karst aquifer with conduit networks is studied by the two-dimensional density-dependent flow and transport SEAWAT model. Local and global sensitivity analyses are used to evaluate the impacts of boundary conditions and hydrological characteristics on modeling seawater intrusion in a karst aquifer, including hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, specific storage, and dispersivity of the conduit network and of the porous medium. The local sensitivity analysis evaluates the parameters' sensitivities for modeling seawater intrusion, specifically in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP). A more comprehensive interpretation of parameter sensitivities, including the nonlinear relationship between simulations and parameters, and/or parameter interactions, is addressed in the global sensitivity analysis. The conduit parameters and boundary conditions are important to the simulations in the porous medium because of the dynamical exchanges between the two systems. The sensitivity study indicates that salinity and head simulations in the karst features, such as the conduit system and submarine springs, are critical for understanding seawater intrusion in a coastal karst aquifer. The evaluation of hydraulic conductivity sensitivity in the continuum SEAWAT model may be biased since the conduit flow velocity is not accurately calculated by Darcy's equation as a function of head difference and hydraulic conductivity.

1776,Causes for the reversal of North Indian Ocean decadal sea level trend in recent two decades,"Srinivasu, U; Ravichandran, M; Han, WQ; Sivareddy, S; Rahman, H; Li, YL; Nayak, S","Using satellite and in-situ observations, ocean reanalysis products and model simulations, we show a distinct reversal of the North Indian Ocean (NIO, north of 5A degrees S) sea level decadal trend between 1993-2003 and 2004-3013, after the global mean sea level rise is removed. Sea level falls from 1993 to 2003 (Period I) but rises sharply from 2004 to 2013 (Period II). Steric height, which is dominated by thermosteric sea level of the upper 700 m, explains most of the observed reversal, including the spatial patterns of sea level change. The decadal change of surface turbulent heat flux acts in concert with the change of meridional heat transport at 5A degrees S, with both being driven by decadal change of surface winds over the Indian Ocean, to cause sea level fall during Period I and rise during Period II. While the effect of surface net heat flux is consistent among various data sets, the uncertainty is larger for meridional heat transport, which shows both qualitative and quantitative differences amongst different reanalyses. The effect of the Indonesian Throughflow on heat content and thus thermosteric sea level is limited to the South Indian Ocean, and has little influence on the NIO. Our new results point to the importance of surface winds in causing decadal sea level change of the NIO.",2017,,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,49,11-12,3887-3904,WOS:000415579000015,10.1007/s00382-017-3551-y,,#19553,Srinivasu 2017,,
1779,Offshore fresh groundwater in coastal unconsolidated sediment systems as a potential fresh water source in the 21st century,"Zamrsky, D; Essink, GHPO; Sutanudjaja, EH; van Beek, LPH; Bierkens, MFP","Coastal areas worldwide are often densely populated and host regional agricultural and industrial hubs. Strict water quality requirements for agricultural, industrial and domestic use are regularly not satisfied by surface waters in coastal areas and consequently lead to over-exploitation of local fresh groundwater resources. Additional pressure by both climate change and population growth further intensifies the upcoming water stress and raise the urgency to search for new fresh water sources. In recent years, offshore fresh groundwater (OFG) reserves have been identified as such a potential water source. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the global volume of OFG in unconsolidated coastal aquifers using numerical groundwater models. Our results confirm previously reported widespread presence of OFG along the global coastline. Furthermore, we find that these reserves are likely non-renewable resources mostly deposited during glacial periods when sea levels were substantially lower compared to current sea level. We estimate the total OFG volume in unconsolidated coastal aquifers to be approximately 1.06 +/- 0.2 million km(3), which is roughly three times more than estimated previously and about 10% of all terrestrial fresh groundwater. With extensive active and inactive offshore oil pumping present in areas of large OFG reserves, they could be considered for temporary fresh groundwater exploration as part of a transition to sustainable water use in coastal areas on the long run.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,1,,WOS:000736301800001,10.1088/1748-9326/ac4073,,#19560,Zamrsky 2022,,

In the spring and summer of 2019. heavy rainfall and snowmelt in the midwestern United States caused historic flooding of the Mississippi River, warranting two openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to reduce pressure on levees in New Orleans, LA. These openings released an unprecedented volume of freshwater into Lake Pontchartrain and subsequently into the Mississippi Sound. This study investigated the impacts of these freshwater releases on populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and water quality in the western Mississippi Sound and the Bay of St. Louis. Platforms housing oysters and water quality sensors that measured dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were deployed at oyster reef sites. At each reef, native oyster populations were assessed via dredge sampling to determine oyster survival. After 13 days, deployed oysters suffered 100% mortality at all sites except the Henderson Point Reef and Kittiwake Reef, the sites farthest east of the BCS. On September 27, 2019, 62 days following the BCS closing, dredge sampling revealed no live native adult oysters or spat, even at sites where living oysters were collected earlier in the summer.

1782,"A model of the methane cycle, permafrost, and hydrology of the Siberian continental margin","Archer, D","A two-dimensional model of a sediment column, with Darcy fluid flow, biological and thermal methane production, and permafrost and methane hydrate formation, is subjected to glacial-interglacial cycles in sea level, alternately exposing the continental shelf to the cold atmosphere during glacial times and immersing it in the ocean in interglacial times. The glacial cycles are followed by a ""long-tail"" 100 kyr warming due to fossil fuel combustion.The salinity of the sediment column in the interior of the shelf can be decreased by hydrological forcing to depths well below sea level when the sediment is exposed to the atmosphere. There is no analogous advective seawater-injecting mechanism upon resubmergence, only slower diffusive mechanisms. This hydrological ratchet is consistent with the existence of freshwater beneath the sea floor on continental shelves around the world, left over from the last glacial period.The salt content of the sediment column affects the relative proportions of the solid and fluid H2O-containing phases, but in the permafrost zone the salinity in the pore fluid brine is a function of temperature only, controlled by equilibrium with ice. Ice can tolerate a higher salinity in the pore fluid than methane hydrate can at low pressure and temperature, excluding methane hydrate from thermodynamic stability in the permafrost zone. The implication is that any methane hydrate existing today will be insulated from anthropogenic climate change by hundreds of meters of sediment, resulting in a response time of thousands of years.The strongest impact of the glacial-interglacial cycles on the atmospheric methane flux is due to bubbles dissolving in the ocean when sea level is high. When sea level is low and the sediment surface is exposed to the atmosphere, the atmospheric flux is sensitive to whether permafrost inhibits bubble migration in the model. If it does, the atmospheric flux is highest during the glaciating, sea level regression (soil-freezing) part of the cycle rather than during deglacial transgression (warming and thawing).The atmospheric flux response to a warming climate is small, relative to the rest of the methane sources to the atmosphere in the global budget, because of the ongoing flooding of the continental shelf. The increased methane flux due to ocean warming could be completely counteracted by a sea level rise of tens of meters on millennial timescales due to the loss of ice sheets, decreasing the efficiency of bubble transit through the water column. The model results give no indication of a mechanism by which methane emissions from the Siberian continental shelf could have a significant impact on the near-term evolution of Earth's climate, but on millennial timescales the release of carbon from hydrate and permafrost could contribute significantly to the fossil fuel carbon burden in the atmosphere-ocean-terrestrial carbon cycle.",2015,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,12,10,2953-2974,WOS:000356179300009,10.5194/bg-12-2953-2015,,#19566,Archer 2015,,

Comparison is based on quantitative indicators that include the interface toe location, saltwater volume, and maximum net extraction rate (for scenario 2). We introduce a method to determine the maximum net extraction rate for cases where the locations of stagnation points cannot be easily derived. Analytical analysis shows that the performances of injection and infiltration are the same, provided that the pond shape is circular. The examination of scenario group 1 suggests that the shape of the infiltration pond has a minor effect on the interface toe location as well as the reduction in the saltwater volume, given the same total recharge rate. The investigation of scenario group 2 indicates, by contrast, that the maximum net extraction rate increases significantly with the increasing ratio of b to a, where a and b are semiaxes of the ellipse parallel and perpendicular to the coastline, respectively. Specifically, for a typical aquifer assumed, an increase of 40% is obtained for the maximum net extraction when b/a increases from 1/200 to 200.

Seafood is widely consumed in this region, with an average of 16.5 Kg/capita/year, and one fourth of the seafood supply comes from aquaculture activities. The Mediterranean aquaculture sector has expanded over the last decades. It increased 77 % over the last decade reaching circa 1.3 million tons in 2009. The value ranged around 3.700 millions US dollars, representing 3.4 % of the global aquaculture value. The growth of seafood demand in the Mediterranean is expected to increase in the future, especially in southern countries. Yet, during the 21st century, the Mediterranean basin is expected to observe: (i) an increase in air temperature between 2.2 degrees C to 5.1 degrees C, (ii) a significant decrease in rainfall (ranging between -4 and -27), (iii) an increase in drought periods related to high frequency of days during which the temperature would exceed 30 degrees C, (iv) an increase of the sea level (around 35 cm) and saline intrusion. Moreover, extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts or floods, are also likely to be more frequent and violent. Here, we review the present status of the Mediterranean aquaculture (e.g. production trends, main farmed species, production systems, major producing countries), the most relevant impacts of climate change to this sector (e.g. temperature, eutrophication, harmful algae blooms, water stress, sea level rise, acidification and diseases), and provide a wide range of adaptation and mitigation strategies that can be implemented to minimize such climatic effects.",2014,,MEDITERRANEAN SEA: ITS HISTORY AND PRESENT CHALLENGES,,,605-616,WOS:000363461600038,10.1007/978-94-007-6704-1_3710.1007/978-94-007-6704-1,,#19582,Rosa 2014,,

Plants that widely distributed in tidal flats play an important role in protecting the coastline from erosion, and mitigating extreme nature hazards. In this paper, based on the finite volume method (FVM), an explicit depth-averaged 2D model is established to investigate the interaction between salt marsh plants and storm surges in estuarine wetland waters. The Roe approximate Riemann solver, coupled with a drying-wetting boundary technique, is proposed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of interface fluxes for tracking the moving coastline and calculating storm surge land intrusions. The drag force induced by vegetation is added to momentum equations as an internal source to express the vegetation resistance to storm surges. The Jelesnianski 65 typhoon model is adopted to simulate the wind and pressure fields of the storm surges, and the background wind field is included in the total wind field. The proposed model is applied to investigate tidal levels, storm surges and flow currents during Typhoon Winnie and Typhoon Matsa in the Bohai Sea. Moreover, the model is used to explore the land intrusion and storm surge attenuation in Liao River Estuary (LRE) wetlands during Typhoon Winnie. Numerical predictions are found to match perfectly with those given by the measured data. The storm surge model can accurately reproduce the storm surge inundation process in wetland waters. The simulated results also indicate that salt marsh plants can reduce the flow current in vegetated regions, thus effectively attenuating the potential threats of storm surges.",2020,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,1383-1388,WOS:000537556600253,10.2112/SI95-267.1,,#19584,Zhang 2020,,
1796,Hydrodynamic behavior of the Cape Fear River and estuarine system: A synthesis and observational investigation of discharge-salinity intrusion relationships,"Becker, ML; Luettich, RA; Mallin, MA","Transport of constituents in partially mixed estuaries depends on the relative strengths of dominant forcing mechanisms which may include tides, river input, and wind. In this study, we investigated the major physical mechanisms that influence the salinity structure in the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE), a partially mixed estuary that is representative of river-dominated estuaries along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. Based on analysis of observed hydrographic and hydrodynamic data, we first describe differences in velocity, salinity, and stratification at along-channel sections of the estuary for relatively low-flow conditions. We then investigate the influence of river inflow on the salinity intrusion (defined by the 1-salinity contour near the bottom), based on six methods of choosing discharge in order to identify an appropriate means of incorporating flow history into the discharge value.Our analyses indicate: 1) 92 percent of the variability in the length of the salinity intrusion over a five-year period can be explained based on the Hydrologic Flood Method identified in this work, 2) the salinity intrusion depends more weakly on discharge than predicted by classic analytical relationships for exchange-dominated systems in which the intrusion varies with discharge to the power of (-1/3), and 3) intra-tidal and tidal-range differences based on a 29-day modulation significantly influence the salinity structure.Our results suggest that the salinity intrusion location is dependent upon the hydrologic ""flood,"" defined by a peak in the river-discharge hydrograph. The analysis indicates that the new method used to determine discharge in the CFRE can more accurately explain river inflow salinity relationships than previously investigated methods. In river-estuary systems in which hydrologic flood peaks are large relative to base flow, we hypothesize the hydrologic flood model offers a useful tool for predicting the estuarine salinity response to river inflow.

The Nile delta case study was common between the projects. CLIWASEC created an integrated forum for modelling and monitoring to understand potential impacts across sectors. This paper summarises key results from an integrated assessment of potential challenges to water-related security issues, focusing on expected sea-level rise impacts by the middle of the century. We use this common focus to illustrate the added value of project clustering. CLIWASEC pursued multidisciplinary research by adopting a single research objective: sea-level rise related water security threats, resulting in a more holistic view of problems and potential solutions. In fragmenting research, policy-makers can fail to understand how multiple issues can materialize from one driver. By combining efforts, an integrated assessment of water security threats in the lower Nile is formulated, offering policy-makers a clearer picture of inter-related issues to society and environment. The main issues identified by each project (land subsidence, saline intrusion - CLIMB; water supply overexploitation, land loss - WASSERMed; employment and housing security - CLICO), are in fact related. Water overexploitation is exacerbating land subsidence and saline intrusion, impacting on employment and placing additional pressure on remaining agricultural land and the underdeveloped housing market. All these have wider implications for regional development. This richer understanding could be critical in making better policy decisions when attempting to mitigate climate and social change impacts.

1799,Influence of Sea Ice Crack Formation on the Spatial Distribution of Nutrients and Microalgae in Flooded Antarctic Multiyear Ice,"Nomura, D; Aoki, S; Simizu, D; Iida, T","Cracks are common and natural features of sea ice formed in the polar oceans. In this study, a sea ice crack in flooded, multiyear, land-fast Antarctic sea ice was examined to assess its influence on biological productivity and the transport of nutrients and microalgae into the upper layers of neighboring sea ice. The water inside the crack and the surrounding host ice were characterized by a strong discoloration (brown color), an indicator of a massive algal bloom. Salinity and oxygen isotopic ratio measurements indicated that 64-84% of the crack water consisted of snow meltwater supplied during the melt season. Measurements of nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations within the slush layer pool (the flooded layer at the snow-ice interface) revealed the intrusion of water from the crack, likely forced by mixing with underlying seawater during the tidal cycle. Our results suggest that sea ice crack formation provides conditions favorable for algal blooms by directly exposing the crack water to sunlight and supplying nutrients from the under-ice water. Subsequently, constituents of the crack water modified by biological activity were transported into the upper layer of the flooded sea ice. They were then preserved in the multiyear ice column formed by upward growth of sea ice caused by snow ice formation in areas of significant snow accumulation.Plain Language Summary Formation of cracks in sea ice affects the environment associated with biological production and biogeochemical cycling in the surface ocean of sea ice systems. Because cracks are likely to form frequently within the sea ice during the season of ice melting and ice breaking, the contributions of cracks to biological production and biogeochemical cycling may be significant in ice-covered oceans. In the future, the melting of sea ice in polar oceans will strongly affect the output of biogeochemical parameters trapped within sea ice and their use in primary and secondary production within surface oceans. In the case of multiyear, land-fast ice, biogeochemical parameters that accumulate within the ice would be discharged abruptly to ocean surface waters when the multiyear ice breaks up.",2018,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,123,2,939-951,WOS:000427970400013,10.1002/2017JC012941,,#19594,Nomura 2018,,

In layered aquifers, vertical leakage through layers makes the intrusion mechanism different compared to homogeneous one. In this study, series of simulations using dispersive SEAWAT and a developed sharp -interface models have been carried out to investigate gradual and instantaneous SLR (respectively named GSLR and ISLR) effect on SWI into field-scale layered aquifer with constant freshwater inflow boundary condition. Two scenarios have been defined for this purpose, including an aquitard with two different hydraulic conductivities (i.e.K' [L/T] = 0.01 and 0.0001 m/d) that is placed between two extensively higher permeable layers. By SEAWAT, it is found that for ISLR problem with higher aquitard K' value, where freshwater can leak upward across the aquitard, seawater intrude more appreciable into bottom layer rather than the upper one. For the upper layer, seawater intrude toward land at early times but then naturally driven back to almost its original position (called as overshoot). At the second scenario with lower K' where almost no freshwater can leak upward, the ambient freshwater inflow push the lower layer salt wedge back toward the sea. For the GSLR, gradual increment of seawater head lets the freshwater to be delivered into unsaturated part of the upper layer and hence seawater intrudes through the system but with low rate. At the lower layer of higher K' scenario with GSLR, freshwater upward leakage causes SWI more obvious compare to the other scenario and horizontal freshwater flow prevents seawater to intrude through the lower layer. The sharp -interface model successfully predicted the same trend compare to dispersive SEAWAT model but over -predicted the interface line. It weaker matched with SEAWAT result for lower K'scenario where it cannot successfully predict the correct amount of freshwater upward leakage. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the measured flow velocity and salinity data, the salinity diffusion coefficient could be estimated. Finally, with the field data of observing sites on the deepwater navigation channel of the Yangtze Estuary, the diffusion coefficient is calculated and a comparative analysis of simulated and measured of salinity process is made.

The impact of the rise in sea levels due to global warming on SI cannot be ignored. In this paper, the Monte Carlo method is used to analyze the uncertainty in modeling SI. To reduce the computational cost of the repeated invocation of the simulation model as well as time, a surrogate model is established using a radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network method. To enhance the accuracy of the substitution model, input samples are sampled using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The results of uncertainty analysis had a high reference value and show the following: (1) The surrogate model created using the RBF method can significantly reduce computational cost and save at least 95% of the time needed for the repeated invocation of the simulation model while maintaining high accuracy.

1807,Nitrate transport behavior behind subsurface dams under varying hydrological conditions,"Fang, YH; Zheng, TY; Wang, H; Zheng, XL; Walther, M","The construction of subsurface dams for controlling seawater intrusion triggers the accumulation of nitrate upstreamof a dam. This is raising the concerns about nitrate contamination in those regions of coastal aquifers that are supposed to be used as a fresh groundwater source behind a subsurface dam. Research on this subject has been mostly restricted to the use of a simplified sea boundary (e.g., static and no slope), ignoring sea level fluctuations driven by tides. In this study, the combined effect of tides and subsurface dams on nitrate pollution in upstream groundwater was examined through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The results revealed that the difference in the extent of nitrate contamination under various conditions (i.e., static, tidal, static with a dam, and tidal with a dam) was related to the temporal pollution behavior. In the early stage, nitrate contamination in upstream groundwater was essentially identical for different scenarios. Both tides and subsurface dams were found to increase nitrate contamination in upstream aquifers. The extent of nitrate contamination increased with higher tidal amplitudes, whereas the increment was more evident for a large tidal amplitude. The effects of tides and subsurface dams on nitrate contamination were also regulated by the locations and infiltration rates of the pollution source. Interestingly, under the joint action of tides and subsurface dams, the increment in the extent of nitrate pollution was greater than the sumof their individual effects. The increased pollutions caused by subsurface dams and tides were quantified as 9.47% and 37.22%, respectively, whereas the increased value caused by their joint action was measured as 51.10%.

1809,Isotopic and geochemical characterization of salinization in the shallow aquifers of a reclaimed subsiding zone: The southern Venice Lagoon coastland,"Gattacceca, JC; Vallet-Coulomb, C; Mayer, A; Claude, C; Radakovitch, O; Conchetto, E; Hamelin, B","The coastal plain bordering the southern Venice Lagoon is a reclaimed lowland characterized by high subsidence rate, and ground level and water-table depth below sea level. In this agricultural region, where the surface hydrologic network is entirely artificially controlled by irrigation/drainage canals, salinization problems have long been encountered in soils and groundwaters. Here we use isotopic and geochemical tracers to improve our understanding of the origin of salinization and mineralization of the semi-confined aquifer (0-40 m), and the freshwater inputs to this hydrological system. Water samples have been collected at different seasons in the coastal Adriatic Sea, lagoon, rivers and irrigation canals, as well as in the semi-confined aquifer at depths between 12 and 35 m (14 boreholes), and in the first confined aquifer (three boreholes drilled between 40 and 80 m depth). Stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) and conductivity profiles show that direct saline intrusion from the sea or the lagoon is observed only in a restricted coastal strip, while brackish groundwaters are found over the entire topographic and piezometric depression in the centre of the study area. Fresh groundwaters are found only in the most western zone. The sharp isotopic contrast between the western and central regions suggests disconnected hydrological circulations between these two parts of the shallow aquifer. The border between these two regions also corresponds to the limits of the most strongly subsiding zone.Our results can be interpreted in terms of a four end-member mixing scheme, involving (1) marine water from the lagoon or the open sea, (2) alpine and pre-alpine regional recharge waters carried either by the main rivers Adige, Bacchiglione and Brenta (irrigation waters) or by the regional groundwater circulation, (3) local precipitation, and (4) evaporated waters infiltrated from the surface. Infiltration from the surface is also revealed by the stratification of the electrical conductivity profiles, showing that the brackish groundwaters are overlain by a shallow layer of less saline water all over the central depression. In the first confined aquifer, the groundwaters have isotopic compositions similar to the deep groundwaters of the Venetian confined aquifers (40-400 m depth). The isotopic data and the Br/Cl ratio show that the origin of the salinization of the phreatic aquifer can be ascribed to seawater intrusion alone, with no indication of the involvement of deep brines (identified at 450 m depth) in the process.The chemical composition of the saline and brackish groundwaters is characterized by an excess of sodium and a deficit of calcium compared to conservative mixing between fresh groundwaters and seawater. This suggests that the phreatic aquifer is progressively freshening, as a consequence of the beneficial influence of the extensive irrigation/drainage network, including raised canals acting as a hydraulic barrier along the coast. This freshening tendency may have been lasting since the reclamation in the mid-twentieth century, and has probably been accelerated by the ban on groundwater abstraction since the 1970s.

1811,Long-term sustainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in question: An economic assessment of water management alternatives,"Tran, DD; van Halsema, G; Hellegers, PJGJ; Hoang, LP; Ludwig, F","A dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management. Intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl. However, flood-control structures have undermined the water retention capacity, compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems. Effects are both internal and external to farming. Negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs. Negative externalities include increased flood damage, reduced sediment flows, saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion. In this study, we assessed the effects of three dike-agricultural system scenarios on delta-level sustainability, considering both internal and external effects. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature. Our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative. In this scenario, accelerated high-dike construction exacted a cost 136% greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011. Externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture. The scenario of transforming high-dike into low-dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits. Our findings provide a useful input for decision-makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies. They support a transition to low-dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta.",2019,,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,223,,,WOS:000495460400029,10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105703,,#19625,Tran 2019,,
1812,"Uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion in fractured coastal aquifers: Effects of fracture location, aperture, density and hydrodynamic parameters","Koohbor, B; Fahs, M; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Belfort, B; Simmons, CT; Younes, A","In this study we use polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion (SWI) in fractured coastal aquifers (FCAs) which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network (DFN) and variable-density flow (VDF) models. The DFN-VDF model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures. In real field applications, these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model. Thus, we perform global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs. As our conceptual model, we consider fractured configurations of the Henry Problem which is widely used to understand SWI processes. A finite element DFN-VDF model is developed in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics (R). We examine the uncertainty of several SWI metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics. PCE is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden. A new sparse PCE technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost. The Sobol' indices (SIs) are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties. The proposed GSA methodology based on PCE and SIs is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy. It shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution. The imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer. Marginal effects based on the PCE are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on SWI. The findings provide a technical support for monitoring, controlling and preventing SWI in FCAs.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,571,,159-177,WOS:000462692100014,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.052,,#19626,Koohbor 2019,,
1814,Influence of variable salinity conditions in a tidal creek on riparian groundwater flow and salinity dynamics,"Lenkopane, M; Werner, AD; Lockington, DA; Li, L","While recent studies have revealed that tidal fluctuations in an estuary significantly affect groundwater flows and salt transport in the riparian zone, only seawater salinity in the estuary has been considered. A numerical study is conducted to investigate the influence of estuarine salinity variations on the groundwater flow and salt dynamics in the adjacent aquifer to extend our understanding of these complex and dynamic systems. Tidal salinity fluctuations (synchronous with estuary stage) were found to alter the magnitude and distribution of groundwater discharge to the estuary, which subsequently impacted on groundwater salinity patterns and residence times, especially in the riparian zone. The effects of salinity fluctuations were not fully captured by adopting a constant, time-averaged estuarine salinity. The modelling analysis also included an assessment of the impact of a seasonal freshwater flush in the estuary, similar to that expected in tropical climates (e.g. mean estuary level during flood significantly greater than average), on adjacent groundwater flow and salinity conditions. The three-month freshwater flushing event temporarily disrupted the salt distribution and re-circulation patterns predicted to occur under conditions of constant salinity and tidal water level fluctuations in the estuary. The results indicate that the salinity variations in tidal estuaries impact significantly on estuary-aquifer interaction and need to be accounted for to properly assess salinity and flow dynamics and groundwater residence times of riparian zones.

1816,Analytical and numerical analysis of tides and salinities in estuaries; part II: salinity distributions in prismatic and convergent tidal channels,"Kuijper, K; Van Rijn, LC","Estuaries, commonly, are densely populated areas serving the needs of the inhabitants in multiple ways. Often the interests are conflicting and decisions need to be made by the local managers. Intake of fresh water for consumption, agricultural purposes or use by industries may take place within a region not far landward of the limit of salt intrusion. Human interventions (e.g. deepening of the navigation channels) or climate changes (sea level rise, reduction of the river discharge) can bring these intake locations within the reach of saline or brackish water and consequently endanger their function. To support policy and managerial decisions, a profound knowledge of processes associated with the salinity structure in estuaries is required. Although nowadays advanced numerical three-dimensional models are available that are able to cope with the complexity of the physics there is still a need for relatively simple tools for quick-scan actions in a pre-phase of a project or for instructive purposes. The analytical model described in this paper may serve these needs. It computes the maximum salinity distribution using the dispersion coefficient in the mouth as the only model parameter. The model has been calibrated using observational data in a large number of estuaries and experimental data in a tidal flume. The dispersion coefficient was successfully related to geometric and hydrodynamic parameters resulting in an expression that can be used for convergent estuaries as well as prismatic channels, see Eqs. 25a and 25b. Application of the model in a predictive mode showed its promising capabilities. Comparison with three-dimensional numerical models indicates that the channel geometry in the estuary mouth largely influences dispersive processes. The analytical model for salt intrusion may be used in combination with the analytical model for tidal propagation in convergent estuaries and tidal channels by Van Rijn (part I). In this way, input is obtained on the tidal velocity amplitude and the Ch,zy roughness following calibration of this model on tidal amplitudes along the estuary.",2011,,OCEAN DYNAMICS,61,11,1743-1765,WOS:000296638200002,10.1007/s10236-011-0454-z,,#19637,Kuijper 2011,,
1818,Experimental and numerical assessment of saltwater recession in coastal aquifers by constructing check dams,"Mehdizadeh, SS; Ketabchi, H; Ghoroqi, M; Hasanzadeh, AK","Artificial freshwater recharge has been considered as a feasible and effective procedure to mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal regions. The efficiency of freshwater infiltration through a check dam reservoir on saltwater recession (SWR) is investigated using two physical models. The results demonstrate the apparent tendency of recharge freshwater to move horizontally toward the boundaries rather than flowing downward to influence saltwater wedge toe. Thereby, it would affect the saltwater wedge tip instead of its toe due to the new establishment of a positive hydraulic gradient from a dam reservoir to the boundaries. Moreover, numerical dispersive simulations have been carried out on a large-scale aquifer to find the optimum location of the dam as well as the aquifer characteristics impacts on SWR efficiency. The results show that the best location to construct a check dam is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe. It is found that when saltwater head declines, the steeper hydraulic gradient between boundaries is established and the efficiency of recharge performance will be improved. Moreover, the reduction of hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction improves SWR, while higher hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous cases only accelerates the infiltration rate but has no meaningful effect in the long term. The considered recharge method also works better in scenarios with higher dispersivity. However, the construction of check dams on floodways might be a practical and low-cost solution but it can be concluded that as the dominant direction of the recharged freshwater is toward boundaries, it cannot promptly retreat saltwater around toe position.",2020,,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,231,,,WOS:000530026100004,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103637,,#19646,Mehdizadeh 2020,,
1820,Effect of coastal-trapped waves on the synoptic variations of the Yellow Sea Warm Current during winter,"Ding, Y; Bao, XW; Yao, ZG; Song, DH; Song, J; Gao, J; Li, JY","Significant short-term fluctuations of the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) at several days' time scale were observed in the Yellow Sea (YS) during winter of 2006-2007. Observations indicated that the synoptic fluctuations of the YSWC appear to be associated with low-frequency sea level variations. By analyzing direct current measurements, sea level elevations and results from a regional ocean model, this study characterizes the variation of the YSWC at synoptic time scale and examines its connection with propagation of coastal-trapped waves during winter. The model captures the observed short-term fluctuations of the YSWC at several days' periods and suggests a close relation between coastal-trapped waves and the YSWC variability. The YSWC is intensified (weakened) when the westward sea level-related barotropic pressure gradient is enhanced (diminished) due to the propagation of coastal-trapped waves. Model experiments with idealized periodic surface forcing further identify the important role of the coastal-trapped waves on adjusting the strength of the YSWC. The model results also suggest that the propagation of coastal-trapped waves contribute to the intermittent northwestward intrusion of Cheju Warm Current (CWC) in the frontal region northwest of Cheju. Generation and propagation of the coastal-trapped waves give rise to the westward barotropic pressure gradient in the YS entrance, which periodically pumps the CWC water into the YS interior west of Cheju.",2018,,CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH,167,,14-31,WOS:000446284700002,10.1016/j.csr.2018.08.003,,#19654,Ding 2018,,

Global climate change will affect precipitation, sea level, and many other factors, which will in turn affect the simulation and prediction results for seawater intrusion. By combining groundwater numerical simulation technology, an atmospheric circulation model, artificial intelligence methods, and simulation optimization methods, this study coupled a numerical simulation model of seawater intrusion with an optimization model to optimize the groundwater exploitation scheme in the study area under the condition of climate change. As a result, a groundwater exploitation scheme was obtained for a typical study area, which provided a scientific basis and a reference for the rational development of effective groundwater resource solutions. The results of this study can be described as follows. (1) By introducing the theory and method of deep learning from artificial intelligence, the problem of complex nonlinear mapping between the inputs and outputs of a three-dimensional variable-density seawater intrusion numerical simulation model under the condition of limited number of training samples is effectively solved, and the approximation accuracy of the surrogate model with respect to the simulation model is improved.

1823,"Variation in Salinity Tolerance among Larval Anurans: Implications for Community Composition and the Spread of an Invasive, Non-native Species","Brown, ME; Walls, SC","Amphibians in freshwater coastal wetlands periodically experience acute exposure to salinity from hurricane-related overwash events, as well as chronic exposure associated with rising sea levels. In a comparative experimental approach, we examined whether seven species of anuran amphibians vary in their tolerance to changes in salinity. In a laboratory study, we exposed larval Hyla cinerea (Green Treefrog), H. squirella (Squirrel Treefrog), Litho bates catesbeianus (American Bullfrog), L. sphenocephalus (Southern Leopard Frog), Anaxyrus terrestris (Southern Toad), and Gastrophryne carolinensis (Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad) from an inland population in north central Florida, USA, and Osteopilus septentrionalis (Cuban Treefrog) tadpoles from an inland population in southwest Florida, to acute salinity for 72 h. For each species, we replicated trials in which tadpoles were exposed to salinities of 0.2 (control), 5, 10, 12, 14, and 16 ppt. For all species, tadpoles reared in the control and 5 ppt treatments had 96.7-100% survival. No individuals of G. carolinensis survived at salinities exceeding 5 ppt and no individuals of any species survived in the 14 or 16 ppt treatments. For all other native species, survival at 10 ppt ranged from 46.7 to 80%, but declined to 0% at 12 ppt (except for H. cinerea, of which only 3.3% survived at 12 ppt). In contrast, all individuals of the invasive, non-native 0. septentrionalis survived exposure to a salinity of 10 ppt, and survival in this species remained relatively high at 12 ppt. Our results illustrate that the non-native 0. septentrionalis has a higher salinity tolerance than the native species tested, which may contribute to its invasion potential. Moreover, species commonly associated with coastal freshwater wetlands differ in their salinity tolerances, suggesting that salt water intrusion due to storm surges and sea level rise may affect the species composition of these ecosystems.",2013,,COPEIA,,3,543-551,WOS:000335277800022,10.1643/CH-12-159,,#19663,Brown 2013,,

The consequences of global climate change include rising sea levels, which also affect the results of the predictions of seawater intrusion that are based on simulations. It is thus important to examine the impact of the randomness in the rise in sea levels on the uncertainty in the results of numerical simulations that are used to predict seawater intrusion. Deep learning has lately emerged as a popular area of research that has been used to establish surrogate models in this context. In this study, the authors have used deep learning to determine the complex and nonlinear mapping relationship between the inputs and outputs of a three-dimensional variable-density numerical model of seawater intrusion in the case of a limited number of training samples, wherein, this has improved the accuracy of the approximation of the surrogate models. We used the rise in sea level as a random variable, and then applied the Monte Carlo method to analyze the influence of randomness on the uncertainty in the results of the numerical predictions of seawater intrusion.

Using this type of coring device facilitates the recovery of the thick sediment record necessary to analyze transport-reaction processes in response to the postglacial sea-level rise and intrusion of Mediterranean salt water 9 ka ago, and thus, to better characterize key biogeochemical processes and process changes in response to the shift from lacustrine to marine bottom water composition. Complementary data indicate that organic matter degradation occurs in the upper 15 m of the sediment column. However, sulfate reduction coupled with Anaerobic Methane Oxidation (AOM) is the dominant electron-accepting process and characterized by a shallow Sulfate Methane Transition Zone (SMTZ). Net silica dissolution, total alkalinity (TA) maxima and carbonate peaks are found at shallow depths. Pore water profiles clearly show the uptake of K+, Mg2+ and Na+ by, and release of Ca2+ and Sr2+ from the heterogeneous lacustrine sediments, which is likely controlled by chemical reactions of silicate minerals and changes in clay mineral composition. Iron (Fe2+) and manganese (Mn2+) maxima largely coincide with Ca2+ peaks and suggest a close link between Fe2+, Mn2+ and Ca2+ release. We hypothesize that the Fe2+ maxima below the SMTZ result from deep Fe3+ reduction linked to organic matter degradation, either driven by DOC escaping from the shallow sulfate reduction zone or slow degradation of recalcitrant POC. The chemical analysis of dissolved and solid iron species indicates that iron is essentially associated with clay minerals, which suggests that microbial iron reduction is influenced by clay mineral composition and bioavailability of clay mineral-bound Fe(III). Overall, our study suggests that post glacial seawater intrusion plays a major role in shaping redox zonation and geochemical profiles in the lacustrine sediments of the Late Quaternary.",2021,,MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY,123,,,WOS:000598421800002,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104746,,#19672,Ruffine 2021,,

We developed a numerical modeling approach for a partially mixed estuary to simulate long-term alterations to hydrodynamics and transport processes induced from human modifications; two types of partially embanked storm surge barriers across the mouth of Chesapeake Bay were examined. Under modeled scenarios, surge barriers exerted a significant influence on the tide, salinity, residual current, and transport processes. The surge barrier caused (1) a reduction of tidal range inside the estuary, (2) stronger stratification and further salt intrusion, weaker vertical mixing and larger vertical exchange time, and (3) a decrease of bottom inflow in the mainstem and weakened horizontal water exchange. The change of horizontal water exchange and residence time was not a linear response with the barrier size and it varied at different regions of the estuary.

Although many studies have pointed out that enhanced ocean heat delivery onto the Antarctic continental shelf regions can cause significant changes in Antarctic ice-shelf basal melting, the associated physical mechanisms require further research. Here, we perform numerical experiments using an ocean-sea ice model with an ice-shelf component to simulate future projections in Antarctic ice-shelf basal melting in a warming climate, focusing on the driving mechanism and the physical linkages with the seasonal Antarctic sea ice fields and coastal water masses. The model projects a distinct superlinear response of ice-shelf basal melting to future atmospheric warming, demonstrating that future projections of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate bifurcate with the level of global warming. Detailed examinations of sea ice and water masses show that in an extreme warming scenario, a combination of enhanced intrusions of warm deep water and warm summertime surface water can cause the nonlinear response of Antarctic ice-shelf basal melting. A large reduction in Antarctic coastal sea ice and the associated ocean freshening by decreasing coastal sea ice production in winter provide favorable conditions for summertime warm surface water formation and warm deep water intrusions onto some continental shelves. The model results demonstrate that disappearing summertime sea ice along the Antarctic coastal margins in a warming climate heralds the nonlinear increase in Antarctic ice-shelf basal melting, presumably contributing to the negative mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea level rise.",2023,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,36,3,713-743,WOS:000920656500001,10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0079.1,,#19678,Kusahara 2023,,

Hydrogeomorphic regimes foster peat formation, resulting in unique biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. Our sites include regimes that are exposed to sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater intrusion, yet other sites are protected by higher elevations. In this study, we evaluated climatic variables to discern differences in tree ring formation as an indicator of growth among nine stands including micro-tidal, oligohaline sites as well as other protected areas which served as a control. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used, and series were divided into two sub-chronologies, 1895 to 1971 (early) and 1972 to 2018 (recent). AWC growth in response to precipitation parameters, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were largely non-significant but were somewhat reversed among sub-chronologies. Early correlations were primarily negatively correlated with PDSI, while recent correlations were mostly positive, which suggests that even though inundation may reduce photosynthate availability for growth, precipitation has begun to increase growth by alleviating osmotic and toxic stresses associated with seawater. Analysis of climatic variables and tree growth at the reference site found that other anthropogenic stressors associated with ditching exert a greater influence. Hurricane impacts on tree growth exhibited no lasting negative effects; however, an AWC ghost forest report from New Jersey connected mortality to a hurricane.

1838,Impact of climate change in Mediterranean aquaculture,"Rosa, R; Marques, A; Nunes, ML","The Mediterranean Sea is the biggest marginal sea of the Earth and is at the centre of the life for several millions of people. Seafood is consumed widely in this region, with an average of 16.5 kg/capita/year, and one-fourth of the seafood supply comes from aquaculture activities. The Mediterranean aquaculture sector has expanded in recent decades. Production increased by 77% over the past decade reaching about 1.3 million metric tonnes in 2009. The total value of production was around 3700 million US dollars, representing 3.4% of the value of global aquaculture production. The growth of seafood demand in the Mediterranean is expected to increase in the future, especially in southern countries. Yet, during the 21st century, the Mediterranean basin is expected to observe: (i) an increase in air temperature of between 2.2 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C; (ii) a decrease in rainfall of between 4% and 27%; (iii) an increase in drought periods related to a high frequency of days during which the temperature would exceed 30 degrees C; and (iv) an increase of the sea level of around 35 cm and saline intrusion. Moreover, extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts or floods, are likely to be more frequent and violent. This paper reviews the present status of Mediterranean aquaculture (e.g. production trends, main farmed species, production systems, major producing countries), the most relevant impacts of climate change on this sector (temperature, eutrophication, harmful algae blooms, water stress, sea level rise, acidification and diseases) and proposes a wide range of adaptation and mitigation strategies that might be implemented to minimize impacts.",2012,,REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE,4,3,163-177,WOS:000308430600003,10.1111/j.1753-5131.2012.01071.x,,#19697,Rosa 2012,,
1840,Sustainability of fresh groundwater resources in fifteen major deltas around the world,"van Engelen, J; Essink, GHPO; Bierkens, MFP","Population growth, urbanization and intensification of irrigated agriculture in the world's deltas boost the demand for fresh water, with extensive groundwater extraction as a result. This, in turn, leads to salt water intrusion and upconing, which poses a threat to freshwater and food security. Managing fresh groundwater resources in deltas requires accurate knowledge about the current status and behaviour of their fresh groundwater resources. However, this knowledge is scarcely present, especially for groundwater at larger depths. Here, we use three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model simulations over the last 125 ka to estimate the volume of fresh groundwater resources for 15 major deltas around the world. We estimate current volumes of onshore fresh groundwater resources for individual deltas to vary between 10(10) m(3) and 10(12) m(3). Offshore, the estimated volumes of fresh groundwater are generally smaller, though with a considerably higher variability. In 9 out of 15 simulated deltas, fresh groundwater volumes developed over thousands of years. Based on current groundwater extraction and recharge rates, we estimate the time until in-situ fresh groundwater resources are completely exhausted, partly leading to groundwater level decline and mostly replacement with river water or saline groundwater. This straightforward analysis shows that 4 out of 15 deltas risk complete exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources within 300 m depth in 200 years. These deltas also suffer from saline surface water which means their groundwater resources will progressively salinize. With a fourfold increase in extraction rates, seven deltas risk a complete exhaustion within 200 years. Of these seven deltas, six suffer from saline surface water. We stress that the groundwater of these six vulnerable deltas should be carefully managed, to avoid non-renewable groundwater use. The progressive exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources in these deltas will hamper their ability to withstand periods of water scarcity.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,12,,WOS:000999058700001,10.1088/1748-9326/aca16c,,#19702,vanEngelen 2022,,
1841,Timescales of seawater intrusion and retreat,"Lu, CH; Werner, AD","Quantifying the timescales associated with moving freshwater-seawater interfaces is critical for effective management of coastal groundwater resources. In this study, timescales of interface movement in response to both inland and coastal water level variations are investigated. We first assume that seawater intrusion (SWI) and retreat (SWR) are driven by an instantaneous freshwater-level variation at the inland boundary. Numerical modelling results reveal that logarithmic timescales of SWI (lnT(i)) and SWR (lnT(r)) can be described respectively by various simple linear equations. For example, SWI timescales are described by lnT(i) = a + blnh'(f-s), where a and b are linear regression coefficients and h'(f-s) is the boundary head difference after an instantaneous drop of inland freshwater head. For SWR cases with the same initial conditions, but with different increases in freshwater head, lnT(r) = c + d Delta X-T, where c and d are regression coefficients and Delta X-T is the distance of toe response that can be estimated by a steady-state, sharp-interface analytical solution. For SWR cases with the same freshwater head increase, but with different initial conditions, in contrast, lnT(r) = e + fln Delta X-T, where e and f are regression coefficients. The timescale of toe response caused by an instantaneous variation of sea level is almost equivalent to that induced by an instantaneous inland head variation with the same magnitude of water level change, but opposite in direction. Accordingly, the empirical equations of this study are also applicable for sea-level variations in head-controlled systems or for simultaneous variations of both inland and coastal water levels. Despite the idealised conceptual models adopted in this study, the results imply that for a particular coastal aquifer, SWI timescales are controlled by the boundary water levels after variations, whereas SWR timescales are dominated by the distance of toe response.

1842,Modeling Residual Circulation and Stratification in Oujiang River Estuary,"Lin, WB; Wang, YG; Ruan, XH; Xu, Q","A 3D, time-dependent, baroclinic, hydrodynamic and salinity model was implemented and applied to the Oujiang River estuarine system in the East China Sea. The model was driven by the forcing of tidal elevations along the open boundaries and freshwater inflows from the Oujiang River. The bottom friction coefficient and vertical eddy viscosity were adjusted to complete model calibration and verification in simulations. It is demonstrated that the model is capable of reproducing observed temporal variability in the water surface elevation and longitudinal velocity, presenting skill coefficient higher than 0.82. This model was then used to investigate the influence of freshwater discharge on residual current and salinity intrusion under different freshwater inflow conditions in the Oujiang River estuary. The model results reveal that the river channel presents a two-layer structure with flood currents near the bottom and ebb currents at the top layer in the region of seawater influenced on north shore under high river flow condition. The river discharge is a major factor affecting the salinity stratification in the estuarine system. The water exchange is mainly driven by the tidal forcing at the estuary mouth, except under high river flow conditions when the freshwater extends its influence from the river's head to its mouth.",2012,,CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING,26,2,351-362,WOS:000305466200014,10.1007/s13344-012-0027-z,,#19707,Lin 2012,,
1845,Seawater Intrusion in the Coastal Alluvial Aquifers of the Mahanadi Delta Introduction,"Naik, PC","The coastal deltaic regions are areas of dense population and centre for economic growth. The socio-economic development in these regions also depends on the availability of the water resources. In these regions, there is a complex heterogeneous subsurface built up and groundwater is contaminated by various degrees of seawater intrusion with a delicate balance of saline-freshwater interface. The coastal aquifers of the Mahanadi Delta have a similar geo-environmental condition, where the groundwater has been subjected to sea-water intrusion, making it unsuitable for domestic and agricultural use. The available usable fresh water resource is limited here. The frequent cyclones and floods directly contaminate the surface water and the intrusion of the seawater has contaminated the groundwater in many places. Industrialisation and other human activities have put more pressure into this limited groundwater resource. The nature and extent of the different aquifer systems of the area have been delineated by geological, geophysical, hydro-geochemical and remote sensing techniques.",2018,,SEAWATER INTRUSION IN THE COASTAL ALLUVIAL AQUIFERS OF THE MAHANADI DELTA,,,1-10,WOS:000430794100002,10.1007/978-3-319-66511-5_110.1007/978-3-319-66511-5,,#19710,Naik 2018,,
1848,Seasonality of Warm Water Intrusions Onto the Continental Shelf Near the Totten Glacier,"Silvano, A; Rintoul, SR; Kusahara, K; Pena-Molino, B; van Wijk, E; Gwyther, DE; Williams, GD","Warm Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) from the Southern Ocean drives rapid basal melt of the Totten Ice Shelf on the Sabrina Coast (East Antarctica), affecting the mass balance of the grounded Totten Glacier. Recent observations show that MCDW intrudes onto the continental shelf through a depression at the shelf break. Here we investigate such intrusions by combining (1) new oceanographic and bathymetric observations collected for two consecutive years by profiling floats in the depression south of the shelf break, (2) oceanographic measurements collected by conductivity-temperature-depth-instrumented seals on continental slope, and (3) an ocean model. The depression provides a pathway for persistent inflow of warm (0-1 degrees C) MCDW to the inner shelf. In austral autumn and early winter MCDW intrusions were up to 0.5 degrees C warmer and were similar to 75 m thicker than in spring and summer. The seasonality of the flow on the continental slope explains the seasonality of the intrusions. The MCDW layer on the continental slope is warmer and thicker to the east of the depression than to the west. In autumn and early winter a strong, top-to-bottom westward current (Antarctic Slope Current) transports the warmer and thicker MCDW layer along the slope and is diverted poleward at the eastern entrance of the depression. A bottom-intensified eastward current (Antarctic Slope Undercurrent) develops in other months, allowing cooler and thinner intrusions to enter the depression from the west. Our study illustrates how circulation on the Antarctic slope regulates the ocean heat delivery to the continental shelf and ultimately to the ice shelves.",2019,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,124,6,4272-4289,WOS:000477722200046,10.1029/2018JC014634,,#19717,Silvano 2019,,
1851,"Climate-induced Late-Holocene ecological changes in Pichavaram estuary, India","Srivastava, J; Farooqui, A; Hussain, SM","Variation in sedimentology as well as freshwater and marine palynomorphs has been studied in ecological perspective in two 2.5- and 5-m deep sediment cores deposited since 3440 and 3630cal BP, respectively in the central part of Pichavaram mangrove wetland, Cauvery River delta. The palynological and sedimentological results of the sediments reveal a monsoonal circulation and a climatic shift from warm and humid with strengthened monsoon (3630-3190cal BP) to dry and arid (similar to 2750-760cal BP). Since the last millennium (similar to 760cal BP), Pichavaram estuary has been influenced by a similar cyclicity but with a less wet and humid climate due to weakened monsoon conditions. These ecological changes in turn affect the relative sea level rise and fall which is reflected by the variability/extinction of freshwater and marine palynomorphs. The estuary remained an active water channel between similar to 3630 and 2750cal BP, responding to the strengthened monsoon, during which the freshwater algal remains with thecamoebians and marine dinoflagellate cysts and foraminiferal linings both dominated with a ratio of 1.5 for marine/freshwater forms. After this period, since similar to 2750cal BP there has been a dominance of marine forms with a ratio of 4.5 for marine/freshwater forms, indicating fluvio-marine sediment deposition and suggesting the recent landward intrusion of seawater during weakened monsoon conditions.

1858,Modelling of saline intrusion in a long sea outfall with two risers,"Shannon, NR; Mackinnon, PA; Hamill, GA","The quality of coastal waters is affected to a large degree by the dilution and dispersion of wastewater discharged through marine outfalls. Under intermittent or low flows, normal operation of these outfalls is often inhibited by the occurrence of stratified flow and saline intrusion, a phenomenon which results in partial blockage of the system.Having established the validity of a numerical model to predict the main features of stratified flow in an outfall of simple geometry under laminar conditions, further tests were designed to prove its performance under more onerous conditions. The development, results and conclusions from these tests are reported in the current paper.Numerical and experimental tests were carried out using a scale model outfall discharging freshwater into ambient saline water. The tests used two risers in order to generate saline intrusion, where multi-port diffusers are persistently ingressed by saline water.The stratified flow within the long sea outfall was modelled in two dimensions under turbulent conditions, utilising a species model with two fluids (or species) physically interacting on a molecular level.The numerical data provided quantitative evidence of the fundamental mechanisms that take place when saline water enters the outfall diffuser. The comparisons of numerical and experimental results verified the capability of the numerical model to reproduce the main hydrodynamic processes that give rise to saline intrusion but also highlighted discrepancies in the more detailed aspects of the fluid behaviour.",2001,,COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN MULTIPHASE FLOW,29,,299-308,WOS:000171058700028,,,#19740,Shannon 2001,,
1861,Managing Water and Soils to Achieve Adaptation and Reduce Methane Emissions and Arsenic Contamination in Asian Rice Production,"Wichelns, D","Rice production is susceptible to damage from the changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, and in the frequency of major storm events that will accompany climate change. Deltaic areas, in which millions of farmers cultivate from one to three crops of rice per year, are susceptible also to the impacts of a rising sea level, submergence during major storm events, and saline intrusion into groundwater and surface water resources. In this paper, I review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of climate change on rice production and I describe adaptation measures that involve soil and water management. In many areas, farmers will need to modify crop choices, crop calendars, and soil and water management practices as they adapt to climate change. Adaptation measures at the local, regional, and international levels also will be helpful in moderating the potential impacts of climate change on aggregate rice production and on household food security in many countries. Some of the changes in soil and water management and other production practices that will be implemented in response to climate change also will reduce methane generation and release from rice fields. Some of the measures also will reduce the uptake of arsenic in rice plants, thus addressing an important public health issue in portions of South and Southeast Asia. Where feasible, replacing continuously flooded rice production with some form of aerobic rice production, will contribute to achieving adaptation objectives, while also reducing global warming potential and minimizing the risk of negative health impacts due to consumption of arsenic contaminated rice.",2016,,WATER,8,4,,WOS:000375157200032,10.3390/w8040141,,#19746,Wichelns 2016,,
1863,From catchment to coastal zone: examples of the application of models to some long-term problems,"Uncles, RJ","Approaches to the modelling of long-term, large-scale (1-100 year and drainage basin to coastal zone) behaviour are outlined for the catchments of the Humber and Tamar estuaries, UK, and San Francisco Bay, USA. The estuarine environment is particularly difficult to model. Once fluvial materials enter an estuary, sharp chemical gradients and complex physical and biochemical dynamics can result in large changes to the amount, chemical nature and timing of the flux of nutrients and other materials that are transported to the coastal zone. Examples are given both of catchment models for the three systems and of an estuarine model that has been used to estimate contemporary fluxes of some nitrogen species from the Humber catchment to the North Sea, in an attempt to forecast the possible effects associated with climate change. Other applications of long-term models are discussed, including predictions of oxygen isotope ratio distributions in San Francisco Bay, which are of value to palaeo studies, and the dependence of salt intrusion on rising sea level and drought conditions there. Some of the more difficult modelling problems involve the determination of estuarine sediment transport and its consequences. A problem which has received little attention up to now, but which is becoming a very active area of research, is the influence of biota on sediment transport. Longterm modelling of fine sediment transport and its application to contaminant (including radionuclide) transport and dispersion to the coastal zone are discussed for the Tamar Estuary. Other long-term estuarine problems that are discussed include the modelling of seasonal heat fluxes from the Tamar to its coastal zone, and the dispersion of tracers within the coastal zone using three-dimensional simulations of heat, salinity and flow. The article is mainly concerned with simulations that require only reasonably short amounts of time to run on a PC and with models that are not intended to give solutions of great temporal or spatial resolution. Generally, they are intended to provide insights into phenomena and systems. To achieve this, a common feature of the long-term models has been their parameterisation of some intratidal processes, such as sediment resuspension and deposition, or tidal mixing. Provided the parameterisations are physically based and lead to good comparisons with available data, when these exist, then the approach would appear to be a valid 'use' rather than an invalid 'abuse' of models.

1865,Coralline algal and foraminiferal records of the Pliocene paleoclimatic conditions and water-depth changes in the northern South China Sea,"Wu, F; Xie, XN; Coletti, G; Zhu, YH; Chen, BC; Shang, ZL","Detailed paleontological and sedimentological data from the Pliocene interval of core XK-1 allow for a detailed documentation of the carbonate system in the northern South China Sea (SCS). Six facies are identified. Based on a comprehensive analysis of facies changes, the paleoclimatic conditions and paleowater depths during the Pliocene in the Xisha area in the northern SCS are reconstructed. The changes in the abundance of the algal genus Sporolithon and the planktonic foraminifera species Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides quadrilobatus, Globorotalia menardii, and Globigerinoides obliquus indicate that the climate in the SCS gradually became warmer from 5.3 to 4.3 Ma and then cooled from 4.3 to 2.6 Ma, which was attributed to the changes in atmospheric pCO2. The high abundance of encrusting acervulinids and coralline algae and the low coral abundance suggest periods of elevated nutrient level, possibly linked to increases in nutrient input from the higher latitudes. Distinct changes in coralline algal and foraminiferal facies help the reconstruction of paleowater depths during the Pliocene in the Xisha area. The water depth was generally rising from 5.3 to 4.3 Ma and declining afterward, which was similar to that in the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin (located on the northern part of the Xisha area). This similarity indicates that there was a common factor controlling the long-term variation in water depth in the northern SCS. The comparison between paleowater depth changes and global eustatic sea-level fluctuations indicates that the regional tectonic subsidence was important from 5.3 to 4.7 Ma. Such subsidence was probably related to thermal subsidence after the magmatism intrusion activity beneath the basement at the initial stage of the Pliocene. This study indicates that the comprehensive analysis of algal and foraminiferal facies has great potential to recon-struct the climatic conditions and water depths in the ancient times.",2023,,MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY,153,,,WOS:000991243900001,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2023.106276,,#19754,Wu 2023,,
1868,Effects of mixed physical barrier on residual saltwater removal and groundwater discharge in coastal aquifers,"Gao, MP; Zheng, TY; Chang, QP; Zheng, XL; Walther, M","Physical barriers are widely used to control seawater intrusion (SWI). Amongst different kinds of physical barriers, mixed physical barriers (MPBs) are shown to be an effective approach to prevent SWI. However, the system may hinder the discharge of fresh groundwater and the removal of residual saltwater trapped in the inland aquifers of MPBs. Herein, using the validated numerical model, for the first time, we investigated the dynamics of residual saltwater and groundwater discharge after the installation of MPBs. For examining the applicability of MPB and its response to structural variations and hydraulic gradient, the comparison with traditional physical barriers and sensitivity analysis was also carried out. The MPB increased the mixing area of freshwater and saltwater at the beginning of the removal process, resulting in the reduction of the saltwater wedge length (R-L) by 74.6% and the removal of total salt mass (R-M) by 62.6% within the 4% of the total removal time. Meanwhile, the groundwater discharge (Q') rose rapidly after a sharp decline from 100% to 40% in the first stage. As the residual saltwater wedge was retreated, the mixing intensity and removal efficiency decreased substantially in the second stage. Similarly, Q' raised with a declining rate at this stage. The removal efficiency was positively correlated with wall depth and hydraulic gradient and there were optimal distance of the middle spacing and height of lower dam to reach the highest efficiency. The groundwater discharge reduced monotonously with the increase of dam height and wall depth as well as the decrease of barrier spacing and hydraulic gradient. Under certain conditions, the efficiency of MPB in removing residual saltwater could be 40%-100% and 0%-56% higher than that of traditional subsurface dam and cutoff wall, respectively. The laboratory scale conclusions provide valuable physical insight for the real field applications regarding dynamic mechanism and regularity. These findings will always help decision makers choose proper engineering measures and protect groundwater resources in coastal areas.",2021,,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,35,7,,WOS:000678409000010,10.1002/hyp.14263,,#19760,Gao 2021,,
1871,Note on a Surface-Film Delineated Lateral Front at the Head of a Shallow Tidal Creek,"Uncles, RJ","Lateral surface frontal systems have been observed in the upper reaches of a small, low freshwater runoff, strongly tidal creek. They are a very striking visual feature of this water body when delineated by large quantities of surface film material. The fronts are mostly associated with a creek cross-section of somewhat reduced width and mudflat depth (the 'Ridge') compared with adjacent sections. Images are presented that show the tidal intrusion nature of the front and its subsequent development and final down-creek movement as a buoyant plume. Longitudinal and vertical surveys of salinity during a mean-range tide demonstrate the strong stratification that exists in this shallow water body, which, at high water (HW), is typically 1-2 m deep in the narrow main channel. Velocity measurements indicate that a critical inflow Froude number is associated with the initial formation stage of the front. Subsequent frontal locations and behaviour qualitatively correspond to the relative balance between tidal current and surface-layer buoyancy current speeds. Vertical profiling data and bed-mounted salinity sensors during a strong spring tide with low freshwater runoff demonstrate only minor surface stratification and layering on the flood. Nevertheless, the inflow Froude number exceeds unity at the Ridge at peak flood, which is indicative of up-creek frontal formation, and a strongly stratified plume propagates through the Ridge section on the ebb.",2023,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,,,,WOS:000921785700001,10.1007/s12237-022-01153-y,,#19763,Uncles 2023,,
1873,"Impacts of Seawater Rise on Seawater Intrusion in the Nile Delta Aquifer, Egypt","Sefelnasr, A; Sherif, M","Several investigations have recently considered the possible impacts of climate change and seawater level rise on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. All have revealed the severity of the problem and the significance of the landward movement of the dispersion zone under the condition of seawater level rise. Most of the studies did not consider the possible effects of the seawater rise on the inland movement of the shoreline and the associate changes in the boundary conditions at the seaside and the domain geometry. Such effects become more evident in flat, low land, coastal alluvial plans where large areas might be submerged with seawater under a relatively small increase in the seawater level. None of the studies combined the effect of increased groundwater pumping, due to the possible decline in precipitation and shortage in surface water resources, with the expected landward shift of the shore line. In this article, the possible effects of seawater level rise in the Mediterranean Sea on the seawater intrusion problem in the Nile Delta Aquifer are investigated using FEFLOW. The simulations are conducted in horizontal view while considering the effect of the shoreline landward shift using digital elevation models. In addition to the basic run (current conditions), six different scenarios are considered. Scenarios one, two, and three assume a 0.5 m seawater rise while the total pumping is reduced by 50%, maintained as per the current conditions and doubled, respectively. Scenarios four, five, and six assume a 1.0 m seawater rise and the total pumping is changed as in the first three scenarios. The shoreline is moved to account for the seawater rise and hence the study domain and the seaside boundary are modified accordingly. It is concluded that, large areas in the coastal zone of the Nile Delta will be submerged by seawater and the coast line will shift landward by several kilometers in the eastern and western sides of the Delta. Scenario six represents the worst case under which the volume of freshwater will be reduced to about 513 km(3) (billion m(3)).",2014,,GROUNDWATER,52,2,264-276,WOS:000347978200012,10.1111/gwat.12058,,#19766,Sefelnasr 2014,,

Stacking of siliciclastic facies in parasequences and parasequence sets provides data to evaluate oscillation of relative sea-level and subsidence on different temporal scales.The lowermost part of the passive margin prism is characterized by alluvial plain to shallow marine sediments deposited in incised valleys. The succeeding highstand period is recorded by ca. 250 in of progradational parasequence sets of predominantly rippled and horizontally laminated sandstones, representing stacked wave-dominated shoreline units in sequence 1, capped by a hiatus or, in some places, by a subaerial lava.As relative sea-level rose again, sand-rich barrier-beach complexes developed with microtidal lagoons and inlets, corresponding to a retrogradational parasequence set. This was followed by a highstand period, with aggradation and progradation of alluvial plain and coastal sediments grading up into wave-tide influenced shoreline deposits in sequence 2.In sequence 3, the succeeding mudstones represent tidal flat deposits in a back-barrier region. With continued transgression, the parasequences stacked retrogradationally, each flooding episode being recorded by increasingly deeper water deposits above low-angle cross-bedded sandstones of the swash zones. The succeeding highstand progradation is represented by alluvial plain deposits.The next transgressive systems tract, overlying an inferred erosional ravinement surface, is recorded by a retrogradational parasequence set dominated by low-angle cross-stratified swash zone deposits in sequence 4. The large-scale trough cross-bed sets in these parasequences represent sand shoals and sheets of the inner shelf system.The overall major transgression recorded in the lowermost part of the Palaeoproterozoic cratonic margin succession was related to first- to second-order sea-level changes, probably due to increasing regional thermal subsidence of the lithosphere following partial continental breakup. The stratigraphic evolution can be related to changes of relative sea-level with a frequency of ca. 25 million years, probably propagated by episodic thermal subsidence. The parasequences identified here are related to high-frequency cycles of relative sea-level change due to low-magnitude eustatic oscillations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1880,Effects of the Pearl River plume on the vertical structure of coastal currents in the Northern South China Sea during summer 2008,"Shu, YQ; Chen, J; Yao, JL; Pan, JY; Wang, WW; Mao, HB; Wang, DX","Analyses of moored current meter data from the South China Sea (SCS) Coastal Oceanographic Process Experiment Pilot Project (SCOPE-PP) reveal that strong spatial variation in the vertical structure of coastal currents in the northern SCS (NSCS) was caused by the interaction between the Pearl River plume (PRP) and the alongshore coastal jet. Observations indicate that the NSCS coastal current was generally eastward, spreading the PRP water eastward. The lighter brackish plume residing on the top of the saline, coastal water strengthened the stratification near the surface and blocked the downward momentum transport, resulting in a strong vertical shear of the velocity at the mooring site S205. Meanwhile, the plume water raised the sea level. Because of the geostrophic balance in the across-shore direction, the eastward coastal current in the upper layer strengthened on the onshore side (near S205) and weakened on the offshore side (near S206 and S305) due to the plume water intrusion. Therefore, the vertical shear of the velocity was enhanced at S205 and reduced at S206 and S305. Moreover, because the plume varied substantially with the wind, the vertical shear of the velocity responding to the wind was different between S205 and S206. The numerical simulation during summer 2008 confirms that the PRP enhances (weakens) the vertical shear of the velocity on the onshore (offshore) side by increasing (decreasing) the upper-layer current by about 0.2m s(-1) and decreasing (increasing) the middle-layer current slightly.",2014,,OCEAN DYNAMICS,64,12,1743-1752,WOS:000345086100003,10.1007/s10236-014-0779-5,,#19783,Shu 2014,,
1884,Numerical simulations of steady-state salinity distribution and submarine groundwater discharges in homogeneous anisotropic coastal aquifers,"Qu, WJ; Li, HL; Wan, L; Wang, XS; Jiang, XW","Steady-state seawater-groundwater interactions are simulated for homogeneous, anisotropic unconfined coastal aquifers using the two-dimensional numerical model MARUN. The spatial salinity distributions are approximately independent of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity K-x when alpha(L) root KxKz >= 10 (6) m(2)/s. Here K-z is vertical hydraulic conductivity and alpha(L) is longitudinal dispersivity. Both the fresh groundwater discharge rate Q(f) and seawater recirculation rate Q(s) depend linearly on K-x. These conclusions are validated by a semi-analytical method. The increase of anisotropy ratio pushes the saltwater wedge interface seaward and reduces Q(s). The increment of the longitudinal/transverse dispersivity ratio with fixed longitudinal dispersivity decreases the slope of isosalines and Q(s). When the seabed slope angle theta increases from 0.01 to pi/2, the freshwater-seawater interface moves landward. The increment of theta increases Q(s) slightly when theta < pi/4 and reduces Q(s) when theta > pi/4. The inland recharge rate Q(f) is independent of the seabed slope. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A habitat model, based on the temperature and salinity tolerance of the two species as well as their nutrient preferences, provides a good interpretation for the observed seasonal progression and spatial distribution of these taxa. It also points to climate-induced variability in the hydrological forcing as a mechanism driving the interannual shifts in the algal distributions: both P. minimum and K. veneficum shift downstream during wetter years but upstream during dry years. Climate downscaling simulations using the habitat model show upstream shifts of the two species in the estuary and longer blooming seasons by the mid-21st century. Salt intrusion due to sea level rise will raise salinity in the estuary and cause these HAB species to migrate upstream, but increasing winter-spring flows may also drive favorable salinity habitat downstream. Warming leads to longer growing seasons of P. minimum and K. veneficum but may suppress bloom habitat during their respective peak bloom periods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

1886,Salt intrusion in tidal wetlands: European willow species tolerate oligohaline conditions,"Markus-Michalczyk, H; Hanelt, D; Ludewig, K; Muller, D; Schroter, B; Jensen, K","Tidal wetlands experience salt intrusion due to the effects of climate change. This study clarifies that the European flood plain willows species Salix alba and Salix viminalis tolerate oligohaline conditions. Salix alba L and Salix viminalis L. are distributed on flood plains up to transitional waters of the oligohaline to the mesohaline estuarine stretch in temperate climates. They experience spatial and temporal variations in flooding and salinity. In the past, willows dominated the vegetation above the mean high water line, attenuated waves and contributed to sedimentation. In recent centuries, human utilization reduced willow stands. Today, the Elbe estuary - a model system for an estuary in temperate zones - exhibits increasing flooding and salinity due to man-induced effects and climatic changes. Willows were described as having no salinity tolerance. In contrast, our soil water salinity measurements at willows in tidal wetlands prove that mature Salix individuals tolerate oligohaline conditions. To assess immature plant salinity tolerance, we conducted a hydroponic greenhouse experiment. Vegetative propagules originating from a freshwater and an oligohaline site were treated in four salinities. Related to growth rates and biomass production, we found interspecific similarities and a salinity tolerance up to salinity 2. Vitality and chlorophyll fluorescence indicated an acclimation of Salix viminalis to oligohaline conditions. We conclude, that the survival of S. alba and S. viminalis and the restoration of willow stands in estuarine flood plains - with regard to wave attenuation and sedimentation - might be possible, despite increasing salinity in times of climate change.

1887,Linear sea-level response to abrupt ocean warming of major West Antarctic ice basin,"Mengel, M; Feldmann, J; Levermann, A","Antarctica's contribution to global sea-level rise has recently been increasing(1). Whether its ice discharge will become unstable and decouple from anthropogenic forcing(2-4) or increase linearly with the warming of the surrounding ocean is of fundamental importance(5). Under unabated greenhouse-gas emissions, ocean models indicate an abrupt intrusion of warm circumpolar deepwater into the cavity below West Antarctica's Filchner-Ronne ice shelf within the next two centuries(6,7). The ice basin's retrograde bed slope would allow for an unstable ice-sheet retreat(8), but the buttressing of the large ice shelf and the narrow glacier troughs tend to inhibit such instability(9-11). It is unclear whether future ice loss will be dominated by ice instability or anthropogenic forcing. Here we show in regional and continental-scale ice-sheet simulations, which are capable of resolving unstable grounding-line retreat, that the sea-level response of the Filchner-Ronne ice basin is not dominated by ice instability and follows the strength of the forcing quasi-linearly. We find that the ice loss reduces after each pulse of projected warm water intrusion. The long-term sea-level contribution is approximately proportional to the total shelf-ice melt. Although the local instabilities might dominate the ice loss for weak oceanic warming(12), we find that the upper limit of ice discharge from the region is determined by the forcing and not by the marine ice-sheet instability.",2016,,NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE,6,1,71-+,WOS:000367030800025,10.1038/NCLIMATE2808,,#19791,Mengel 2016,,

In 2014 food supply to the anchovy dramatically deteriorated compared with the initial period of the salinization (2006-2013). Small individuals dominant in the population exhibited extremely low lipid content, which appear to have led to a decrease in reproduction and, therefore, the stock decline in the subsequent years. As the population size decreased, the food supply improved; the lipid content in the anchovy body increased by 40-50% in 2015-2018. Fish of the older age groups became dominant in the population, which indirectly suggests a drop in recruitment and the population aging. The work discusses the impact of the change in the fish food resources on the anchovy food supply over the current period of the Sea of Azov salinization (2006-2018)",2020,,JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY,60,6,931-937,WOS:000605646300011,10.1134/S0032945220050124,,#19796,Yuneva 2020,,
1893,"THE FRESH-WATER-SALTWATER INTERFACE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE TURBIDITY MAXIMUM IN THE TAMAR ESTUARY, UNITED-KINGDOM","UNCLES, RJ; STEPHENS, JA","Data are presented from several experiments in the freshwater-saltwater interface (FSI) region of the Tamar Estuary. Longitudinal surveys of salinity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at high water showed that the location of the FSI could be predicted in terms of a power-law regression with freshwater runoff. Longitudinal transects also were surveyed over periods of several hours. The FSI was observed to advect into the region on the flood with strong vertical mixing. After high water, stratification became intense as fresher water ebbed in the surface layers. The near-bed water in the stratified region began to ebb between 2 h and 3 h before low water. A model of the vertical structure of longitudinal currents showed that the enhanced stratification on the ebb, coupled with the longitudinal density gradient, partly produced this long period of slack, near-bed currents following high water. A strong turbidity maximum (TM) occurred during spring tides and was located slightly up-estuary of the FSI at high water. Longitudinal transects during a period of low freshwater runoff and large neap tide showed that at the start of the flood the TM was associated with the FSI region. As the FSI advected up-estuary on the flood there was considerable resuspension of sediment at the FSI. Some of this SPM moved with the FSI and reached the limit of saline intrusion, where it formed a slowly-eroding TM as particles settled during the long, high-water slack period. As the near-bed currents increased on the ebb and the FSI moved down-estuary, strong vertical mixing and resuspension of recently deposited sediment occurred in the unstratified water behind the FSI and the associated TM advected down-estuary. Additional effects were present with stronger tides and increased runoff.",1993,,ESTUARIES,16,1,126-141,WOS:A1993LJ17500011,10.2307/1352770,,#19798,UNCLES 1993,,
1896,Soil seed banks and their germination responses to cadmium and salinity stresses in coastal wetlands affected by reclamation and urbanization based on indoor and outdoor experiments,"Bai, JH; Huang, LB; Gao, ZQ; Lu, QQ; Wang, JJ; Zhao, QQ","Indoor and outdoor seedling emergence experiments were conducted to thoroughly investigate germination patterns as affected by reclamation and urbanization, the ecological characteristics of soil seed banks, and their relationships with environmental factors in both urbanized and reclaimed regions of the Pearl River Delta in coastal wetlands. The germination rate of the soil seed bank was higher in the indoor experiment compared with that in the outdoor experiment, whereas the number and destiny of the germinated seedlings were greater in the outdoor experiment. The species diversity and number, as well as the richness and evenness indices, were higher in the urbanized region compared with the reclaimed region. However, the dominance and Sorensen similarity indices were greater in the reclaimed region compared with those indices in the urbanized region. Higher salinity and Cadmium (Cd) levels could inhibit seed germination; however, their suitable ranges (i.e. [0-2000 mg kg(-1)] for salinity and [0-4.0 mg kg(-1)] for available Cd) can activate seedling emergence, and more seedlings germinated under the intersectional levels at 0.34 mg kg(-1) available Cd and 778.6 mg kg(-1) salinity.

1899,Microbial Community Response to Seawater Amendment in Low-Salinity Tidal Sediments,"Edmonds, JW; Weston, NB; Joye, SB; Mou, XZ; Moran, MA","Rising sea levels and excessive water withdrawals upstream are making previously freshwater coastal ecosystems saline. Plant and animal responses to variation in the freshwater-saline interface have been well studied in the coastal zone; however, microbial community structure and functional response to seawater intrusion remains relatively unexplored. Here, we used molecular approaches to evaluate the response of the prokaryotic community to controlled changes in porewater salinity levels in freshwater sediments from the Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. This work is a companion to a previously published study describing results from an experiment using laboratory flow-through sediment core bioreactors to document biogeochemical changes as porewater salinity was increased from 0 to 10 over 35 days. As reported in Weston et al. (Biogeochemistry, 77:375-408, 62), porewater chemistry was monitored, and cores were sacrificed at 0, 9, 15, and 35 days, at which time we completed terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16S rRNA clone library analyses of sediment microbial communities. The biogeochemical study documented changes in mineralization pathways in response to artificial seawater additions, with a decline in methanogenesis, a transient increase in iron reduction, and finally a dominance of sulfate reduction. Here, we report that, despite these dramatic and significant changes in microbial activity at the biogeochemical level, no significant differences were found between microbial community composition of control vs. seawater-amended treatments for either Bacterial or Archaeal members. Further, taxa in the seawater-amended treatment community did not become more ""marine-like"" through time. Our experiment suggests that, as seawater intrudes into freshwater sediments, observed changes in metabolic activity and carbon mineralization on the time scale of weeks are driven more by shifts in gene expression and regulation than by changes in the composition of the microbial community.",2009,,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,58,3,558-568,WOS:000269928300012,10.1007/s00248-009-9556-2,,#19807,Edmonds 2009,,
1900,Mechanisms Controlling the Distribution of Net Water Transport in Estuarine Networks,"Wang, JY; Dijkstra, YM; Swart, HE","Net water transport (NWT) in estuaries is important for, for example, salt intrusion and sediment dynamics. While NWT is only determined by river runoff in single channels, in estuarine networks, it results from a complex interplay between tides and residual flows. This study aims to disentangle the various contributions of these physical drivers to NWT in estuarine networks and investigate the sensitivities of NWT to variable forcing conditions, interventions, and sea level rise (SLR). To this end, a processes-based perturbative network model is developed, which accounts for the vertical flow structure to resolve density-driven flow driven by a vertically uniform along-channel salinity gradient. Other identified drivers are river discharge and three tidal rectification processes: Stokes transport and its return flow, momentum advection, and velocity-depth asymmetry. The model is applied to the Yangtze Estuary. NWT due to tidal rectifications and density-driven flow can be comparable to river discharge. Specifically in the North Branch, the direction of NWT may differ from the direction of river discharge. Varying river discharge mainly affects NWT as tide-river interaction is weak and density-driven flow is shown to be insensitive to salt intrusion. Conversely, variations in tidal amplitude strongly affect NWT related to tidal rectification and density-driven flow. The deepening (narrowing) of one channel (Deep Waterway Project), affected the NWT mostly through the density-driven flow (advection). Furthermore, NWT distribution in the Yangtze is insensitive to SLR up to 2 m because the effects of SLR on transport due to different drivers compensate each other.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,1,,WOS:000751885800010,10.1029/2021JC017982,,#19809,Wang 2022,,
1903,Tidal intrusion within a mega delta: An unstructured grid modelling approach,"Bricheno, LM; Wolf, J; Islam, S","The finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM) has been applied to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal in order to simulate tidal hydrodynamics and freshwater flow in a complex river system. The delta region is data-poor in observations of both bathymetry and water level; making it a challenge for accurate hydrodynamic models be configured for and validated in this area. This is the first 3D baroclinic model covering the whole GBM delta from deep water beyond the shelf break to 250 km inland, the limit of tidal penetration.This paper examines what controls tidal penetration from the open coast into an intricate system of river channels. A modelling approach is used to improve understanding of the hydrodynamics of the GBM delta system. Tidal penetration is controlled by a combination of bathymetry, channel geometry, bottom friction, and river flow. The simulated tides must be validated before this delta model is used further to investigate baroclinic processes, river salinity and future change in this area. The performance of FVCOM tidal model configuration is evaluated at a range of sites in order to assess its ability to capture water levels which vary over both a tidal and seasonal cycle.FVCOM is seen to capture the leading tidal constituents well at coastal tide gauge stations, with small root-mean-squared errors of 10 cm on average. Inland, the model compares favourably with twice daily observed water levels at thirteen stations where it is able to capture both tidal and annual timescales in the estuarine system. When the river discharge is particularly strong, the tidal range can be reduced as the tide and river are in direct competition.The bathymetry is found to be the most influential control on water levels within the delta, though tidal penetration can be significantly affected by the model's bottom roughness, and the inclusion of large river discharge. We discuss the generic problem of implementing a model in a data-poor region and the challenge of validating a hydrodynamic model from the open coast to narrow river channels. (C) 2016 The Authors.

1905,From circumpolar deep water to the glacial meltwater plume on the eastern Amundsen Shelf,"Nakayama, Y; Schroder, M; Hellmer, HH","The melting of Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS) has increased since the 1990 s, which may have a large impact on ice sheet dynamics, sea-level rise, and changes in water mass properties of surrounding oceans. The reason for the PIIS melting is the relatively warm (similar to 1.2 degrees C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) that penetrates into the PIIS cavity through two submarine glacial troughs located on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf. In this study, we mainly analyze the hydrographic data obtained during ANTXXVI/3 in 2010 with the focus on pathways of the intruding CDW, PIIS melt rates, and the fate of glacial meltwater. We analyze the data by dividing CTD profiles into 6 groups according to intruding CDW properties and meltwater content. From this analysis, it is seen that CDW warmer than 1.23 degrees C (colder than 1.23 degrees C) intrudes via the eastern (central) trough. The temperature is controlled by the thickness of the intruding CDW layer. The eastern trough supports a denser CDW layer than the water mass in Pine Island Trough (PIT). The eastern intrusion is modified on the way into PIT through mixing with the lighter and colder CDW from the central trough. Using ocean transport and tracer transport calculations from the ice shelf front CTD section, the estimated melt rate in 2010 is similar to 30 m yr(-1), which is comparable to published values. From spatial distributions of meltwater content, meltwater flows along the bathymetry towards the west. When compared with earlier (2000) observations, a warmer and thicker CDW layer is observed in Pine Island Trough for the period 2007-2010, indicating a recent thickening of the CDW intrusion.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the pattern of salinity intrusion and the spatiotemporal distribution of rice cultivation in the winter-spring crops of 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2020 in coastal provinces of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Sentinel-1 (S-1) data were used to extract the spatial distribution information of six rice growth stages based on a rice age algorithm. The classification accuracy of rice crop growth stages was found to have an overall accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.80 (n = 373). For evaluating salinity intrusion effects, salinity isolines (4 g/L) were used to determine the percentage of rice areas affected. Results show that in the years observed to have severe salinity intrusion such as 2016 and 2020, a strong shift in planting calendar was identified to avoid salinity intrusion, with some areas being sown or transplanted 10-30 days earlier than normal planting. In addition, the lack of irrigation water and salinity intrusion limits rice cultivation in the dry season of coastal areas. Further analysis from the S-1 data confirms that the spatiotemporal distribution of rice cultivation is related to the change in government policy/recommendation affected by salinity intrusion. These findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using S-1 data to develop an operational rice crop adaptation framework on the delta scale.",2020,,REMOTE SENSING,12,19,,WOS:000587181400001,10.3390/rs12193196,,#19823,Hoang-Phi 2020,,
1918,Solute exchanges between multi-depth groundwater and surface water of climatically vulnerable Gangetic delta front aquifers of Sundarbans,"Das, K; Mishra, AK; Singh, A; Agrahari, S; Chakrabarti, R; Mukherjee, A","The coastal aquifers of Sundarbans, an UNESCO world biodiversity heritage site, are highly vulnerable due to changing climatic conditions, intensification and increasing frequency of extreme climate events and uncontrolled abstraction of groundwater. The exchange of solutes between hydraulically connective shallow and deep aquifers, the seawater intrusion and the role of growing population are poorly understood in the Sundarbans. This study aims to address the solute exchange (Cl-, Sr2+, and salinity) process between surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) at local to regional scale under variable hydraulic head conditions, where annual rainfall is declining and population density is increasing [population 573 (1991) to 819 (2011)/Km(2)]. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in combination with salinity and delta O-18 data was used to address the exchange of solutes between SW-GW in a hydraulic continuation. The results revealed that regionally, the Cl- concentration of Sundarbans shows an increasing trend (average 329-351 mg/L) with declining groundwater levels (similar to 3 m). Local, depth-dependent study depicting there is a predominant exchange of Sr2+ between shallow depth [D1: 14-25 and D2: 30-50 m below ground level (m bgl)] with seawater (Sr2+: 30-85 mu M), which is possibly absent at greater depths (D3:115 and D4: 333 m bgl). The recorded Sr 2+ content ranged from 25 to 102 and 16 to 78 mu M for shallow depth D1 and D2, respectively, whereas, the Sr2+ concentrations ranged from 1.4 to 6.8 and 1.2 to 5.7 mu M for D3 and D4, respectively. The ERT data showed progressively increasing resistivity with increasing depth, similar to high salinity and enriched delta O-18 at shallow depths and depleted delta O-18 with low salinity at higher depth reflects the continuous distribution of solutes, which is possibly a result of local downward migration of contaminated shallow brackish water within this physically disconnected zone.

1921,The influence of density fronts on sediment dynamics within river-to-sea estuarine transitional waters,"Duck, RW","The interaction of river-borne suspended and bedload sediments with marine-derived sediments is complicated by the sharply defined lateral and transverse water density gradients of frontal systems that characterise many estuaries worldwide. These features, often recognised at the water surface as linear bands of foam or flotsam, develop principally due to tidal intrusion, axial convergence, longitudinal shearing and flow separation. However, knowledge of the relationships of such features with bathymetry is still poorly developed. Not only do frontal systems impact upon intra-water column fine particulate transport by entrapment and compartmentalisation, they also exert a control on the distribution of bedforms and bottom sediment grain size distributions, thereby delimiting often closely juxtaposed, but differing bottom current velocity fields on the ebb and flood tidal phases. In consequence, fronts are now considered as ""sieves"" within the transitional river-to-sea, estuarine sediment transfer system; this perception has been reinforced by numerical study of lateral grain size sorting.",2010,,SEDIMENT DYNAMICS FOR A CHANGING FUTURE,337,,220-223,WOS:000309505900028,,,#19853,Duck 2010,,

The basin experienced continued accommodation development during the middle Eocene because of differential subsidence caused by the onset of early Eocene sea-floor spreading in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, faulting, salt movement, and different tectonic activity between the Sorvestsnaget Basin and Veslemoy high. During this time, the margin shows transformation from an initially high-relief margin to a progradation in the final stage. The early stage of progradation is characterized by the establishment of generally oblique clinoform shifts creating a flat shelf-edge trajectory that implies a gentle falling or stable relative sea level and low accommodation-to-sediment supply ratio (<1) in the topsets. During the early stage of basin development, the high-relief margin, narrow shelf, stable or falling relative sea level, seismicity, and presumably high sedimentation rate caused accumulation of thick and areally extensive deep-water fans. Seismicscale sandstone injections deform the fans.A fully prograding margin developed when the shelf-to-basin profile lowered, apparently because of increased subsidence of the northern part. This stage of the basin development is generally characterized by the presence of sigmoid clinoform shifts creating an ascending shelf-edge trajectory that is implying steady or rising relative sea level with an accommodation-to-sediment supply ratio of greater than 1, implying sand accumulation on the shelf. This study suggests that some volume of sand was transported into the deep water during relative sea level rise considering the narrow shelf and inferred high rates of sediment supply.",2014,,AAPG BULLETIN,98,3,515-544,WOS:000332912200005,10.1306/08221312208,,#19854,Safronova 2014,,

The data used in this study for calculating freshwater fraction and its transport volume were 45 conductivitytemperature-depth CTD casts and single moored ADCP current measurement, carried out between 17 and 25 May 2018. The budget of the box model system is calculated using evaporation and precipitation data.

A Case Study from San Jose Lagoon, Mexico","Imaz-Lamadrid, MA; Wurl, J; Ramos-Velazquez, E","In arid and semiarid zones, groundwater plays a key role in the ecology and availability of freshwater. Coastal lagoons in arid zones have great importance as a refuge for species of flora and fauna, as a source of freshwater, and for recreational purposes for local communities and tourism. In addition, as environments under natural stress, they are suffering pressure from anthropogenic activities and climate change, especially in zones with intense touristic development as in the case of the Baja California Peninsula in northwest Mexico. In this paper, we analyze the future of a coastal lagoon impacted by climate change and anthropogenic pressures. We constructed a groundwater MODFLOW-SWI2 model to predict changes in freshwater-saltwater inputs and correlated them with the geospatial analysis of the distribution and evolution of the water body and surrounding vegetation. The methodology was applied to the San Jose lagoon, one of the most important wetlands in the Baja California peninsula, which had been affected by anthropogenic activities and endangered by climate change. According to our water balance, the deficit of the San Jose aquifer will increase by 2040 as a result of climate change. The water table north of the lagoon will drop, affecting the amount of freshwater inflow. This reduction, together with an increase of evapotranspiration and the sea-level rise, will favor an increase of mineralization, reducing the surface water and groundwater quality and in consequence affecting the vegetation cover. Without proper management and adequate measures to mitigate these impacts, the lagoon may disappear as a freshwater ecosystem. Results of this research indicate that the use of a groundwater flow model, together with a geospatial analysis provide effective tools to predict scenarios for the future of coastal lagoons, and serve as a basis for land planning, nature conservation, and sustainable management of these ecosystems.",2019,,RESOURCES-BASEL,8,1,,WOS:000464072300001,10.3390/resources8010057,,#19873,Imaz-Lamadrid 2019,,

Pro-active resource management decisions are required; however, these efforts will prove futile unless reliable predictions can be made of the impact that changing conditions will impart upon the hydrologic cycle and water reserves. Groundwater is a particular concern as its unique characteristics are rarely adequately accommodated within IWRM (Integrated Water Resource Management). Moreover, few studies have considered the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in a region where meteorological conditions and sea and lake levels are expected to change at rates that are unprecedented in modern times. Time is of the essence. Groundwater is resilient to drought and promises to play a crucial role in regions where climate change threatens renewable water resources. Questions that need to be addressed are: (1) How will climate change affect the nature and seasonality of aquifer recharge? (2) How will fresh groundwater levels beneath coastal areas respond to changing sea/lake levels, and to what extent will rising sea levels promote the intrusion of seawater? (3) Will a decline in sea/lake levels accelerate the release of contaminants stored in coastal aquifers to receiving water bodies?

1933,Experimental evidence of chemical osmosis-driven improved oil recovery in low-salinity water flooding: Generation of osmotic pressure via oil-saturated sandstone,"Takeda, M; Manaka, M; Ito, D","Chemical osmosis caused by semipermeability and salinity gradient of reservoir rock has been considered to improve oil recovery obtained by low-salinity water flooding. However, the generation of osmotic pressure by rocks containing crude oil has not been reported. In this study, an oil-saturated sandstone generated osmotic pressures of up to 37 kPa at a salinity difference of 0.6-0.1 M NaCl and expelled crude oil from the surface facing low-salinity water (LSW). The results demonstrate that chemical osmosis can drive directional oil migration toward LSW on the scale of rock. The tested sandstone exhibited a clay content of 17 wt%; however, the oil-free core did not generate osmotic pressure. In contrast, the oil-saturated core generated osmotic pressures at the high-salinity water (HSW) facing its surface five days after being exposed to the salinity difference. The delayed pressure generation can be attributed both to the water intrusion into potential membranes (i.e., clay minerals, crude oil, and the interface between oil and minerals) and to the evolution of salinity gradient in the core. In the last experiment, on the same core using a salinity difference of 0.9-0.1 M NaCl, osmotic pressure developed immediately because both the active membranes and saline water already existed across the core. These results suggest that the potential semipermeability of reservoir rocks containing crude oil and saline water can promptly cause chemical osmosis upon exposure to the change in salinity difference. Although the cumulative flux driven by the osmotic pressure likely exceeded the volume of injected crude oil, chemical osmosis continued generating osmotic pressure until the end of the experiments. These contradictory results suggest that the chemical osmosisdriven directional oil migration toward the LSW occurs preferentially through conductive large-sized pores, and the residual oil in small-sized pores and clay minerals exert long-lasting semipermeability to cause chemical osmosis further toward the HSW.",2022,,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,215,,,WOS:000826200400005,10.1016/j.petrol.2022.110731,,#19884,Takeda 2022,,
1934,MANGROVES AND CLIMATE-CHANGE IN THE FLORIDA AND CARIBBEAN REGION - SCENARIOS AND HYPOTHESES,"SNEDAKER, SC","The principal scenario concerning the potential effects of climate change on mangrove forest communities revolves around sealevel rise with emphases on coastal abandonment and inland retreat attributable to flooding and saline intrusion. However, at the decade to century scale, changes in precipitation and catchment runoff may be a more significant factor at the regional level. Specifically, for any given sealevel elevation it is hypothesized that reduced rainfall and runoff would necessarily result in higher salinity and greater seawater-sulfate exposure. This would likely be associated with decreased production and increased sediment organic matter decomposition leading to subsidence. In contrast, higher rainfall and runoff would result in reduced salinity and exposure to sulfate, and also increase the delivery of terrigenous nutrients. Consequently, mangrove production would increase and sediment elevations would be maintained. Support for this scenario derives from studies of the high production in saline mangrove impoundments which are depleted in seawater sulfate.

1937,Climate change impacts on water resources in Guyana,"Narayan, K","With climate change and an expected consequent rise in sea level, salt water intrusion into rivers and possible adverse effects on aquifers is a major concern. Guyana is situated on the northeastern coast of South America, has an area of 215 000 km(2), and a population of about three quarters of a million people more than 90% of whom reside on a narrow coastal strip, less than 10 km from the ocean. The coastal strip is below high tide level of the Atlantic Ocean, is extremely flat, and is protected by a system of dykes that are constructed mainly of concrete and clay. A large number of large rivers flow south to north into the Atlantic Ocean. Water supply for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses is obtained from a combination of ground and surface water sources. In this paper, an attempt is made to analyse situations that Could arise as a result of sea level rise. A specific sea level rise of one metre by the end of the century and the impacts of this rise on water resources is investigated. The results indicate that the consequences for the surface water resources could be severe, but not as severe as for the groundwater resources.",2006,,CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE - HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS,308,,413-+,WOS:000249093700069,,,#19890,Narayan 2006,,

The volume of the eruption could not be precisely determined, although comparison of pre- and post-eruption SeaBeam bathymetry indicate that any changes in ridge crest morphology resulting from the eruption were < 10 m high.Effects of the eruption included: (1) increased abundance and redistribution of hydrothermal vents, disappearance of numerous vent communities, and changes in characteristics of vent fauna and mineral deposits within the eruption area since December, 1989; (2) murkiness of bottom waters up to tens of meters above the seafloor due to high densities of suspended mineral and biogenic particulates; (3) destruction of a vent community by lava flows, mass wasting, and possible hydrovolcanic explosion at a site known as 'Tubeworm Barbecue' in the axial summit caldera (ASC) at 9-degrees-50.6'N; (4) near-critical temperatures of hydrothermal vent fluids, ranging up to 403-degrees-C; (5) temporal variations over a 2 week interval in both temperatures and chemical/isotopic compositions of hydrothermal fluids; (6) unusual compositions of end-member vent fluids, with pH values ranging to a record low of 2.5, salinities ranging as low as 0.3 wt% NaCl (one-twelfth that of seawater), and dissolved gases reaching high concentrations (> 65 mmol/l for both CO2 and H2S); (7) venting at temperatures above 380-degrees-C of visually detectable white vapor that transformed to plumes of gray smoke a few centimeters above vent orifices; (8) disorganized venting of both high-temperature fluids (black and gray smoke) and large volumes of cooler, diffuse hydrothermal fluids directly from the basaltic seafloor, rather than from hydrothermal mineral constructions; (9) rapid and extensive growth of flocculent white bacterial mats (species unknown) on and under the seafloor in areas experiencing widespread venting of diffuse hydrothermal fluid: and (10) subseafloor downslope migration of magma normal to the ridge axis in a network of small-scale (1-5 m diameter) lava tubes and channels to distances at least 100-200 m outside the ASC.We suggest that, in April, 1991, intrusion of dikes in the eruption area to < 200 m beneath the ASC floor resulted in phase separation of fluids near the tops of the dikes and a large flux of vapor-rich hydrothermal fluids through the overlying rubbly, cavernous lavas. Low salinities and gas-rich compositions of hydrothermal fluids sampled in the eruption area are appropriate for a vapor phase in a seawater system undergoing subcritical liquid-vapor phase separation (boiling) and phase segregation. Hydrothermal fluids streamed directly from fissures and pits that may have been loci of lava drainback and/or hydrovolcanic explosions. These fissures and pits were lined with white mats of a unique fast-growing bacteria that was the only life associated with the brand-new vents. The prolific bacteria, which covered thousands of square meters on the ridge crest and were also abundant in subseafloor voids, may thrive on high levels of gases in the vapor-rich hydrothermal fluids initially escaping the hydrothermal system. White bacterial particulates swept from the seafloor by hydrothermal vents swirled in an unprecedented biogenic 'blizzard' up to 50 m above the bottom. The bacterial proliferation of April, 1991 is likely to be a transient bloom that will be checked quickly either by decline of dissolved gas concentrations in the fluids as rapid heat loss brings about cessation of boiling, and/or by grazing as other organisms are re-established in the biologically devastated area.",1993,,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,119,1-2,85-101,WOS:A1993LV59500007,10.1016/0012-821X(93)90008-W,,#19892,HAYMON 1993,,
1941,Numerical study of tidal effects on seawater intrusion in confined and unconfined aquifers by time-independent finite-difference method,"Chen, BF; Hsu, SM","This Study presents a two-dimensional time-independent finite difference model to simulate tidal effects on the intrusion of seawater in either a confined or phreatic aquifer. The model considers a sloped beach face. The irregular beach face and varying ground water surface are mapped to a square domain and the time dependence of the moving boundary is removed by an appropriate coordinate transformation. The finite-difference expression of the governing equations is, therefore, written in a time-independent mesh system, and a time-independent finite difference scheme is established. The numerical technique is confirmed by the reported results of the traditional Henry's and modified Henry's problems. Idealized saltwater intrusion, known as Henry's problem, was extended to simulate seawater intrusion on sloped beach faces accounting for tidal effects. Tidal effects enhance the migration of seawater. The dominant feature of a confined aquifer is that seawater intrudes inland during the flood tide. The saltwater continues to intrude further inland and reaches its furthest upstream position at ebb tide. In an unconfined aquifer, the tidal fluctuation causes the variation of the intrusion profile in the vertical direction only. The fluctuation of the water table oscillates according with the fluctuating tide with a time lag, but the influence of the tide is damped out with horizontal distance from the beach. The variation of the distance through which the seawater intrudes also oscillates with the tide. with a constant time lag of 0.25T, where T is the tidal period. The shape of the aquifer also affects the intrusion of saltwater and the velocity of intrusion. The rate of seawater intrusion and the distance through which the seawater intrudes increases with the slope of the bank.",2004,,JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING-ASCE,130,4,191-206,WOS:000222221700005,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(2004)130:4(191),,#19896,Chen 2004,,

The food supply was assessed based on the lipids and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic) accumulated in the body of the anchovy at the end of the feeding stage (October-November). As salinization of the sea progressed, the level of the total lipids in the anchovy body increased from 15.5 to 18-18.7% owing to triacylglycerol content; absolute amounts of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids grew 1.9 and 2.6 times respectively (from 576 to 1091 and from 594 to 1540 mg/100 g of wet weight). Along with this, anchovy stock increased multifold, which equally indicates a significant improvement in food supply of the fish. Qualitative composition of the anchovy diet was found to shift towards the dominance of the Black Sea migrants and an increased share of the animal-source food in the intake. In addition, we discuss the correlation between the interannual variability in food supply of the anchovy in 2006-2013 and stock of its main trophic competitors in the Sea of Azov, namely, tyulka Clupeonella delicatula delicatula and ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi.",2019,,JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY,59,1,104-112,WOS:000467112800011,10.1134/S003294521901017X,,#19899,Yuneva 2019,,

To clarify the mechanism of secondary salinization, studies on water and salt behavior were conducted in an irrigation block where a rice-based cropping system has been practiced. Results of on-site studies are summarized as follows: (1) since the performance of land-leveling for rice cultivation was extremely poor, the water level was maintained high enough to submerge the highest portion of each plot, and this causes wastage of irrigation water and salt accumulation. (2) A large portion of water introduced to rice plots tends to be released into field drains. (3) Due to excessive irrigation of rice plots with slightly saline river water, dissolved salts were mainly deposited in upland plots in the block and its periphery. Changes in salt accumulation rates were dependent upon the scale of annual changes in the farmland areas that were converted from the upland condition to submerged condition in a process of crop rotation. (4) A remarkable finding was obtained on salt behavior in saturated shallow soil layers of rice plots. An initial decrease in soil water salinity in the shallow layer is due to the leaching effects of infiltration during the initial stage, and the subsequent gradual increase is more likely a consequence of mixing with the saline water that remains in the finer soil pores combined with the concentration effects of crop water uptake, and the upward flow from the lower layers due to occasional interruption and resumption of irrigation water supply. (5) Because seepage water from rice plots flows underneath the field drain, the rise of the groundwater table and salt accumulation were accelerated in the adjacent upland plots. Thus, mixed cropping with rice and upland crops based on a crop rotation system in an irrigation block accelerates waterlogging and salt accumulation in upland plots. Based on these results, several remedial measures were recommended to overcome problems on secondary salinization as follows: (1) avoid mixed cropping with rice and upland crops, and unify either upland crops or rice in an irrigation block to control groundwater table; (2) decrease conveyance and field application losses through improved canal construction and management performance, introduction of canal lining, and improved land-leveling performance; (3) maintain and operate drainage canals to enhance function, particularly installation of subsurface tile drainage for enhancing subsurface drainage function and management of drainage outfall for minimizing environmental degradation caused by saline drainage water in the downstream area; (4) develop a design and management technique of evaporation pond for better effluent management and reuse of drainage water at the outfall of each irrigation block; (5) reduce the water supplied for rice and its use for other crops, or returning the saved water to the river for downstream users including returning to the environment; (6) conclude international water and/or drainage rights agreements among riparian countries and enactment of a basin-wide management regulation to control water withdrawal and drainage.

Frequent floods, cyclones contaminate the surface water and the groundwater is contaminated by the saline water. The groundwater quality is mostly Na-Cl type and there is various degree of intermixing. Seven aquifer systems have been delineated, which are contaminated with the sea water from different directions and the saline-fresh water interface is under a delicate balance. Lack of awareness, poor hydrogeological understanding has enhanced the complexity of the situation.

Many researchers have conducted theoretical, experimental, and numerical analyses on the effects of changes in seawater and groundwater levels on coastal aquifers. In this study, modeling experiments were conducted in a sandy tank to analyze revetment and underground obstacles that influence seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. We focused on areas that have not been examined by current research. We confirmed that as the gradient of the seawater level to groundwater level increased, seawater intrusion weakened, because the difference between the seawater and groundwater levels increased as the salinity difference between the seawater and freshwater decreased. Following the installation of a revetment in the experimental coastal aquifer, the groundwater level behind it increased. Due to a decrease in the cross-sectional area, a special seawater-freshwater interface formed. We found that the seawater-groundwater pressure gradient increased due to the revetment, the flow to the sea increased, and the seawater-freshwater boundary moved in the direction of the sea in the experimental tank. This study suggests that if revetment and similar underground obstacles are arranged appropriately, the groundwater level and groundwater flow can be changed, and seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers can be reduced. In the future, results from this experiment could be used by numerical models as verification data for the seawater-freshwater interface and the seawater intrusion distance.",2018,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,441-445,WOS:000441173100089,10.2112/SI85-089.1,,#19911,Lee 2018,,

Estuarine waters at the interface of marine and freshwater bodies are among the most volatile ecosystems, particularly for aquatic species, and will be strongly influenced by the temperature with extreme flooding events. This study aimed to quantify the acclimation capacity of coastal fish species to estuarine plume modifications. The thicklip mullet (Chelon labrosus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were selected as representative species of estuarine ecological guilds. These fish were subjected to an experiment mimicking a brief freshwater intrusion (35-5). These experiments were conducted at two different temperatures that these two species would encounter during their incursion from the sea through estuarine waters to freshwater habitats. The experimental results confirmed the high capacity for acclimation of both species to changes in salinity and temperature. Interspecific differences were observed. For example, the salinity has a greater effect on the metabolism of the seabass than on that of the mullets. Meanwhile, the temperature has a greater effect on the mullets. These differences in metabolic responses to fluctuating salinities and temperatures may modify the use of estuarine waters by these species and should be considered when predicting future specific distribution areas in the context of global change.

1951,Layered seawater intrusion and melt under grounded ice,"Robel, AA; Wilson, E; Seroussi, H","Increasing melt of ice sheets at their floating or vertical interfaces with the ocean is a major driver of marine ice sheet retreat and sea level rise. However, the extent to which warm, salty seawater may drive melting under the grounded portions of ice sheets is still not well understood. Previous work has explored the possibility that dense seawater intrudes beneath relatively light subglacial freshwater discharge, similar to the ""salt wedge"" observed in many estuarine systems. In this study, we develop a generalized theory of layered seawater intrusion under grounded ice, including where subglacial hydrology occurs as a macroporous water sheet over impermeable beds or as microporous Darcy flow through permeable till. Using predictions from this theory, we show that seawater intrusion over flat or reverse-sloping impermeable beds may feasibly occur up to tens of kilometers upstream of a glacier terminus or grounding line. On the other hand, seawater is unlikely to intrude more than tens of meters through permeable till. Simulations using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) show that even just a few hundred meters of basal melt caused by seawater intrusion upstream of marine ice sheet grounding lines can cause projections of marine ice sheet volume loss to be 10 %-50 % higher. Kilometers of intrusion-induced basal melt can cause projected ice sheet volume loss to more than double. These results suggest that further observational, experimental and numerical investigations are needed to determine the conditions under which seawater intrusion occurs and whether it will indeed drive rapid marine ice sheet retreat and sea level rise in the future.",2022,,CRYOSPHERE,16,2,451-469,WOS:000758046500001,10.5194/tc-16-451-2022,,#19921,Robel 2022,,
1952,Quantifying a Sustainable Management Space for Human Use of Coastal Groundwater under Multiple Change Pressures,"Mazi, K; Koussis, AD; Destouni, G","In the densely populated coastal regions of the world, loss of groundwater due to seawater intrusion, driven by changes of climate, sea level, land use and water use, may critically impact many people. We analytically investigate and quantify the limits constraining a coastal aquifer's sustainable management space, in order to avoid critical loss of the coastal groundwater resource by seawater intrusion. Limiting conditions occur when the intrusion toe reaches the pumping wells, well intrusion, or the marine-side groundwater divide, complete intrusion; in both cases the limits are functions of the seaward groundwater flow remaining after the human groundwater extractions. The study presents a screening-level approach to the quantification of the key natural and human-determined controls and sustainability limits for the human use of coastal groundwater. The physical and geometrical characteristics of the coastal aquifer along with the natural conditions for recharge and replenishment of the coastal groundwater are the key natural controls of the sustainable management space for the latter. The groundwater pumping rates and locations are the key human-determined controls of this space. The present approach to combining and accounting for both of these types of controls is simple, yet general. The approach is applicable across different scales and regions, and for historic, current and projected future conditions of changing hydro-climate, sea level, and human freshwater use. The use of this approach is also concretely demonstrated for the natural and human-determined controls and limits of the sustainable management space for two specific Mediterranean aquifers.",2016,,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,30,12,4063-4080,WOS:000381377700002,10.1007/s11269-016-1363-1,,#19922,Mazi 2016,,
1953,A three-dimensional palaeohydrogeological reconstruction of the groundwater salinity distribution in the Nile Delta Aquifer,"van Engelen, J; Verkaik, J; King, JD; Nofal, ER; Bierkens, MFP; Essink, GHPO","Holocene marine transgressions are often put forward to explain observed groundwater salinities that extend far inland in deltas. This hypothesis was also proposed in the literature to explain the large land-inward extent of saline groundwater in the Nile Delta. The groundwater models previously built for the area used very large dispersivities to reconstruct this saline and brackish groundwater zone. However, this approach cannot explain the observed freshening of this zone. Here, we investigated the physical plausibility of the Holocene-transgression hypothesis to explain observed salinities by conducting a palaeohydrogeological reconstruction of groundwater salinity for the last 32 ka with a complex 3-D variable-density groundwater flow model, using a state-of-the-art version of the SEAWAT computer code that allows for parallel computation. Several scenarios with different lithologies and hypersaline groundwater provenances were simulated, of which five were selected that showed the best match with the observations. Amongst these selections, total freshwater volumes varied strongly, ranging from 1526 to 2659 km(3), mainly due to uncertainties in the lithology offshore and at larger depths. This range is smaller (1511-1989 km(3)) when we only consider the volumes of onshore fresh groundwater within 300m depth. In all five selected scenarios the total volume of hypersaline groundwater exceeded that of seawater. We also show that during the last 32 ka, total freshwater volumes significantly declined, with a factor ranging from 2 to 5, due to the rising sea level. Furthermore, the time period required to reach a steady state under current boundary conditions exceeded 5.5 ka for all scenarios. Finally, under highly permeable conditions the marine transgression simulated with the palaeohydrogeological reconstruction led to a steeper fresh-salt interface compared to its steady-state equivalent, while low-permeable clay layers allowed for the preservation of fresh groundwater volumes. This shows that long-term transient simulations are needed when estimating present-day fresh-salt groundwater distributions in large deltas. The insights of this study are also applicable to other major deltaic areas, since many also experienced a Holocene marine transgression.",2019,,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,23,12,5175-5198,WOS:000503460500002,10.5194/hess-23-5175-2019,,#19923,vanEngelen 2019,,

A variable pressure on the seabed due to propagation of long gravity waves (LGWs) gives rise to variations in pore pressure gradient followed by groundwater filtration in pores and channels of porous rocks. These processes result in the generation of telluric electric currents in water-saturated porous rock of the seashore due to electrokinetic effect. In the model a displacement of the sea surface in LGWs is described in the ""shallow water"" approximation. A set of basic equations describing rock strain and electrokinetic effect is solved in quasi-static approximation. The telluric electric field in the porous rocks of coastal zone are found as a function of depth and distance to the coastline at different frequencies of LGWs.

Over the last decade we have witnessed many attempts to enhance the climate robustness of agriculture, urban development, water systems, and nature to an increase in flood and drought risks due to a higher variability in rainfall patterns and sea level rise. In the vulnerable Dutch delta, regional authorities have developed adaptation measures that deal with flood risk, the availability of fresh water, subsidence, and salt water intrusion. In view of all the uncertainties that surround climate change, scientists emphasize that it should be possible to make changes when conditions change or insights evolve. The concept of adaptive governance has been introduced to facilitate the process of climate adaptation. Adaptive governance requires the availability of governance arrangements that facilitate adaptiveness by being flexible to enable adjustment. Although flexible arrangements for adaptation to climate change make sense from an adaptive governance perspective, from a more bureaucratic, political, and legal perspective, there might be good reasons to make arrangements as solid and robust as possible. In this article we answer the question to what extent the arrangements used to implement various adaptation measures are really adaptive and what mechanisms play a role in obstructing the accomplishment of adaptive arrangements. By analyzing and comparing nine adaptation cases, dealing with different climate issues, and the arrangements used to implement them from both a governance and a legal perspective, we are able to get more detailed insight into the main characteristics of the selected arrangements, their degree of adaptiveness, and the main hampering mechanisms for the creation or functioning of adaptive arrangements.",2015,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,20,4,,WOS:000367628900003,10.5751/ES-07704-200411,,#19934,vanBuuren 2015,,

These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast's coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches-GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQI(SWI), total hardness, water quality index (WQI)-and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQI(SWI) classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand's TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQI(SWI) analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer's coverage falls under the ""moderately hard"" category.

In this study, for the first time, we derive an explicit analytical solution for the timescales of SWI and seawater retreat (SWR) in a confined, homogeneous coastal aquifer system under the quasi-steady assumption, based on a classical sharp-interface solution for approximating freshwater outflow rates into the sea. The flow continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface are identified as two primary mechanisms governing timescales of the interface movement driven by an abrupt change in discharge rates or hydraulic heads at the inland boundary. Through theoretical analysis, we quantified the dependence of interface-movement timescales on porosity, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, aquifer length, density ratio, and boundary conditions. Predictions from the analytical solution closely agreed with those from numerical simulations. In addition, we define a temporal asymmetry index ( the ratio of the SWI timescale to the SWR timescale) to represent the resilience of the coastal aquifer in response to SWI. The developed analytical solutions provide a simple tool for the quick assessment of SWI and SWR timescales and reveal that the temporal asymmetry between SWI and SWR mainly relies on the initial and final values of the freshwater flux at the inland boundary, and is weakly affected by aquifer parameters.

1971,"Quasi-estuary processes and consequences for human activity, south Baltic","Cieslinski, R; Drwal, J","(O)n the coasts of inland half-open seas, such as the Baltic, there is observed a phenomenon of periodic intrusions of sea waters into land waters. They are caused by a current meteorological and hydrological situation and not by tides. However, due to the similarity of the processes of water exchange and the results brought about by them in the geographical environment, they are described as quasi-estuary processes. The course, scope and results of the phenomenon depend on the hydrography of the coast. In order to illustrate this dependency there were chosen four characteristic hydrographic situations which occur on the coast of the southern Baltic. These are: a deltaic system, a cut off distributary arm of a big European river, a system in which the mouth section of a river connects a large coastal lake with an open sea, and marshes. The consequence of the occurrence of the phenomenon of quasi-estuary is such problems which must be taken into consideration in the use of the geographical environment of the southern Baltic coast. This necessity becomes especially vital with the prospect of a rising of sea levels related to global climatic changes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

To study the recent changes in AABW, we have analyzed the in situ observations collected from Indian Ocean expeditions to the Southern Ocean during 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018, and 2020. A comprehensive analysis of these observations indicated recent freshening, warming, and contraction in the layer thickness of the AABW. Even though the AABW depicted inter-annual variability, it changed to moderately fresher and lighter water mass at the end of the recent decade. The characteristics of AABW exhibited a contraction in its layer thickness (similar to 50-120 m) during recent years. The water mass showed its freshening (similar to 0.002) and warming (similar to 0.04 degrees C) tendency from 2018 to 2020. The recent warming (similar to 0.3 degrees C) of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) near the Prydz Bay suggests enhanced melting of ice shelves. It is hypothesized that the combined influences of onshore intrusion of warm CDW, upper ocean warming, sea ice decline, wind forcing, polynya, and calving events possibly caused the freshening and reduction in the thickness of AABW. The continued changes in the ocean-atmospheric environmental conditions and the subsequent changes in the bottom water characteristics likely influence the global climate, overturning circulation, and the biogeochemical cycle.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000726183600001,10.3389/fmars.2021.730630,,#19960,Anilkumar 2021,,

Globally, rising sea levels, storms and diminishing sand supplies threaten beaches and the recreational, ecosystem, groundwater and flood protection services they provide. Consequently, beach nourishment practices have evolved from focusing on maximizing the time sand stays on the beach to also encompassing human safety and water recreation, groundwater dynamics and ecosystem impacts. In this Perspective, we present a multidisciplinary overview of beach nourishment, discussing physical aspects of beach nourishment alongside ecological and socio-economic impacts. The future of beach nourishment practices will vary depending on local vulnerability, sand availability, financial resources, government regulations and efficiencies, and societal perceptions of environmental risk, recreational uses, ecological conservation and social justice. We recommend co-located, multidisciplinary research studies on the combined impacts of nourishments, and explorations of various designs to guide these globally diverse nourishment practices.Beach nourishment is a well-established engineering practice to slow erosion and maintain or expand sandy beaches, but sea level rise, diminishing sand resources and recreational, groundwater and ecological concerns require new assessments and designs of this coastal management technique.

Models are routinely used to predict hydrodynamic and water quality conditions in estuaries, and presented here is a modeling approach that ultimately could prove helpful in designing strategies to divert fresh water while mitigating changes in salinity further downstream. An optimization problem is formulated whereby a least-squares function of the salinity distribution predicted by the model is minimized by optimizing a parameter vector describing the diversion rate as a function of time. The optimization method is shown to rapidly identify diversion schedules in a range of test systems. Optimization is performed by a quasi-Newton method that utilizes a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno update, and an adjoint sensitivity method is formulated and applied to evaluate the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameter vector. The sensitivity of salinity levels to diversion rates is predicted to have both intratidal and intertidal variability, giving insight into the potential for diversions at any given time and any location along an estuary to have either a rapid or longer-term effect on the salinity distribution. The controllability of salinity levels by fresh-water diversions is directly related to these sensitivities.",2002,,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,128,1,64-77,WOS:000173366700007,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2002)128:1(64),,#19969,Sanders 2002,,
1978,"Salt intrusion adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural development under climate change effects: A case of Ca Mau Peninsula, Vietnam","Nhung, TT; Vo, PV; Nghi, VV; Bang, HQ","Purpose: The Ca Mau Peninsula, a sub-region of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, plays an extremely important and decisive role in the country's food security. Due to the influence of complex hydrological regime, annual intrusion of sea water in the dry season has caused barriers and constraints for existing agricultural practices. However, the projection of saline simulation indicated that the occurrence of salt intrusion is likely further inland and severe intensity in the Hau River and coastal areas of the Ca Mau Peninsula in line with the rise of sea levels under climate change effects. This paper aims to propose mitigation and adaptation measures of salt tolerance for sustainable agricultural development in the Ca Mau Peninsula up to 2030 in accordance with projected scenarios of sea level rise.Methodology: The study inherited the results of forecasting salt intrusion in scenarios of sea level rise until 2030 by using the MIKE 11 HD-AD model in a previous research of the authors, in order to suggest mitigation and adaptation measures against salt intrusion for agricultural activities in the Ca Mau Peninsula. The documents relating to salt tolerance of crops, state of irrigation structures and land use were also collected and analyzed to provide more information for better proposed solutions.Findings: The paper presents some feasible measures to mitigate and adapt salt intrusion as sea level rise under impacts of climate change including appropriate land use planning; reasonable shifts in agricultural practices, in particular in the selection of plants and crops which can be tolerant to various salt limits; applying advanced cultivation techniques such as less water irrigation practices of alternate wetting and drying and salt tolerance enhancement; and hard-engineered structures for salt prevention and freshwater conveyance in freshwater-scarce areas.Practical implications: The study will be very meaningful for local farmers in the Ca Mau Peninsula to develop agriculture sustainably, especially, the famers can select crops which are suitable with the salt concentrations or change land use and cultivation models for higher yields.Social implications: The measures proposed in this study will help to increase the efficiency of agricultural production toward a sustainable agriculture-based economy, which will bring sustainable livelihoods for farmers in the peninsula where agriculture and aquaculture are their main economic activities.Originality/value: Until now, mitigation and adaptation measures of salt intrusion in the Ca Mau Peninsula have not been perfected.

In partially mixed and highly stratified mixed estuaries, the structure of stratified flow is complicated by density gradient and tidal reciprocating flow. The velocity and salinity structures have been experimentally studied in a flume which is 167.8 m long, 0.5 m wide, and 0.5 m deep. The processes of the tidal levels, the flood and ebb current, and the salt-fresh water mixing have been simulated. Furthermore, the partially mixed and highly stratified mixed types have been repeatability showed in the flume, by solving the problems of experiment control and saltwater recycling. The control variable method has been used to dialectically analyze the influence of tidal range and runoff volume on the velocity and salinity distribution. The tide and runoff are respectively considered to affect the mixing type in two contradictory ways. In the condition of tidal reciprocating flow, the periodical change of interface stability has been investigated. It is considered that the interface stability is closely related to the vertical gradient of density and velocity. As a result, the critical value of interface stabilization has been presented. The experimental data and research results can be used for the basic study of estuarine dynamics and applied to practical problems such as estuarine saltwater intrusion.",2019,,WATER,11,3,,WOS:000464546700003,10.3390/w11030584,,#19972,Xia 2019,,

A detailed seismostratigraphic assessment of the volcano-sedimentary package of the RGR was conducted in its western portion based on correlations between seismic data and DSDP Site 516F. The approximately 330-km long seismic transect is characterized by a complex array of normal faults related to extensional tectonics from Late Cretaceous to the Miocene, and probably into the present-day, along the Cruzeiro do Sul Rift. The bathymetric and seismic data reveal: a) the presence of deep faults that rise from the basement to the sea floor; b) the occurrence of several seamounts with tops at a water depth below 1000 m; and c) prominent graben structures that represent unidentified volcanic intrusions, indicative of the reactivation of Lower Miocene faults by younger extensional events. Based on integration of older data with the results presented here, we propose a five-stage tectono-sedimentary model for the western portion of the RGR: 1) the first basaltic flow began to form the Rio Grande Rise in the Coniacian/Santonian; 2) extensional movements caused lifting during the uplift of the large volcanic structures; 3) volcanic islands emerged above sea level increasing the deposition of volcanic breccia and ash layers; 4) after the volcanism ceased, thermal subsidence took place over the entire rise with intense erosion and sedimentation; and 5) the uppermost sedimentary layers were deposited in pelagic conditions and offset by sub-vertical normal faults.",2019,,MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY,110,,335-346,WOS:000498747500021,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.07.035,,#19977,Praxedes 2019,,
1992,Groundwater salinization and freshening processes in coastal aquifers from southwest Bangladesh,"Sarker, MMR; Van Camp, M; Hossain, D; Islam, M; Ahmed, N; Karim, MM; Bhuiyan, MAQ; Walraevens, K","The hydrogeochemical processes in the multilayer aquifers of southwest (SW) coastal area of Bangladesh provide important information for quantifying hydrochemical differences between different aquifers. Hydrogeochemical processes affecting groundwater chemistry in this coastal area have been evaluated by interpreting conventional plots, ionic delta, HFE-diagram, stable isotopes and geochemical modelling. The median TDS distribution of the aquifers has an increasing trend from below 1000 mg/l in the deep aquifer (DA) to 2622 mg/l in lower shallow aquifer (LSA) and 7012 mg/l in upper shallow aquifer (USA). Na+ is the dominant cation in all the aquifers. HCO3- is the dominant anion in DA with high median concentration (495 mg/l), which is more than double than that in LSA (214 mg/l) and USA (159 mg/l). The groundwater in the DA is freshened NaHCO3+ type due to cation exchange process that enhances second stage of calcite dissolution. Few NaCl+ type DA waters found in the SW corner of the study area indicate the presence of connate water confined in the inter-basin during the Holocene transgression. The stable isotopes indicate that the DA waters have been deposited during warmer periods. In contrast, both the LSA and USA are dominated by NaCl- type water; some CaCl- type waters have also been found in these aquifers, indicating salinization. The salinization processes consist of infiltration of redissolved evaporite salts, reverse cation exchange, and mixing with marine influenced flood water. Thus, the knowledge of different processes controlling freshening and salinization will help properly manage and preserve the environmental characteristics in the aquifer systems of SW Bangladesh as well as similar complex coastal geological settings.

1994,"Upriver transport of dissolved substances in an estuary and sub-estuary system of the lower James River, Chesapeake Bay","Hong, B; Shen, J; Xu, HZ","The water exchange between the James River and the Elizabeth River, an estuary and sub-estuary system in the lower Chesapeake Bay, was investigated using a 3D numerical model. The conservative passive tracers were used to represent the dissolved substances (DS) discharged from the Elizabeth River. The approach enabled us to diagnose the underlying physical processes that control the expansion of the DS, which is representative of potential transport of harmful algae blooms, pollutants from the Elizabeth River to the James River without explicitly simulating biological processes. Model simulations with realistic forcings in 2005, together with a series of processoriented numerical experiments, were conducted to explore the correlations of the transport process and external forcing. Model results show that the upriver transport depends highly on the freshwater discharge on a seasonal scale and maximum upriver transport occurs in summer with a mean transport time ranging from 15-30 days. The southerly/easterly wind, low river discharge, and neap tidal condition all act to strengthen the upriver transport. On the other hand, the northerly/westerly wind, river pulse, water level pulse, and spring tidal condition act to inhibit the upriver transport. Tidal flushing plays an important role in transporting the DS during spring tide, which shortens the travel time in the lower James River. The multivariable regression analysis of volume mean subtidal DS concentration in the mesohaline portion of the James River indicates that DS concentration in the upriver area can be explained and well predicted by the physical forcings (r = 0.858, p = 0.00001).",2018,,FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE,12,3,583-599,WOS:000444389400011,10.1007/s11707-017-0684-6,,#20001,Hong 2018,,

Yet, little is known about the salinity effect on full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) performance and on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). This study aimed at quantifying the N2O emissions of a full-scale biological aerated filter (BAF) and to correlate the dynamic behavior of the emissions with the process conditions and the periods of infiltration of seawater. A full-scale BAF was monitored for 3 months to assess both their gaseous and liquid N2O fluxes. The total average daily N2O emissions of the plant were 6.16 g N-N2O/kg of NH4-N removed. For the first time at full-scale, a correlation between the N2O emissions and the wastewater influent conductivity (salinity) was found, in which the increase in seawater infiltration in the sewer at high tide augments the daily N2O production and emission to 13.78 g N-N2O/kg of NH4-N removed. The proportional increase in influent conductivity and the N2O emission factor in this WWTP suggested that periods of high conductivity could serve as an indicator of increased N2O emissions by the plant. Furthermore, the operational conditions and the wastewater influent characteristics that influence the N2O emissions were identified as being the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics due to the filter washing steps, leading to rapid transitions from oxic to sub-oxic conditions, as well as the (re-)adaptation of microbial consortia due to the dynamics of the biofilm thickness associated to the daily washing process. This study shows the impact that the washing process and seawater infiltration has on the N2O emissions of a BAF and contributes to a better understanding of the operational conditions impacting the emissions in WWTPs.",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,26,20,20939-20948,WOS:000473172800076,10.1007/s11356-019-05470-x,,#20007,Vieira 2019,,
1998,"A drinking water utility's perspective on bromide, bromate, and ozonation","Bonacquisti, TP","Application of ozone in drinking water treatment plants in the US is growing because of ozone's multiple benefits. Ozone functions as a powerful oxidizing agent and disinfecting agent, it improves finished water quality by reducing turbidity, it reduces the formation of many halogenated disinfection by-products, and it is capable of treating chlorine resistant organisms like cryptosporidia. However, when bromide ion is present, e.g. from the geology, runoff, or sea water intrusion, ozone will convert some of the bromide to bromate depending upon the treatment reaction conditions. Bromate can also be introduced into drinking water as a contaminant in the chlorine used for disinfection. The current maximum contaminant level (MCL) in the USA is 0.010 mg/L, and the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) is zero, because of the possibility that bromate may function as a genotoxic carcinogen. The level of the MCL, especially if it is lowered, will significantly impact the ability of many water suppliers to utilize ozone in their water treatment processes and also raise the costs of those applications.

Despite the potentially crucial role of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves in tree survival, their dynamics in the process of death under seawater exposure are unknown. Here we monitored progressive tree mortality and associated NSC storage in Sitka-spruce (Picea sitchensis) trees dying under ecosystem-scale increases in seawater exposure in western Washington, USA. All trees exposed to seawater, because of monthly tidal intrusion, experienced declining crown foliage during the sampling period, and individuals with a lower percentage of live foliated crown (PLFC) died faster. Tree PLFC was strongly correlated with subsurface salinity and needle ion contents. Total NSC concentrations in trees declined remarkably with crown decline, and reached extremely low levels at tree death (2.4% and 1.6% in leaves and branches, respectively, and 0.4% in stems and roots). Starch in all tissues was almost completely consumed, while sugars remained at a homeostatic level in foliage. The decreasing NSC with closer proximity to death and near zero starch at death are evidences that carbon starvation occurred during Sitka-spruce mortality during seawater exposure.

2001,Attenuation of organic pollutants and the effects of salinity and seasonality in a Mediterranean micro-estuary,"Topaz, T","Micro-estuaries are small ubiquitous transitional water bodies that are often located in semi-arid zones. Unlike the vastly studied large estuaries, micro-estuaries lack the ability to dilute and contain pollution from point and non -point sources due to low natural water discharges. Therefore, these diverse ecological systems are susceptible to pol-lutant loads due to prolonged water residence time and complex geochemical dynamics. Although this elevated an-thropogenic stress limits their potential to provide ecological and recreational services, micro-estuaries have some traits similar to those found in wetlands, which provide a natural potential to retain and mitigate organic pollutants. A two consecutive years study conducted at the Alexander micro-estuary tracked the influx and outflux of a large or-ganic pollutant mixture during base-flow and flood events. During the research period, 165 kg of active ingredients entered the micro-estuary and 160 kg flowed out to the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting negligible net attenuation. However, this broad picture conceals inner shifts in pollutant mixture loads, which contained 46 pesticides and 19 pharmaceuticals. Only a handful of pollutants were actually balanced, whereas most compounds were either removed or added to the flow, with no observed correlation to chemical properties. A prominent observation was the load in-crease along the flow for some pollutants during base-flow conditions. This trend, which was correlated with salinity elevation and was verified in lab experiments, suggests that seawater intrusion to the bottom of the estuary may in-crease desorption rates of pollutants from the estuary bed, creating an estuarine desorption magnification effect. The combination of strong anthropogenic stress with increased desorption rates severely limits the estuary's potential to mitigate pollutants, frequently transforming it into a pollution source rather than a sink.",2023,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,856,,,WOS:000871095200009,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158919,,#20018,Topaz 2023,,

Tides were semidiurnal, showing an asymmetric pattern with longer ebb tides and shorter flood tides. The hydrodynamic data revealed strong seasonal variation, the ebb velocities were significantly higher than flood current velocities during wet season, whereas a slight difference was found in current velocities during dry season, while the ebb phase lasted longer than flood during wet season; however no significant difference was observed during dry season. On the other hand during flood period the water currents were substantially higher and unidirectional related to the strong river flow. Turbidity values were considerably higher during flood season, than wet and dry seasons along the channel. However hydrological parameters such as temperature and dissolved Oxygen also revealed seasonal and spatial fluctuations, though they were within permissible range. The salinity distribution along the channel was related to the incoming river flow and tidal propagation. Higher salinity values were recorded in dry season, suggested that salinity variation at Estuary was due to salt intrusion from the North Arabian Sea, related to the absent of fluvial discharge form Indus River.Present study revealed substantial changes for hydrology and hydrodynamic conditions of the Indus River Estuary, related to the varying Indus River flow, as well as winds are another important atmospheric force in this region which enhanced the tidal forcing during southwest monsoon.",2017,,MAUSAM,68,4,643-654,WOS:000417966100006,,,#20021,Kalhoro 2017,,

Furthermore, these alterations have the potential to cause significant environmental changes to estuaries and adjacent coastal areas. Here, the hydrodynamics of Pathos Lagoon was investigated before and after the jetty alterations, where the jetty was increased by approximately 10-18% and the mouth width was reduced by 15%. The TELEMAC-3D numerical model was calibrated and validated using the field data, and then simulated for characteristic low and high extreme discharge years for the old and new jetty configurations. Results showed a flow reduction of approximately 20% both in the ebb and flood conditions in the new configuration, which was accompanied by a slight change in the propagation angle of the western jetty current. Reduction of the saltwater intrusion was registered during both the high and low discharge conditions with the new jetty configuration. During the high discharge periods with NE winds, saltwater intrusion did not reach the previous estuarine inland boundary. During the period of low discharge with SW wind, salinity did not reach further than 180 km inland. Reduced saltwater intrusion was estimated landwards and in the shallow embayments. The horizontal stratification structure of the salinity changed, with the partial centralization of the flow in the access channel. The observed hydrodynamic changes from the infrastructure modifications could affect the estuarine ecosystem by increasing the sediment retention, reducing the transport of marine organisms and water properties into the estuary.

Based on the Ghijben-Herzberg and hillslope-storage Boussinesq equations, analytical solutions were derived for steady-state seawater intrusion in ASAs, with a focus on the freshwater-seawater interface and its corresponding watertable elevation. Predictions of the analytical solutions compared well with experimental data, and so they were employed to investigate the effects of aquifer geometry on seawater intrusion in island aquifers. Three different ASA geometries were compared: convergent (smaller side is facing the lagoon, larger side is the internal no-flow boundary and flow converges towards the lagoon), rectangular and divergent (smaller side is the internal no-flow boundary, larger side is facing the sea and flow diverges towards the sea). Depending on the aquifer geometry, seawater intrusion was found to vary greatly, such that the assumption of a rectangular aquifer to model an ASA can lead to poor estimates of seawater intrusion. Other factors being equal, compared with rectangular aquifers, seawater intrusion is more extensive, and watertable elevation is lower in divergent aquifers, with the opposite tendency in convergent aquifers. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that the effects of aquifer geometry on seawater intrusion and watertable elevation vary with aquifer width and distance from the circle center to the inner arc (the lagoon boundary for convergent aquifers or the internal no-flow boundary for divergent aquifers). A larger aquifer width and distance from the circle center to the inner arc weaken the effects of aquifer geometry, and hence differences in predictions for the three geometries become less pronounced.",2021,,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,25,12,6591-6602,WOS:000733613300001,10.5194/hess-25-6591-2021,,#20024,Luo 2021,,

This research was designed to explore the effectiveness of using a novel and promising method of monitoring the continuous salinity intrusion and velocity distribution in a tidal channel using the FAT scheme. Four FAT units were installed near the riverbanks using a new zigzag system in a rectangular tomographic domain of 700 m x 170 m. The water velocities and salinities measured by FAT in this study were comparable to the data captured by traditional methods, including moving-boat Stream-Pro ADCP, CTD, and CT sensors. It was found that the delays in time between the maximum salinity and high water level along the channel ranged from 12 min to 1.5 h, with these time lags increasing seaward, primarily due to changes in freshwater flows upstream. In addition, the longitudinal salinity gradient was found to decrease toward the mouth of the river, with tide-driven mechanisms most likely being dominant in the dispersion process.

2008,"Isotopic compositions (delta D, delta O-18) and end-member mixing for the control interface in a complex tidal region","Xie, RR; Zhen, L; Wu, XZ; Li, JB","Identifying the mixing processes of waters and currents in tidal reach is an important aspect of environmental management to protect freshwater resources and prevent water pollution. In this study, three field investigations conducted in a typical tidal reach in August, November and the following April focused on two isotopes (delta D and delta 18O) and salinity. A salinity-isotope conservative mixing model was established to differentiate water flows of the important control interface (CI) from freshwater, transition zone and saltwater end-members. Results suggested that the average delta D and delta 18O values during the ebb and flood tides depleted from August to November, then enriched significantly in the following April and were even higher than those in August. The delta D and delta 18O values in the saltwater zone enriched markedly compared with those in freshwater zone and transition zone due to the stronger evaporation occurring in the saltwater zone. Based on the revised model, the average contributions of freshwater end-member, transition zone end-member and saltwater end-member in three months were, respectively, 51.50 %, 36.93 % and 11.57 %. However, the contributions of freshwater and transition zones in April end-member were equivalent (47.45 % vs 44.31 %). Meanwhile the largest contribution of saltwater end-member was 20.56 % and occurred in August. The proportions of three endmembers that contributed to CI changed with different evaporation scenarios and moisture sources of precipitation. Our research provides important information that furthers our understanding of the isotopes and their applications to environmental management in estuarine regions.",2023,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,866,,,WOS:000997339200001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161438,,#20026,Xie 2023,,
2010,Effects of channel regulation on salt intrusion and residual circulation of Keelung River,"Liu, WC","A vertical (laterally integrated) two-dimensional numerical model was applied to study the hydrodynamic characteristics, salt-water intrusion and residual circulation in the Danshuei River estuarine system. The cross-sectional profiles measured in 2001 and 1990 respectively represent the conditions after and before channel regulation in the Keelung River. The model was re-verified with the available hydrological data measured in 2001. Detailed model re-verification has been conducted with water surface elevations, tidal cur-rent, and salinity distributions measured. The overall performance of the model is in qualitative agreement with the available field data. The model was then used to investigate the change in tidal ranges, salt-water intrusion, and residual circulation as a result of channel regulation in the Keelung River. The model simulations indicate that more tidal energy propagates into the estuarine system before channel regulation because of the substantial increase in river cross-sections. The residual circulations before channel regulation are greater than those after channel regulation and result in the limits of the salt intrusion before channel regulation being extended farther inland than those after channel regulation. This may show that channel regulation for flood control in the Keelung River did not contribute to the expansion of the mangrove areas and the disappearance of freshwater marshes at the Kuan-Du wetlands.

2014,The Transformation of Salinity Variance: A New Approach to Quantifying the Influence of Straining and Mixing on Estuarine Stratification,"Li, XY; Geyer, WR; Zhu, JR; Wu, H","The roles of straining and dissipation in controlling stratification are derived analytically using a vertical salinity variance method. Stratification is produced by converting horizontal variance to vertical variance via straining, that is, differential advection of horizontal salinity gradients, and stratification is destroyed by the dissipation of vertical variance through turbulent mixing. A numerical model is applied to the Changjiang estuary in order to demonstrate the salinity variance balance and how it reveals the factors controlling stratification. The variance analysis reveals that dissipation reaches its maximum during spring tide in the Changjiang estuary, leading to the lowest stratification. Stratification increases from spring tide to neap tide because of the increasing excess of straining over dissipation. Throughout the spring-neap tidal cycle, straining is almost always larger than dissipation, indicating a net excess of production of vertical variance relative to dissipation. This excess is balanced on average by advection, which exports vertical variance out of the estuarine region into the plume. During neap tide, tidal straining shows a general tendency of destratification during the flood tide and restratification during ebb, consistent with the one-dimensional theory of tidal straining. During spring tide, however, positive straining occurs during flood because of the strong baroclinicity induced by the intensified horizontal salinity gradient. These results indicate that the salinity variance method provides a valuable approach for examining the spatial and temporal variability of stratification in estuaries and coastal environments.",2018,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,48,3,607-623,WOS:000430757700008,10.1175/JPO-D-17-0189.1,,#20036,Li 2018,,

The impact of the scenarios on the water supply scheme of the Pearl River Delta was investigated. The results showed that (1) the water shortage of the Pearl River Delta is highly dependent upon the dryness combination of the upstream runoff during the dry period, in particular to the cities at the Pearl River Delta estuary, the water shortages are seriously influenced by saltwater intrusion; and (2) the water transfer projects could alleviate the water supply pressure of the Pearl River Delta when there is an extreme or more dryness encounter of upstream runoff. However, when extreme dryness events are impacting the upstream runoff of the West River, the impact of the water transfer projects is weakened and much of the critical upstream runoff for saltwater suppression cannot be satisfied, which largely impacts water withdrawals at the downstream cities in the Pearl River Delta estuary.",2023,,WATER POLICY,25,2,87-115,WOS:000934477700001,10.2166/wp.2023.096,,#20038,He 2023,,
2016,"The Mekong Deltaic Coast: Past, Present and Future Morphology","Linh, PK; Stive, MJF","This contribution addresses some important issues with regard to the future development of the Mekong Delta Coast and Estuaries in the context of environmental and climate change. After a general review of present and future environmental and morphologic conditions, two highly relevant issues will be discussed in more detail. The first issue concerns the morphological impact of possible construction of discharge sluices in the three main branches of Tien River to prevent salt intrusion. The second issue concerns the impact of sea dike construction on the health of the existing mangrove forests. The Mekong Delta Estuaries play an important role in flood relief, water transportation, water management and land reclamation; however they are also the root of serious problems such as salinity intrusion and tide-induced high water levels. According to possible future development plans, discharge sluices could be constructed in the three main branches of Tien River to prevent salinity intrusion. To evaluate the consequences of these structures to the Mekong Delta Estuaries, an empirical relationship between tidal prism and river cross-section is derived. Based on field observations an important result derived for the Mekong Delta Estuaries is an empirical relationship between the tidal and river discharge prism, P and Q, and the river cross-section, A(c). Using this finding, it is found that the two open branches of Tien River will deepen by more than 10 meters when all three other branches are closed. Thus, mangroves along the river bank of these two branches should be strengthened in order to prevent river bank erosion. Due to the need of land for agriculture and other economic sectors, sea dikes are always built close to or often even in the mangroves forest. Along the Southern Coast of Viet Nam there are many places where mangrove degradation and coastline erosion is observed on a large scale when sea dikes are built too close to or in the mangrove forests. Based on field observations a relationship is derived relating mangroves width and coastline evolution. It is concluded that a critical value of 300 to 400 meters of mangroves width is necessary for the stability of the East Coast of Viet Nam.",2013,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS, VOLS III AND IV",,,,WOS:000370410300057,,,#20039,Linh 2013,,

In this paper we provide a connection between the empirical equation and the theoretical literature, leading to a theoretical range of Van der Burgh's coefficient of 1/2 < K < 2/3 for density-driven mixing which falls within the feasible range of 0 < K < 1. In addition, we developed a one-dimensional predictive equation for the dispersion of salinity as a function of local hydraulic parameters that can vary along the estuary axis, including mixing due to tide-driven residual circulation. This type of mixing is relevant in the wider part of alluvial estuaries where preferential ebb and flood channels appear. Subsequently, this dispersion equation is combined with the salt balance equation to obtain a new predictive analytical equation for the longitudinal salinity distribution. Finally, the new equation was tested and applied to a large database of observations in alluvial estuaries, whereby the calibrated K values appeared to correspond well to the theoretical range.",2017,,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,21,7,3287-3305,WOS:000404793000002,10.5194/hess-21-3287-2017,,#20042,Zhang 2017,,

2030,Groundwater use and salinization with grassland afforestation,"Jobbagy, EG; Jackson, RB","Vegetation changes, particularly transitions between tree- and grass-dominated states, can alter ecosystem water balances and soluble salt fluxes. Here we outline a general predictive framework for understanding salinization of afforested grasslands based on biophysical, hydrologic, and edaphic factors. We tested this framework in 20 paired grassland and adjacent afforested plots across ten sites in the Argentine Pampas. Rapid salinization of groundwater and soils in afforested plots was associated with increased evapotranspiration and groundwater consumption by trees, with maximum salinization occurring on intermediately textured soils. Afforested plots (10-100 ha in size) showed 4-19-fold increases in groundwater salinity on silty upland soils but <twofold increases on clay loess soils and sand dunes. Two years of salinity and groundwater measurements at a 40 ha Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation revealed that the plantation reduced groundwater recharge, underwent groundwater discharge on >50% of the days, and depressed the water table 38 cm on average compared to the adjacent grassland. Soil cores and vertical electrical soundings indicated that approximate to6 kg m(-2) of salts accumulated close to the water table and suggested that salinization resulted from the exclusion of fresh groundwater solutes by tree roots. Groundwater use with afforestation in the Pampas and in other regions around the world can enhance primary production and provide a tool for flood control. However, our framework and experimental data also suggest that afforestation can compromise the quality of soils and water resources in predictable ways based on water use, climate, and soil texture.",2004,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,10,8,1299-1312,WOS:000222869600006,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00806.x,,#20061,Jobbagy 2004,,

Water utilities and regional suppliers are responsible for their own water supply plans and adaptation strategies, which are developed largely by a relatively small group of technical specialists (internal and contracted). Water supply planning is prescribed by the state water governance system and local community planning processes. The degree of engagement of large coastal communities and water utilities and regional water suppliers in Florida with climate change research is generally high. Climate change-induced impacts to water supplies and demands over the common 20-year planning horizon are likely to be small relative to increases in demand caused by projected on-going population growth and normal climatic variation. Water utilities in Florida have been incidentally moving toward more climate-resilient supplies (e.g., brackish groundwater desalination) due to the unavailability of additional permittable, inexpensive fresh groundwater rather than climate change concerns.

2034,Sedimentological evolution of Sele Formation deep-marine depositional systems of the Central North Sea,"Eldrett, J; Tripsanas, E; Davis, C; McKie, T; Vieira, M; Osterloff, P; Sandison, T","The Paleocene-Eocene-aged Sele Formation is developed across the basinal region of the Central North Sea. The section comprises a number of deep-marine fan systems that expanded and contracted across the basin floor in response to relative sea-level changes on the basin margin and fluctuating sediment yield off the Scottish landmass modulated by climate and hinterland uplift. Persistent sediment entry points to the basin resulted in the development of discrete axial and transverse fan fairways with a geometry dictated by an irregular bathymetry sculpted by differential compaction across Mesozoic faults, halokinesis and antecedent fan systems. A high-resolution biostratigraphic framework has allowed the evolution of fan-dispersal systems in response to these effects to be tracked across the basin within four genetic sequences. The proximal parts of the fans comprised channel complexes of low sinuosity, high lateral offset, and low aggradation. The development of these systems in a bathymetrically confined corridor of the Central Graben (c. 65 km wide), combined with high sediment supply, resulted in the eventual burial of any underlying relief. The behaviour of sand-rich reservoirs in this region is dominated by the permeability contrast between high-quality channel fairways and more heterolithic overbank regions, with the potential for early water breakthrough and aquifer coning in the channel fairways, and unswept volumes in overbank locations. Compartmentalization of compensationally stacked channel bodies occurs locally, with stratigraphic trapping caused by lateral channel pinch-outs, channel-base debrites, mud-rich drapes and abandonment fines. Towards the southern part of Quadrant 22, approximately 150 km down-palaeoflow, the systems became less confined and in this region are dominated by channel-lobe complexes, which continued to interact with an irregular bathymetry controlled by antecedent fans, mass-transport complexes and halokinesis in the form of rising salt diapirs. Reservoirs in this region are inherently stratigraphically compartmentalized by their heterolithic lithology and compensational stacking of lobes, and further complicated by structuration and instability induced by the diapiric or basement structures needed to generate a trapping structure in these settings.",2015,,TERTIARY DEEP-MARINE RESERVOIRS OF THE NORTH SEA REGION,403,,63-98,WOS:000368011700004,10.1144/SP403.9,,#20067,Eldrett 2015,,
2037,The future Aral Sea: hope and despair,"Micklin, P","The Aral Sea in 1960 was a huge brackish water lake (4th in the world in surface area) lying amidst the deserts of Central Asia. The sea supported a major fishery and functioned as a key regional transportation route. Since 1960, the Aral has undergone rapid desiccation and salinization, overwhelmingly the result of unsustainable expansion of irrigation that dried up its two tributary rivers the Amu Darya and Syr Darya and severely damaged their deltas. The desiccation of the Aral Sea has had severe negative impacts, including, among others, the demise of commercial fishing, devastation of the floral and faunal biodiversity of the native ecosystems of the Syr and Amu deltas, and increased frequency and strength of salt/dust storms. However, efforts have been and are being made to partially restore the sea's hydrology along with its biodiversity, and economic value. The northern part of the Aral has been separated from the southern part by a dike and dam, leading to a level rise and lower salinity. This allowed native fishes to return from the rivers and revitalized the fishing industry. Partial preservation of the Western Basin of the southern Aral Sea may be possible, but these plans need much further environmental and economic analysis. This paper, mainly utilizing hydrologic and other data as input to spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel)-based hydrologic and salinity models, examines the current efforts to restore the Aral and looks at several future scenarios of the Sea. It also delineates the most important lessons of the Aral Sea's drying.",2016,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,75,9,,WOS:000376030100120,10.1007/s12665-016-5614-5,,#20070,Micklin 2016,,
2038,Response of the lower St. Lawrence Estuary to external forcing in winter,"Smith, GC; Saucier, FJ; Straub, D","Mostly because of a lack of observations, fundamental aspects of the St. Lawrence Estuary's wintertime response to forcing remain poorly understood. The results of a field campaign over the winter of 2002/03 in the estuary are presented. The response of the system to tidal forcing is assessed through the use of harmonic analyses of temperature, salinity, sea level, and current observations. The analyses confirm previous evidence for the presence of semidiurnal internal tides, albeit at greater depths than previously observed for ice-free months. The low-frequency tidal streams were found to be mostly baroclinic in character and to produce an important neap tide intensification of the estuarine circulation. Despite stronger atmospheric momentum forcing in winter, the response is found to be less coherent with the winds than seen in previous studies of ice-free months. The tidal residuals show the cold intermediate layer in the estuary is renewed rapidly ( 14 days) in late March by the advection of a wedge of near-freezing waters from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In situ processes appeared to play a lesser role in the renewal of this layer. In particular, significant wintertime deepening of the estuarine surface mixed layer was prevented by surface stability, which remained high throughout the winter. The observations also suggest that the bottom circulation was intensified during winter, with the intrusion in the deep layer of relatively warm Atlantic waters, such that the 3 C isotherm rose from below 150 m to near 60 m.",2006,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,36,8,1485-1501,WOS:000240675800001,10.1175/JPO2927.1,,#20072,Smith 2006,,

To better describe and understand these processes and their variability, it is necessary to combine the sparse available observations with the best-possible numerical descriptions of ocean circulation. In particular, high ice shelf melting rates in the Amundsen Sea have attracted many observational campaigns, and we now have some limited oceanographic data that capture seasonal and interannual variability during the past decade. One method to combine observations with numerical models that can maximize the information extracted from the sparse observations is the adjoint method, a.k.a. 4D-Var (4-dimensional variational assimilation), as developed and implemented for global ocean state estimation by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project. Here, for the first time, we apply the adjoint-model estimation method to a regional configuration of the Amundsen and Bellings-shausen seas, Antarctica, including explicit representation of sub-ice-shelf cavities. We utilize observations available during 2010-2014, including ship-based and seal-tagged CTD measurements, moorings, and satellite sea-ice concentration estimates. After 20 iterations of the adjoint-method minimization algorithm, the cost function, here defined as a sum of the weighted model-data difference, is reduced by 65% relative to the baseline simulation by adjusting initial conditions, atmospheric forcing, and vertical diffusivity. The seaice and ocean components of the cost function are reduced by 59% and 70 %, respectively. Major improvements include better representations of (1) WinterWater (WW) characteristics and (2) intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) towards the Pine Island Glacier. Sensitivity experiments show that similar to 40% and similar to 10% of improvements in sea ice and ocean state, respectively, can be attributed to the adjustment of air temperature and wind. This study is a preliminary demonstration of adjoint-method optimization with explicit representation of ice shelf cavity circulation. Despite the 65% cost reduction, substantial model-data discrepancies remain, in particular with annual and interannual variability observed by moorings in front of the Pine Island Ice Shelf. We list a series of possible causes for these residuals, including limitations of the model, the optimization methodology, and observational sampling. In particular, we hypothesize that residuals could be further reduced if the model could more accurately represent sea-ice concentration and coastal polynyas.",2021,,GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,14,8,4909-4924,WOS:000683784900001,10.5194/gmd-14-4909-2021,,#20073,Nakayama 2021,,

To understand the hydrodynamics and salinity transport in the trial dredged trench of Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link project, a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic numerical model is set up based on SUNTANS, an unstructured-grid ocean and coastal simulator. The predictions of water surface elevation, current velocities and salinity are in good agreement with field observations in June 2016. The simulated results reveal that mean velocity reduces dramatically in the deepest area of trial dredged trench, and the current velocities in the bottom layers at the trench center are quite smaller than those in the top layers. Salinity in the trench changes periodically with the tide, with saline water concentrating in bottom layers at the trench center at most of the time. These variation of hydrodynamics and salinity may increase the probability of sediment deposition in the trench. At the end of flood towards higher high tide, the intrusion of the saline water in the bottom layers into the trench leads to a cyclone style vortex in the west part of the trench, and a vortex is formed above the south slope, which make the hydrodynamics more complicated to some extent.",2021,,FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,30,12,12766-12775,WOS:000728493300008,,,#20085,Song 2021,,

The total concentrations of PBDEs ranged from 0.13 to 1.98 ng g(-1) d.w. BDE209 was the dominating congener in all sediment samples, indicating the pollution of PBDEs in the Daliao River Estuary mainly came from the use of deca-BDE commercial mixtures. The intrusion of sea waters promoted the deposition of the colloid-associated PBDEs in the estuary. There were significantly negative correlations between PBDE concentration in sediment with pH value and salinity in the bottom water. The higher river flow in the flood season (summer) obviously accelerated the transport of PBDEs, and thereby increased the risk of PBDE contamination to the deep ocean. Moreover, a positive correlation between TOC and PBDE distributions was observed, suggesting that TOC regulated the distributions of PBDEs in sediments of Daliao River Estuary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2062,IMPACT OF EXPECTED CLIMATE-CHANGE ON MANGROVES,"FIELD, CD","There is a consensus of scientific opinion that the activities of man will cause a significant change in the global climate over the next hundred years. The rising level of carbon dioxide and other industrial gases in the atmosphere may lead to global warming with an accompanying rise in sea-level. Mangrove ecosystems grow in the intertidal zones in tropical and sub-tropical regions and are likely to be early indicators of the effects of climate change. The best estimates of predicted climate change in the literature are presented. It is suggested that a rise in mean sea-level may be the most important factor influencing the future distribution of mangroves but that the effect will vary dramatically depending on the local rate of sea-level rise and the availability of sediment to support reestablishment of the mangroves. The predicted rise in mean air temperature will probably be of little consequence to the development of mangroves in general but it may mean that the presence of mangroves will move further north and south, though this will depend on a number of additional factors. The effect of enhanced atmospheric CO2 on the growth of mangroves is unknown at this time but that there is some evidence that not all species of mangroves will respond similarly. The socio-economic impacts of the effects of climate change on mangrove ecosystems may include increased risk of flooding, increased erosion of coast lines, saline intrusion and increased storm surges.",1995,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,295,1-3,75-81,WOS:A1995QH48700011,10.1007/BF00029113,,#20112,FIELD 1995,,
2065,Leaf gas films delay salt entry and enhance underwater photosynthesis and internal aeration of Melilotus siculus submerged in saline water,"Teakle, NL; Colmer, TD; Pedersen, O","A combination of flooding and salinity is detrimental to most plants. We studied tolerance of complete submergence in saline water for Melilotus siculus, an annual legume with superhydrophobic leaf surfaces that retain gas films when under water. M.siculus survived complete submergence of 1 week at low salinity (up to 50molm(-3) NaCl), but did not recover following de-submergence from 100molm(-3) NaCl. The leaf gas films protected against direct salt ingress into the leaves when submerged in saline water, enabling underwater photosynthesis even after 3d of complete submergence. By contrast, leaves with the gas films experimentally removed suffered from substantial Na+ and Cl- intrusion and lost the capacity for underwater photosynthesis. Similarly, plants in saline water and without gas films lost more K+ than those with intact gas films. This study has demonstrated that leaf gas films reduce Na+ and Cl- ingress into leaves when submerged by saline water - the thin gas layer physically separates the floodwater from the leaf surface. This feature aids survival of plants exposed to short-term saline submergence, as well as the previously recognized beneficial effects of gas exchange under water.",2014,,PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT,37,10,2339-2349,WOS:000342613700011,10.1111/pce.12269,,#20116,Teakle 2014,,
2066,Marine intrusion and freshwater discharge as opposite forces driving fish guilds distribution along coastal plain streams,"Bastos, RF; Calliari, LJ; Garcia, AM","This work investigated variations in fish guilds along marine surf zone to freshwater reaches of coastal plain streams and their relationships with environmental factors. Fish and abiotic data were collected monthly during 1 year and an automatic image-recording system was used to monitor marine intrusion events. Aside ephemeral salinity gradients produced by storm surges, freshwater conditions prevailed inside streams. Despite of that, fish habitat use guilds were spatially distributed according to their salinity tolerance, with marine species occurring mainly in the stream site near the adjacent surf zone and non-salinity tolerant freshwater fish in the upstream site. Marine intrusion was the main factor correlated with the entrance of marine-related fish into streams during summer. In contrast, higher rainfall during colder months prevented the dominance of marine species. This work highlighted that spatial segregation in fish habitat use guild could occur even in the absence of long-lasting salinity gradients, since active colonization by euryhaline fish and sporadic marine intrusions can lead to the occurrence of marine-related fish in coastal plain streams. Future studies should evaluate if this marine intrusion role on fish of coastal plain streams would be affected by changes in sea level and rainfall in a global warming scenario.",2014,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,726,1,245-258,WOS:000330836300017,10.1007/s10750-013-1771-7,,#20118,Bastos 2014,,
2068,"Holocene environmental history of a small Mediterranean island in response to sea-level changes, climate and human impact","Poher, Y; Ponel, P; Medail, F; Andrieu-Ponel, V; Guiter, F","The aim of this study is to investigate human-climate-environment interactions in a small Mediterranean island. Comparison between palynological and palaeoentomological data from the Greco pond (Cavallo Island, southern Corsica) reveals that the island was first covered by a more-or-less open Erica arborea pasture-woodland from ca. 7000 to 6100 cal. yr B.P. Grazing animals from 7000 to 6200 cal. yr B.P., followed by a spreading of Ficus carica (marked by the bark beetle Hypoborus ficus) from ca. 6100 to 5750 cal. yr B.P., suggest that human activities could be implicated in the E. arborea forest opening. From ca. 5500 cal. yr B.P., a regional expansion of Q ilex was recorded, but an open landscape with thermophilous and drought-tolerant plants locally took place from ca. 4700 cal. yr B.P. onward. Pastoral and agricultural biomarkers (pollen, NPP and insect) together with archaeological evidence indicate that human activities were involved in the installation of a lasting open vegetation. Simultaneously, the effects of the Holocene relative sea-level rise on the coastal wetland are recorded: (1) freshwater conditions prevailed in the Greco pond since 7000 cal. yr B.P. at least, (2) the first evidence of salt marsh development dates back to ca. 4500 cal. yr B.P., (3) a strong increase of salinity with marine intrusions were recorded at ca. 3700 cal. yr B.P. while a decline in aquatic insect diversity occurred and (4) a phase of sand dune formation was recorded from ca. 2000 cal. yr B.P. onward. Our results suggest that if large-scale climatic trend such as the Holocene relative sea-level rise could affect coastal ecosystem, effects of human activities could play the leading role in vegetation and terrestrial beetle assemblage changes in a small island context.

2070,Recent Warming Trends in the Arabian Sea: Causative Factors and Physical Mechanisms,"Albert, J; Gulakaram, VS; Vissa, NK; Bhaskaran, PK; Dash, MK","In recent years, and particularly from 2000 onwards, the North Indian Ocean (NIO) has been acting as a major sink of ocean heat that is clearly visible in the sub-surface warming trend. Interestingly, a part of the NIO-the Arabian Sea (AS) sector-witnessed dramatic variations in recent sub-surface warming that has direct repercussion on intense Tropical Cyclone (TC) activity. This study investigated the possible causative factors and physical mechanisms towards the multi-decadal warming trends in surface and sub-surface waters over the AS region. Responsible factors towards warming are examined using altimetric observations and reanalysis products. This study used ORAS5 OHC (Ocean Heat Content), derived meridional and zonal heat transport, currents, temperature, salinity, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), and air-sea fluxes to quantify the OHC build-up and its variability at water depths of 700 m (D-700) and 300 m (D-300) during the past four decades. The highest variability in deeper and upper OHC is noticed for the western and southern regions of the Indian Ocean. The warming trend is significantly higher in the deeper regions of AS compared to the upper waters, and relatively higher compared to the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Increased OHC in AS show good correlation with decreased OLR in the past 20 years. An analysis of altimetric observations revealed strengthening of downwelling Kelvin wave propagation leading to warming in eastern AS, mainly attributed due to intrusion of low saline water from BoB leading to stratification. Rossby wave associated with deepening of thermocline warmed the southern AS during its propagation. Heat budget analysis reveals that surface heat fluxes play a dominant role in warming AS during the pre-monsoon season. Increasing (decreasing) trend of surface heat fluxes (vertical entrainment) during 2000-2018 played a significant role in warming the southeastern sector of AS.",2023,,CLIMATE,11,2,,WOS:000938289700001,10.3390/cli11020035,,#20126,Albert 2023,,
2072,Circulation dynamics and salt balance in a lagoonal estuary,"Jia, P; Li, M","Albemarle-Pamlico Sound (APS) is a shallow lagoonal estuary connected to the Atlantic Ocean through narrow inlets. The circulation dynamics and salt balance in this estuary are investigated using a numerical model. Although the vertical stratification is weak, the mean flow features a two-layer gravitational circulation with speeds reaching several centimeters per second. Analysis of the momentum budget shows a primary balance among the barotropic pressure gradient as a result of sea level slope, the baroclinic pressure gradient due to horizontal salinity gradients, and stress divergence. The salt budget for APS is determined by the balance between river flow and salt exchange through the inlets. At the inlets, the salt flux resulting from estuarine shear flow is much weaker than that due to tidal pumping and subtidal barotropic transport. Tidal pumping produces a net influx of salt into APS: Strong flood currents push oceanic water into the estuary through a propagating density front, whereas ebb currents advect lighter estuarine water over denser bottom water. The salt flux due to the subtidal barotropic transport across the inlets shows large temporal fluctuations associated with wind events. This transport can be either a source or sink of salt to APS and correlates well with the sea level difference across each inlet. Higher-sea level on the shelf leads to an intrusion of oceanic water into APS whereas higher-sea level inside APS leads to a withdrawal of estuarine water to the shelf.",2012,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,117,,,WOS:000298932000001,10.1029/2011JC007124,,#20129,Jia 2012,,

We propose as a triggering mechanism a limited precursory melt that intrudes and heats the mantle lithosphere, lowering its viscosity, and increasing its density as the melt freezes into eclogite. This warm, dense mantle lithosphere is then removed via a Rayleigh-Taylor instability that creates surface subsidence. Removal of the mantle lithosphere lengthens the melting column, and the melt volume of the SFB can be produced in less than a million years. The model is permissive of the existing geologic data for the SFB, which lute our a traditional hot, deep mantle plume, Numerical models demonstrate that the ability of a mantle upwelling to remove lithosphere is dependent primarily upon the lithospheric rheology, not on the temperature or size of the upwelling.",2000,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,27,23,3937-3940,WOS:000165646700045,,,#20130,Elkins-Tanton 2000,,

To clarify these phenomena, it is necessary to carry out analysis with a vertical two-dimensional or three-dimensional numerical model. Further, the modeling of tide effects at the upstream boundary is an important issue. We carry out numerical analysis on the saline intrusion caused by propagation of tide, with two-dimensional Reynolds and diffusion equations used as the governing equations.

2081,Effects of episodic rainfall on a subterranean estuary,"Yu, XY; Xin, P; Lu, CH; Robinson, C; Li, L; Barry, DA","Numerical simulations were conducted to examine the effect of episodic rainfall on nearshore groundwater dynamics in a tidally influenced unconfined coastal aquifer, with a focus on both long-term (yearly) and short-term (daily) behavior of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and seawater intrusion (SWI). The results showed nonlinear interactions among the processes driven by rainfall, tides, and density gradients. Rainfall-induced infiltration increased the yearly averaged fresh groundwater discharge to the ocean but reduced the extents of the saltwater wedge and upper saline plume as well as the total rate of seawater circulation through both zones. Overall, the net effect of the interactions led to an increase of the SGD. The nearshore groundwater responded to individual rainfall events in a delayed and cumulative fashion, as evident in the variations of daily averaged SGD and salt stored in the saltwater wedge (quantifying the extent of SWI). A generalized linear model (GLM) along with a Gamma distribution function was developed to describe the delayed and prolonged effect of rainfall events on short-term groundwater behavior. This model validated with results of daily averaged SGD and SWI from the simulations of groundwater and solute transport using independent rainfall data sets, performed well in predicting the behavior of the near-shore groundwater system under the combined influence of episodic rainfall, tides, and density gradients. The findings and developed GLM form a basis for evaluating and predicting SGD, SWI, and associated mass fluxes from unconfined coastal aquifers under natural conditions, including episodic rainfall.",2017,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,53,7,5774-5787,WOS:000407895000033,10.1002/2017WR020809,,#20146,Yu 2017,,
2083,Soil salinization processes in rice irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Delta,"Ceuppens, J; Wopereis, MCS; Miezan, KM","Soil salinization constitutes a major threat to irrigated agriculture (mainly rice, Oryza sativa L.) in the Senegal River Delta. It is generally hypothesized that salinization is caused by (i) capillary rise from a saline water table and (ii) concentration of salts in the field due to lack of adequate drainage facilities. The impact of field water management and rice cropping intensity on salinization in the Delta was determined using an electromagnetic conductivity meter (Geonics EM38). More than 4000 measurements were made in 40 rice fields on a typical heavy clay soil (Vertic Xerofluvent). Thirty EM38 measurements per field (0.25 ha) estimated average field soil salinity with a relative error of 20%. A multiple linear regression model based on EM38 readings explained 60 to 75% of the variability in conductivity of 1:5 saturation extracts at 0- to 5-, 10- to 15-, and 30- to 35-cm depths. Higher cropping intensity limited upward salt transport from the water table. Average horizontal and vertical EM38 measurements increased in the following order: two rice crops per year with drainage: 0.73 and 0.98 dS m(-1); one rice crop per year with drainage: 1.26 and 1.76 dS m(-1); one rice crop per gear without drainage: 2.23 and 2.98 dS m(-1); and abandoned fields: 4.77 and 4.29 dS m(-1).

Existing mathematical models do not account explicitly for solute recycling during irrigation on a daily scale, which is considered as an important salinization input. The main objective of this research was to develop a mathematical numerical model that can simulate impact of irrigation return flow by coupling water and solute fluxes at the soil surface with quality of water pumped from the aquifer. This was obtained with a Quasi-3D model representing flow in the vadose zone - aquifer system by series of ID Richards' equations in a variably-saturated zone and by a 3D flow equation in groundwater. The 3D advection-dispersion equation is solved in the entire domain. Concentration of irrigation water is calculated at each time step as a function of concentration of both surface water and groundwater extracted at specific locations.The model was applied to simulate the impact of irrigation on groundwater salinization of Alto Piura aquifer (Northern Peru) over thirty years. Three scenarios were considered: (i) use of flood irrigation and groundwater extraction (the present situation); (ii) increase of groundwater pumping by 50% compared to the first scenario; and (iii) transition from flood irrigation to drip irrigation, thus decreasing irrigation volume by around 60% compared to the first scenario. Results indicate that in different irrigation areas, the simulated increase rates of total dissolved solids in groundwater vary from 3-5 to 15-17 mg/L/year, depending on hydrogeological and hydrochemical conditions, volumes of water extracted, and proportion between surface water and groundwater applied. The transition from flood irrigation to drip irrigation decreases the negative impact of return flow on groundwater quality; however drip irrigation causes faster soil salinization compared to flood irrigation. Irrigation return coefficients were calculated in the order of 21-23% and 22-24% for the first and second scenarios, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2085,"Frontogenesis and estuarine circulation at the shallow sill of a tropical fjord: Insights from Ambon Bay, eastern Indonesia","Salamena, GG; Whinney, JC; Heron, SF; Ridd, PV","Surface water flushing of the tropical fjord of Ambon Bay is linked to stratification and frontogenesis that vary with tidal and seasonal cycles. Tidal-and seasonal-based deployments of CTD casts and bottom-mounted current meters in 2019 coupled with an analytical model were employed to investigate estuarine circulation (i.e. flood/ebb-mean transport) at the sill of Ambon Bay. Spring tides produce a large (flood/ebb-mean) horizontal salinity gradient, 8S/8x, (up to 13 x 10-4 parts per thousand/m) across the sill, intensifying estuarine circulation. This intensification of 8S/8x is driven by strong (flood/ebb-mean) stratification at the inshore sill, associated with buoyant frontogenesis (indicated by densimetric Froude number, Fo2 >= 0.3) during the related strong flood tides. Estuarine circulation is stronger in the easterly monsoon (July) than in the transitional monsoon (October) since buoyant fronts are larger in thickness and horizontal extension along the sill in the easterly monsoon following high freshwater input. The estuarine circulation was intensified by a deep-water renewal process in which deep water from the adjacent open sea is upwelled to the sill by internal waves.Flushing of inner Ambon Bay (IAB, the fjord basin) due to estuarine circulation at the sill only occurs at the surface layer of IAB. Within a spring-neap sequence (similar to 2 weeks), the net oceanic inflow due to estuarine circulation at the sill replenished 73% and 41% volume of the surface layer of IAB in the easterly monsoon and the transitional season, respectively. The knowledge of flushing of IAB due to net oceanic inflow presented here has application for the mitigation of pollution build-up and for understanding of oceanic nutrient supply in the basin.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Both techniques defined the high and low groundwater potentialities regarding water quality and quantity and delineated the fresh/saline water interface.The groundwater exploration comprises 36 transient electromagnetic (TEM) sounding and 4 Two-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (2DERI) lines. The inversion of both geophysical methods reveals four consequent subsurface layers; 1) the surficial unsaturated alluvial sand deposits layer has a resistivity range of 50-538 Omega m, and thickness <10 m, 2) the partially saturated alluvial sand, 3) the saturated alluvial sand and silt with fresh/brackish groundwater, and 4) the lower saturated alluvial sand and gravel layer with saline groundwater and clay sheet intercalations. The third water-bearing layer acts as a thin fresh/brackish groundwater lense of a moderate resistivity (0.8-55 Omega m) floating over deeper saline groundwater with a very low resistivity range (0.8-5.8 Omega m).The relatively moderate to higher resistivity of the fresh/brackish groundwater zone recorded in the eastern side at the downstream portion of the study area indicates promising subsurface recharge. The thickness of this zone ranges from 4 to 24 m (Groundwater Group I; 507 <= TDS <= 3920 mg/L & Groundwater Group II; 4031 <= TDS <= 4717 mg/L). While the lower resistivity values characterize the northern and southern portions of higher groundwater salinity (Group III; 5144 TDS 6771 mg/L & Group IV 7452 TDS 27573 mg/L), suggesting mixing with deeper saline/seawater and intercalations of clay sheets. Regarding water quality, it is recommended to excavate the groundwater only for the freshwater/brackish zone to avoid up conning of deep saline groundwater.

To characterize these effects, we use long-term data (12-19 yr) and high-frequency specific conductance (SPC) data collected from 13 streams across New Hampshire, USA. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for chloride (Cl-) derived from high-frequency SPC showed distinct seasonal variability. Diluting behavior was common, but flushing behavior occurred in autumn and winter, suggesting that both groundwater and surface runoff contribute salts to streams. Long-term data show that although extreme flood events initially reduced salt concentrations in groundwater and rural streams, concentrations recovered to preflood conditions in about a decade. Chronic Cl- exceedances occurred in urban streams during all seasons.

The effect of hydrodynamic features on salinity was studied in the Senegal River Estuary (SRE). This estuary is of strategic importance for large populations, but it has been greatly affected by human action (regulation of the freshwater inflow, change in the location of the river mouth ...), which has caused major changes in salinity and ecological functioning. To analyse the impacts of these changes and to determine the spatial and temporal variations in salinity in the SRE, we used a combination of three-dimensional modelling and field measurements. The overall salinity depends on freshwater inflow and tidal fluctuations. Salinity variation is mainly driven by ebb and flood near the mouth and by fortnightly cycles upstream. The enlargement of the mouth increases salinity, whereas its shifting location changes the location of the salinity front and creates a slack water zone downstream. Connection and disconnection of the tributaries also affects the salinity. The present study explains how the recent modifications have increased spatial variation and reduced seasonal differences of salinity and provides a tool for managing the water in the estuary.",2014,,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,65,11,987-1002,WOS:000344381700005,10.1071/MF13169,,#20176,Chevalier 2014,,
2100,Semianalytical solutions for contaminant transport under variable velocity field in a coastal aquifer,"Koohbor, B; Fahs, M; Ataie-Ashtiani, B; Simmons, CT; Younes, A","Existing closed-form solutions of contaminant transport problems are limited by the mathematically convenient assumption of uniform flow. These solutions cannot be used to investigate contaminant transport in coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion induces a variable velocity field. An adaptation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is introduced to obtain semi-analytical solutions for contaminant transport in a confined coastal aquifer in which the saltwater wedge is in equilibrium with a freshwater discharge flow. Two scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary are considered. Robust implementation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is developed to efficiently solve the coupled flow, salt and contaminant transport equations. Various illustrative examples are generated and the semi-analytical solutions are compared against an in-house numerical code. The Fourier series are used to evaluate relevant metrics characterizing contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea, amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater and solute flux from the source. These metrics represent quantitative data for numerical code validation and are relevant to understand the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport. It is observed that, for the surface contamination scenario, seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant but intensifies the contaminant discharge to the sea. For the landward contamination scenario, moderate seawater intrusion affects only the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume while extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea. The developed semi-analytical solution presents an efficient tool for the verification of numerical models. It provides a clear interpretation of the contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion.

2101,The potential vulnerability indices as tools for natural risk reduction. The Volturno coastal plain case study,"Alberico, I; Iavarone, R; Angrisani, AC; Castiello, A; Incarnato, R; Barrra, R","Coastal areas are exposed to many hazardous events often exacerbeted by the sea-level rise with its related effects. The knowledge of vulnerability make possible to plan the actions aimed at reducing the risk and promoting the development of a resilient community. In this frame, the evaluation of potential vulnerability of coastal area only due to the human presence is the topic of the geo-spatial model proposed in this work. At this aim, a dataset of urban areas and population of last 200 years was used to assess the trend of these two factors and four vulnerability indices: urban density, population density, occupied buildings density and buildings surplus. The urban density and population density indices communicate the human pressure due to the presence of men while occupied buildings density and buildings surplus indices identify the zones where accommodation measures, as land use changes, could be applied to improve the coastal system adaptive capacity. This model was implemented at both municipality and censual administrative unit scales and it is well transferable to other areas exposed to hazard, allowing a comparison among regions. The method was applied to the case study of Volturno coastal plain (VCP), located in the north-western zone of Campania Plain (Southern Italy): indeed, the exposure to many natural hazards (coastal erosion, marine inundation, subsidence, salt water intrusion) coupled with the intense urbanization make the VCP a good test area to validate the methodology here proposed. The model evidenced a low constant value of population growth and the achievement of a sill for the urban development after the nineties, moreover the greatest part of censual districts close to the VCP shoreline have a high percentage of total unoccupied buildings.

2106,Bistability of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf Cavity Circulation and Basal Melt,"Hazel, JE; Stewart, AL","Circulation and water mass transformation within the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) cavity create precursors to Antarctic bottom water, which closes the global overturning circulation. This water mass transformation is contingent upon a relative low rate of FRIS basal melt, currently around 100-200Gt/yr. Previous studies have indicated that Antarctic climate changes may induce intrusions of warm modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) and an order-of-magnitude increase in basal melt, and signatures of mWDW have recently been observed along the face of the FRIS. However, it remains unclear how changes in near-Antarctic climate translate mechanistically to changes in mWDW access to the FRIS cavity. In this study a regional model is developed to investigate FRIS circulation dependence on local atmospheric state. Experiments with modified initial cavity conditions but identical atmospheric states yield bistable ""warm"" and ""cold"" FRIS cavity states, with an order-of-magnitude difference in basal melt rates. Idealized atmospheric perturbation experiments reveal that relatively modest perturbations to the katabatic winds shift the FRIS cavity between ""warm"" and ""cold"" states, which occur when the FRIS cavity is filled by mWDW or High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), respectively. The authors present a conceptual model in which the FRIS cavity state is determined by whether mWDW or HSSW is denser and thus floods the cavity; these states are bistable because the basal melt rate feeds back on the salinity of HSSW. These findings highlight a key role for the katabatic winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and other Antarctic ice shelves.Plain Language Summary The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is Antarctica's largest floating glacier and is the source of the ocean's densest waters. Previous studies have predicted that warmer waters from offshore may flow beneath the FRIS in the future, elevating its melt rate and suppressing formation of dense waters. In this study, the controls on this warm water inflow are investigated using simulations of the southern Weddell Sea (WS), imposing various perturbations to the atmospheric winds and temperature. The ocean beneath the FRIS is found to be ""bistable"": Depending on its initial conditions, the ocean beneath the FRIS adjusts either to a ""cold"" state in which it is filled by waters originating from the WS continental shelf or to a ""warm"" state in which it is filled by waters originating from offshore. A switch between warm and cold states can be forced by changing the winds that blow northward over the FRIS; together with FRIS meltwater, these winds influence the density of cold waters formed on the WS continental shelf. These findings highlight a key role for offshore winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and indicate that existing dense waters beneath ice shelves may buffer against future intrusions of warm water.",2020,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,125,4,,WOS:000534476600011,10.1029/2019JC015848,,#20189,Hazel 2020,,

Closed time of the sluice gate creates a good condition for sand bar formation at the channel entrance under the action of waves. Basing on the conditions of waves and water depth at the entrance of the Takase Flood Diversion Channel as well as combination with the classification of sand bar formation in the previous researches (Nguyen (2005), (2006) and Tanaka (2005)), a demarcation between emergence and submergence of sand bar formation was proposed via the dimensionless water depth at the mouth. This paper shows that emerged sand bar forms certainly at the channel entrance in the winter with a present river mouth depth. In order to limit influences of sand bar on the operation of the channel entrance, water depth at the entrance should be larger as a result sand bar forming under the water level, when sluice gate is opened, the flow in the channel could flush the bar easily.",2010,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS, VOL 2",,,45-+,WOS:000275691800007,,,#20192,Nguyen 2010,,

Moreover, climate change could impact large numbers of contaminated sites, yet there remains little research on the potential impacts for remediation. This study examined phytoremediation at a brownfield redevelopment in the San Francisco Bay area, where thousands of cleanup sites are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to determine both primary and secondary impacts and the system's resilience to various sea level scenarios and hydroclimatic conditions was investigated. It was found that the phytoremediation project rendered only a small environmental footprint, and was associated with low cost and substantial socioeconomic benefits. For instance, it fitted well with the site redevelopment setting by offering attractive landscape features. Moreover, under a modeled moderate sea level rise scenario, the groundwater hydraulic gradient at the site decreased, which was coupled with greater natural biodegradation and reduced plume migration, and, therefore, lower life cycle impact. There was also minimal increase in the vapor intrusion risk with increased sea level.

2110,Simulation of Water and Salts Dynamics in Bouhajla (Central Tunisia): Exceptional Rainfall Effect,"Kanzari, S; Hachicha, M; Bouhlila, R; Battle-Sales, J","Arid and semi-arid regions face the risk of soils and aquifers salinization. Rainy events are rare which is characteristic of these regions. They play a significant role in the leaching of salts from topsoil to deeper layers, which increases the risk of aquifers salinization. For this reason, a plot was selected in the semi-arid region of Bou Hajla (Central Tunisia). The simulation of water and salts dynamics was carried out by Hydrus-1D. Model calibration was realised on a flood irrigation experiment during 10 days and in a depth of 4 m. The hydrodynamic parameters were determined by inverse modelling. Model validation was performed successfully during 577 days. The simulation of water and salts dynamics has allowed the analysis of two scenarios: (1) the effect of a very rainy event (> 50mm/day) on the dynamics of salts. This type of event allows leaching of the accumulated salts in the topsoil which promotes their burial in the depth; (ii) the long-term evolution of the saline profile in 20 years showed the cyclical nature of salts leaching in the topsoil, the permanent accumulation of salts in the depth of around 2 m, and a continuous leaching in the deeper layers (around 4 m), which may increase groundwater contamination risk.",2012,,SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH,7,1,36-44,WOS:000310182000005,10.17221/17/2011-SWR,,#20196,Kanzari 2012,,
2115,Challenges in Coupling Acidity and Salinity Transport in Porous Media,"McNeece, CJ; Hesse, MA","Salinity is an increasingly prescient issue in reactive transport, from low salinity water flooding to fracking brine leakage. Of primary concern is the effect of salinity on surface chemistry. Transport and batch experiments show a strong coupling of salinity and acidity through chemical interactions at the mineralliquid interface. This coupling is ascribed to the combined effects of ionic strength on electrostatic behavior of the interface and competitive sorption between protons and other cations for binding sites on the surface. The effect of these mechanisms is well studied in batch settings and readily describes observed behavior. In contrast, the transport literature is sparse, primarily applied to synthetic materials, and offers only qualitative agreement with observations. To address, this gap in knowledge, we conduct a suite of column flood experiments through silica sand, systematically varying salinity and acidity conditions. Experiments are compared to a reactive transport model incorporating the proposed coupling mechanisms. The results highlight the difficulty in applying such models to realistic media under both basic and acidic conditions with a single set of parameters. The analysis and experimental results show the observed error is the result of electrostatic assumptions within the surface chemistry model and provide a strong constraint on further model development.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,51,20,11799-11808,WOS:000413391800035,10.1021/acs.est.7b02318,,#20206,McNeece 2017,,

With rising sea levels and decreasing freshwater availability, surface water salinization due to groundwater exfiltration is expected to increase in these low-lying areas. To counteract surface water salinization, freshwater diverted from rivers is used to flush agricultural ditches. In this paper, we demonstrate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme to control salinity and water levels in a water course while minimizing freshwater usage. A state space description of the discretized De Saint Venant and advection-dispersion equations for water and salt transport, respectively, is used as the internal model of the controller. The developed MPC scheme is tested using groundwater exfiltration data from two different representative Dutch polders. The tests demonstrate that water levels and salinity concentrations can successfully be controlled within set limits while minimizing the freshwater used.",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,112,,36-45,WOS:000453923900004,10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.11.010,,#20213,Aydin 2019,,
2121,"On the Modified Circumpolar Deep Water Upwelling Over the Four Ladies Bank in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica","Liu, CY; Wang, ZM; Cheng, C; Wu, Y; Xia, RB; Li, BR; Li, X","Analyses of hydrographic observation data sets revealed that modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) tends to flood the western flank (73-78 degrees E, 67-68 degrees S) of the Four Ladies Bank (FLB) in Prydz Bay. In this study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for mCDW upwelling over the FLB based on an eddy-resolving coupled ocean-sea ice-ice shelf model in conjunction with the latest high-accuracy bathymetry. It was found that zonal step-like declines in the seabed over the FLB are crucial for the mCDW onshore upwelling, through topographic dynamic effects on the alongshore Antarctic Slope Current. In the presence of meridional cross-shelf sigma isopycnals, warm mCDW at 500-m depth in the deep sea can make its approach to the shallower continental shelf (200- to 500-m depths), characterized as a warm layer (> -1.8 degrees C) bounded by the cross-shelf sigma isopycnal surfaces of 27.5 and 27.7kg/m(3). The simulated outflow of the Prydz Bay gyre is concentrated to the eastern flank of the Prydz Channel. These results suggest that, in addition to the depressions and troughs around the Antarctic, smaller topographic features such as step-like declines in the seabed near the Antarctic Slope Current are also favorable for onshore mCDW intrusion. This study demonstrates that mCDW onshore transport around the Antarctic continental shelf might be significantly underestimated by numerical models with coarse spatial representations of the topography.Plain Language Summary Based the observational data sets, warm Circumpolar Deep Water was identified over the Four Ladies Bank in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. The warm signals could be delivered into the ocean cavity beneath the downstream ice shelf and result in remarkable influences to the ice shelf basal melting. In order to investigate the intrusion of warm Circumpolar Deep Water, we used a numerical model to simulate the oceanic circulations in Prydz Bay. By assessing the simulated results, we found that the topographic influences of the changes in seabed on the continental shelf break jet play a dominant role in the responsible mechanism for warm water intrusion. Our findings highlighted that the improvements in the spatial resolution of the numerical model and the accuracy of the topographical representations are very useful in the investigation of warm water intrusion around the Antarctic continental shelf.",2018,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,123,11,7819-7838,WOS:000453907000010,10.1029/2018JC014026,,#20216,Liu 2018,,
2123,Urbanization and aridity mediate distinct salinity response to floods in rivers and streams across the contiguous United States,"Ombadi, M; Varadharajan, C","Salinity is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and the use of freshwaters for industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial purposes. Although a number of studies have investigated the variability and trends of salinity in rivers and streams, the effects of floods on salinity across a wide range of watersheds have not been determined. Here, we examine this question by utilizing long-term observational records of daily streamflow and specific conductance (SC; a proxy for salinity) in addition to catchment characteristics for 259 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites in the contiguous United States spanning a wide range of climatic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. We used a combination of statistical methods, random forest machine learning models, and information-theoretic causal inference algorithms to determine the response of SC to floods and the factors that impact salinity changes within sites (intra-site variability) and across sites (inter-site variability). Our results show that changes to SC during flood events exhibited substantial variability ranging from a 100% decrease to 34% increase relative to the long-term mean. We found that dilution is the prevailing mechanism that decreases SC levels during floods for most sites, but other mechanisms caused an increase of SC for 6.1% (n = 5521) of flood events. Our analysis revealed that antecedent conditions of SC in the few days preceding the flood are the most important factor in explaining intrasite variability. The response of salinity to floods also varied considerably across sites with different characteristics, with a notable effect of urbanization in temperate climates resulting in increased dilution of SC, and mining in arid climates, which adversely increases SC levels. Overall, we find that the combined effect of aridity and anthropogenic factors is of primary importance in determining how salinity responds to floods, and it bears strongly on water quality conditions in a future world - one in which floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity, concurrent with shifting aridity patterns and increasing urbanization.",2022,,WATER RESEARCH,220,,,WOS:000810441600002,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118664,,#20222,Ombadi 2022,,

It involves the construction of large sediment and freshwater impoundments between the river and coastline fed periodically through large spillway structures during the rising hydrograph of the river when the highest concentration of sediment is in the water column. Sediment directing and trapping technologies are proposed for the river channel and spillways to capture the coarser-grained sediments. The embankments can be constructed from dredging and then enlarged by land-based harvesting of coarse-grained sediments from the traps. These impoundments will permit the continuous introduction of freshwater and finer-grained sediments to coastal marshlands for vegetation, land augmentation, protection from storm surges and salt water intrusion, while removing large amounts of sand from the river and decreasing annual maintenance dredging costs.",2014,,SEDIMENT DYNAMICS FROM THE SUMMIT TO THE SEA,367,,429-434,WOS:000357222000056,,,#20224,Andersen 2014,,
2128,Exchange Flows in Tributary Creeks Enhance Dispersion by Tidal Trapping,"Garcia, AMP; Geyer, WR; Randall, N","The North River estuary (Massachusetts, USA) is a tidal marsh creek network where tidal dispersion processes dominate the salt balance. A field study using moorings, shipboard measurements, and drone surveys was conducted to characterize and quantify tidal trapping due to tributary creeks. During flood tide, saltwater propagates up the main channel and gets ""trapped"" in the creeks. The creeks inherit an axial salinity gradient from the time-varying salinity at their boundary with the main channel, but it is stronger than the salinity gradient of the main channel because of relatively weaker currents. The stronger salinity gradient drives a baroclinic circulation that stratifies the creeks, while the main channel remains well-mixed. Because of the creeks' shorter geometries, tidal currents in the creeks lead those in the main channel; therefore, the creeks never fill with the saltiest water which passes the main channel junction. This velocity phase difference is enhanced by the exchange flow in the creeks, which fast-tracks the fresher surface layer in the creeks back to the main channel. Through ebb tide, the relatively fresh creek outflows introduce a negative salinity anomaly into the main channel, where it is advected downstream by the tide. Using high-resolution measurements, we empirically determine the salinity anomaly in the main channel resulting from its exchange with the creeks to calculate a dispersion rate due to trapping. Our dispersion rate is larger than theoretical estimates that neglect the exchange flow in the creeks. Trapping contributes more than half the landward salt flux in this region.",2022,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,45,2,363-381,WOS:000673099000001,10.1007/s12237-021-00969-4,,#20235,Garcia 2022,,
2129,Cycles of passive versus active diapirism recorded along an exposed salt wall,"Alsop, GI; Weinberger, R; Levi, T; Marco, S","Although it has long been recognised that passive salt diapirism may encompass sub-ordinate cycles of active diapirism, where sedimentary overburden is periodically shed off the roof of the rising salt, there has been very little study of this process around exposed salt (halite) diapirs. However, the Late Miocene-Pliocene Sedom salt wall, on the western side of the Dead Sea Basin, presents an opportunity for detailed outcrop analysis of diapiric salt and the associated depositional and deformational record of its movement during both passive and active phases of diapirism. The sub-seismic scale record of diapirism includes sedimentary breccia horizons interpreted to reflect sediments being shed off the crest of the growing salt wall, together with exceptional preservation of rotated unconformities and growth faults. Areas of more pronounced dips directed towards the salt wall are capped by unconformities, and interpreted to represent withdrawal basins within the overburden that extend for at least 1500 m from the salt margin. Elsewhere, broad areas of upturn directed away from the salt extend for up to 1250 m and are marked by a sequence of rotated unconformities which are interpreted to bound halokinetic sequences. The margins of the salt wall are defined by steep extensional boundary faults that cut upturned strata, and have enabled rapid and active uplift of the salt since the Holocene. The Sedom salt wall therefore charts the transition from passive growth marked by withdrawal basins, growth faults and unconformities, to more active intrusion associated with major boundary faults that enable the rapid uplift of overburden deposited on top of the salt to similar to 100 m above regional elevations in the past 43 ka. Individual cycles of passive and active diapirism occur over timescales of <30 ka, which is up to an order of magnitude less than typically suggested for other settings, and highlights the dynamic interplay between salt tectonics and sedimentation in an environment undergoing rapid fluctuations in water level.

2130,Optimization of pumping rate and recharge through numerical modeling with special reference to small coral island aquifer,"Banerjee, P; Singh, VS","The groundwater is the only source of availability of fresh water in tiny coral islands. In the past decades, there has been growing demand for fresh water to meet the need of domestic besides other purposes. The aquifer system on these islands is fragile besides being subjected to various stresses like high subsurface discharge, increased abstraction, improper disposal of waste water and tidal waves of ocean all of which subject the aquifer prone to sea water intrusion and thus reduction and deterioration the water quality. Therefore, understanding the aquifer's behavior and then work out a sustainable option for fresh water is essential.The paper concerns optimizing of pumping and artificial recharge paces to reduce the effects of various stresses over tiny and fragile lens-shaped coral island aquifer system. The density driven ground water flow was simulated using SEAWAT (MODFLOW and MT3D based computer program) model. Detailed hydrogeological investigations were carried out to determine the quantity of freshwater that could be pumped to avoid the seawater intrusion into the aquifer through modeling. Initial heads, physical parameters and boundary conditions of the study area have been defined in the model based on field data, geophysical measurements and interpretations and hydrogeological studies. The model was calibrated by obtaining a match of computed and observed values of the water table, as hydraulic head is much more sensitive to pumping rates than any other stress. A few sentences about: flow model were utilized to derive optimal pumping rate; the effect of artificial recharge through the model, has also proved that the salt-water intrusion could be stopped by raising the water level through temporarily storing the artificially recharged water post construction of subsurface dam near the coast.

2131,Impacts of warm water on Antarctic ice shelf stability through basal channel formation,"Alley, KE; Scambos, TA; Siegfried, MR; Fricker, HA","Antarctica's ice shelves provide resistance to the flow of grounded ice towards the ocean. If this resistance is decreased as a result of ice shelf thinning or disintegration(1), acceleration of grounded ice can occur, increasing rates of sea-level rise. Loss of ice shelf mass is accelerating, especially in West Antarctica, where warm seawater is reaching ocean cavities beneath ice shelves(2). Here we use satellite imagery, airborne ice-penetrating radar and satellite laser altimetry spanning the period from 2002 to 2014 to map extensive basal channels in the ice shelves surrounding Antarctica. The highest density of basal channels is found in West Antarctic ice shelves. Within the channels, warm water flows northwards, eroding the ice shelf base and driving channel evolution on annual to decadal timescales. Our observations show that basal channels are associated with the development of new zones of crevassing, suggesting that these channels may cause ice fracture. We conclude that basal channels can form and grow quickly as a result of warm ocean water intrusion, and that they can structurally weaken ice shelves, potentially leading to rapid ice shelf loss in some areas.",2016,,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,9,4,290-+,WOS:000373374100013,10.1038/NGEO2675,,#20241,Alley 2016,,
2132,"The Springtime Influence of Natural Tropical Pacific Variability on the Surface Climate of the Ross Ice Shelf, West Antarctica: Implications for Ice Shelf Thinning","Clem, KR; Orr, A; Pope, JO","Observational records starting in the 1950s show West Antarctica is amongst the most rapidly warming regions on the planet. Together with increased intrusions of warm circumpolar deep water (CDW) onto the continental shelf due to local wind forcing (the primary mechanism in recent decades), this has resulted in enhanced surface and basal melting of floating ice shelves and an associated acceleration and thinning of West Antarctic outlet glaciers, increasing the rate of global sea level rise. In this study, it is shown that during the austral spring season, significant surface warming across West Antarctica has shifted westward to the Ross Ice Shelf in recent decades in response to enhanced cyclonic circulation over the Ross Sea. These circulation changes are caused by a Rossby wave train forced by increasing sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific, which is tied to the springtime shift of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) to its negative phase after 1992. While the local wind trends enhance warm air advection and surface warming across the Ross Ice Shelf, the strong easterly component of the wind trends reduces the likelihood for intrusions of CDW onto the continental shelf in this region. This suggests that during spring there are competing mechanisms of surface and basal melting of the Ross Ice Shelf, both of which are closely tied to natural tropical Pacific decadal variability. Moreover, that the projected transition of the IPO back to its positive phase in the coming decade, though likely to reduce surface warming on the Ross Ice Shelf, could increase the risk of disintegration of Ross Sea ice shelves due to increased intrusions of CDW and enhanced basal melting.",2018,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,8,,,WOS:000441300700027,10.1038/s41598-018-30496-5,,#20243,Clem 2018,,
2137,Salinization of urbanizing New Hampshire streams and groundwater: effects of road salt and hydrologic variability,"Daley, ML; Potter, JD; McDowell, WH","Since the 1940s, use of road salt as a deicing agent has increased substantially in regions of the US with cold winters. Despite its ubiquitous application and known negative consequences for aquatic and human health, little research has documented the effects of road salt on the water quality of either streams or groundwater in regions, such as New Hampshire (NH), with harsh northern climates. We measured stream Na+ and Cl- concentrations in 44 basins spanning a gradient of urbanization in southeastern and central NH. Among all sampled basins, stream Na+ and Cl- concentrations were highly correlated with basin % road pavement (r(2) = 0.75 for Na+, and 0.78 for Cl-). In southeastern NH, concentrations also were correlated strongly with % impervious surface (r(2) = 0.86 for Na+, and 0.92 for Cl-). Groundwater salt concentrations in 143 private wells were significantly correlated with % impervious surface within a 500-m radius of each well, but the proportion of explained variance was small (r(2) = 0.07 for Na+, and 0.10 for Cl-). Concentrations of salt in streams and groundwater were surprisingly high. Mean concentrations of Na+ ranged from <1 to 298 mg/L and of Cl- ranged from <1 to 573 mg/L. Mean Cl- concentration in I small stream exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic toxicity standard of 230 mg/L, and 9% of groundwater samples exceeded the secondary EPA maximum contamination levels for drinking water (250 mg/L of either Na+ or Cl-). In our long-term study basin, the Lamprey River, specific conductance increased over the period from 1978 to 2008, a result that indicated a corresponding increase in Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Both Na+ and Cl- concentrations in the Lamprey River were negatively correlated with flow, but the slope of the relationship decreased after a significant flood in 2006. Our data suggest that road-salting practices are contributing to the salinization of stream water and groundwater in NH, and that hydrologic variability, which is predicted to increase with climate change, could strongly affect the degree of salinization observed in surface waters.",2009,,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,28,4,929-940,WOS:000273886000015,10.1899/09-052.1,,#20252,Daley 2009,,
2140,Salinity Effects from Evaporation and Transpiration under Flood Irrigation,"van den Akker, J; Simmons, CT; Hutson, JL","Transpiration and evaporation rates from irrigated pastures can be adequately assessed by conventional methods and more recently, by the use of stable isotopes delta H-2 and delta O-18. However, the salinity effects that transpiration and evaporation have on infiltrating irrigation waters and residual soil-waters have not been independently assessed in a flood irrigation setting. In this study, oxygen-18, deuterium and chloride concentrations of irrigation water, soil-water, and groundwater were monitored with soil-water content over time to independently assess the salinization effects of evaporation and transpiration. This study was carried out across four flood irrigation sites that overlie a heterogeneous loam-sand and limestone vadose zone. Results showed that minor evaporation losses were detected across most flood irrigation sites through the use of stable isotopes delta H-2 and delta O-18. The associated increase in chloride concentration of irrigation water as a result of evaporation (minor fractionating water loss) was low (0 mg/l to 129 mg/l) compared to the chloride increase as a result of transpiration (150 mg/l to 2,800 mg/l) noted in shallow soil-water. Across all sites, the fractionating water loss detected in soil-water was minor (< 1% delta O-18 from the source) with isotopic signatures reflecting partially evaporated irrigation waters. The high soil-water chloride concentrations, minor fractionating loss, and corresponding decrease in soil-water content suggest that transpiration is the dominant cause of water loss and therefore the largest contributor to salinity effects during flood irrigation. Salinity effects caused by transpiration (0.4 to 2.6 t/ha) were 3 to 50 times greater than the salinity effects caused by evaporation from irrigation and soil-waters (0.01 to 0.3 t/ha).

The stratification was controlled by the advection of the salt wedge and was strengthened during the flood tide and weakened during the ebb tide. This phenomenon is the opposite of systems that are dominated by tidal straining of salinity, which diminishes the stratification during the flood tide and enhances it during the ebb tide. The enhanced stratification during the flood tide restricts turbulent mixing; hence, the resuspended sediment is concentrated below the pycnocline. Because of the stronger turbulent mixing during the ebb tide, the suspended sediment can be elevated to the surface, decreasing the near-bottom SSC. Such tidal asymmetries of mixing and near-bottom SSC cause the net sediment flux to be directed landward in the lower layers after a tidal cycle.",2015,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,31,3,671-679,WOS:000354074400015,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00186.1,,#20265,Li 2015,,

Increases in salt, dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic nutrients have been attributed to changes in atmospheric deposition, road salt and fertilizer application, and urbanization. Extremely large flood events, which are increasing in frequency and duration, could also alter river chemistry by flushing various solute reservoirs within watersheds and effectively resetting the linkages between land and river. We evaluated changes in concentrations and fluxes of inorganic nutrients, dissolved organic matter, and salts and major ions across 12 to 15years in a rural-suburban watershed in New Hampshire, USA. During this period, the human imprint on the landscape (impervious surfaces and population density) increased, but two 100-year flood events also occurred. We found that concentrations and fluxes of chloride and potassium, fluxes of all other major ions, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon declined over time, but concentrations and fluxes of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic nitrogen were unchanged. The minor declines in concentrations were of similar magnitude to declines previously observed in other watersheds that did not experience extreme flood events. We observed a shift in nitrate (NO3-) concentration-discharge behavior from enrichment in the years prior to and including the floods to chemostasis after the floods, but for both time periods NO3- concentrations were weakly related to discharge.

2154,Thermohaline stratification modeling in mine water via double-diffusive convection for geothermal energy recovery from flooded mines,"Bao, T; Liu, Z","This study addresses a key scientific issue that remains unresolved in the past three decades for recovering geothermal energy from flooded mines. This issue is that no scientific explanation is available for the layering phenomenon of both temperature and salinity in large bodies of subterranean water (e.g., mine water), i.e., thermohaline stratification, which is commonly observed in mine water. Such a layering phenomenon, however, is very significant to the geothermal application by determining the temperature distribution and consequently the energy reserve and efficiency. For this purpose, multiphysics simulation with unique non-isothermal and non-isosolutal hydrodynamics is adopted to predict the formation and evolution of thermohaline stratifications in large bodies of mine water. The multiphysics simulation, for the first time, succeeded in reproducing the formation and evolution of thermohaline stratifications with a theory assuming lateral double-diffusive intrusions to mine water. The simulation results revealed that the evolution of thermohaline stratifications involves the layer-merging event, in which several small layers gradually merge to form layers with a larger thickness. The results also indicated that the buoyancy ratio is a key parameter for producing clear thermohaline stratifications in large bodies of mine water and its critical value was suggested to be 1.0. To successfully reproduce thermohaline stratifications, the required condition was concluded to be the lateral heat flux with a difference between the lateral heat fluxes, while the lateral salinity flux was not required. It is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the layering phenomenon in large-scale subterranean water bodies has been successfully reproduced and explained scientifically. This study will provide a solid scientific basis for the efficient and sustainable use of large bodies of subterranean water in flooded mines for geothermal energy recovery.",2019,,APPLIED ENERGY,237,,566-580,WOS:000459845100045,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.049,,#20272,Bao 2019,,

Meanwhile, climate changes are already underway, and will continue to some degree even if emissions are drastically curtailed, thanks to emissions already in the atmosphere. Some countries and states are making their own plans to adapt to expected impacts including higher sea levels, more intense rainfall, droughts, heat waves, and loss of water supplies-and to reduce their local emissions.

2160,"Occurrence of Microplastic Pollution at Oyster Reefs and Other Coastal Sites in the Mississippi Sound, USA: Impacts of Freshwater Inflows from Flooding","Scircle, A; Cizdziel, JV; Tisinger, L; Anumol, T; Robey, D","Much of the seafood that humans consume comes from estuaries and coastal areas where microplastics (MPs) accumulate, due in part to continual input and degradation of plastic litter from rivers and runoff. As filter feeders, oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are especially vulnerable to MP pollution. In this study, we assessed MP pollution in water at oyster reefs along the Mississippi Gulf Coast when: (1) historic flooding of the Mississippi River caused the Bonnet Carre Spillway to remain open for a record period of time causing major freshwater intrusion to the area and deleterious impacts on the species and (2) the spillway was closed, and normal salinity conditions resumed. Microplastics (similar to 25 mu m-5 mm) were isolated using a single-pot method, preparing samples in the same vessel (Mason jars) used for their collection right up until the MPs were transferred onto filters for analyses. The MPs were quantified using Nile Red fluorescence detection and identified using laser direct infrared (LDIR) analysis. Concentrations ranged from similar to 12 to 381 particles/L and tended to decrease at sites impacted by major freshwater intrusion. With the spillway open, average MP concentrations were positively correlated with salinity (r = 0.87, p = 0.05) for sites with three or more samples examined. However, the dilution effect on MP abundances was temporary, and oyster yields suffered from the extended periods of lower salinity. There were no significant changes in the relative distribution of MPs during freshwater intrusions; most of the MPs (>50%) were in the lower size fraction (similar to 25-90 mu m) and consisted mostly of fragments (similar to 84%), followed by fibers (similar to 11%) and beads (similar to 5%). The most prevalent plastic was polyester, followed by acrylates/polyurethanes, polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyacetal. Overall, this work provides much-needed empirical data on the abundances, morphologies, and types of MPs that oysters are exposed to in the Mississippi Sound, although how much of these MPs are ingested and their impacts on the organisms deserves further scrutiny. This paper is believed to be the first major application of LDIR to the analysis of MPs in natural waters.",2020,,TOXICS,8,2,,WOS:000551230300006,10.3390/toxics8020035,,#20285,Scircle 2020,,

Soil cores containing uniform plants of S.scirpoides were subjected to drained, 1/3 flooded, alternately flooded and drained at weekly intervals, and continuously flooded treatments for 6months. Mean soil redox potential of the drained soil was 22529mV and was significantly lower in the other treatments. Total dry biomass, above-ground biomass and number of culms in the flooded/drained and flooded treatments were significantly higher than those in the drained and 1/3 flooded treatments. Below-ground/above-ground biomass ratios were highest in the drained treatment and significantly lower in the waterlogged treatments. Plant height and the growth rate of culms were least in the drained treatment and significantly higher in the other treatments. Culm specific gravity decreased significantly with increase in soil moisture. In the field study, soil redox potentials were moderately reduced in the inland and streamside sites, while culm elongation rate was significantly higher by 94% in the streamside compared with the inland site.

Classical methods of observational data analysis of hourly and nearly synoptic observations and analytical simulations of nearly steady-state salinity and longitudinal velocity profiles were used. During the neap tidal cycle the flood (v<0) and ebb (v>0) velocities varied in the range of -0.20 m/s to 0.30 m/s associated with a small salinity variation from surface to bottom (26.4 psu to 30.7 psu). In the spring tidal cycle the velocities increased and varied in the range of -0.40 m/s to 0.45 m/s, but the salinity stratification remained almost unaltered. The steady-state salinity and velocity profiles simulated with an analytical model presented good agreement (Skill near 1.0), in comparison with the observational profiles. During the transitional fortnightly tidal modulation period there was no changes in the channel classification (type 2a - partially mixed and weakly stratified), because the potential energy rate was to low to enhance the halocline erosion. These results, associated with the high water column vertical stability (RiL > 20) and the low estuarine Richardson number (RiE = 1.6), lead to the conclusions: i) the driving mechanism for the estuary circulation and mixing was mainly balanced by the fresh water discharge and the tidal forcing associated with the baroclinic component of the gradient pressure force; ii) there was no changes in the thermohaline and circulation characteristics due to the forthnigtly tidal modulation; and iii) the nearly steady-state of the vertical salinity and velocity profiles were well simulated with a theoretical classical analytical model.",2012,,BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY,60,1,11-23,WOS:000304201600002,10.1590/S1679-87592012000100002,,#20289,deMiranda 2012,,
2164,Linking the Surface and Subsurface in River Deltas-Part 1: Relating Surface and Subsurface Geometries,"Hariharan, J; Xu, ZY; Michael, HA; Paola, C; Steel, E; Passalacqua, P","River deltas are densely populated regions of the world with vulnerable groundwater reserves. Contamination of these groundwater aquifers via saline water intrusion and pollutant transport is a growing threat due to both anthropogenic and climate changes. The arrangement and composition of subsurface sediment is known to have a significant impact on aquifer contamination; however, developing accurate depictions of the subsurface is challenging. In this work, we explore the relationship between surface and subsurface properties and identify the metrics most sensitive to different forcing conditions. To do so, we simulate river delta evolution with the rule-based numerical model, DeltaRCM, and test the influence of input sand fraction and steady sea level rise (SLR) on delta evolution. From the model outputs, we measure a variety of surface and subsurface metrics chosen based on their applicability to imagery and modeling results. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is then used to quantitatively gauge which metrics are most indicative of the imposed forcings. Both qualitative observations and the KL divergence analysis suggest that estimates of subsurface connectivity can be constrained using surface information. In particular, more variable shoreline roughness values and higher surface wetted fraction values correspond to increased subsurface connectivity. These findings complement traditional methods of estimating subsurface structure in river-dominated delta systems and represent a step toward the identification of a direct link between surface observations and subsurface form.",2021,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,57,8,,WOS:000688205400011,10.1029/2020WR029282,,#20291,Hariharan 2021,,

It has two different types of aquifers: (1) an unconfined upper limestone aquifer with groundwater level ranges between 800 and 160 m above sea level (asp, and (2) a confined lower sandstone aquifer with groundwater level ranges between 340 and -260 m asl. The two aquifers are separated by a marly aquiclude. The salinity in the carbonate aquifer ranges from 500 to 1500 mu S cm(-1), while the salinity in the sandstone aquifer is between 1.7 and 4.1 mS cm(-1). There is a major strike slip fault in the middle and lower part of the Wadi that passes perpendicularly through the two aquifers and the aquiclude layer with embedded normal faults. The aim of the study was to specify the origin, genesis, and development of the salinization of groundwaters, as a result of the major fault zone. It was found that the embedded normal form conduit connections produce a third groundwater type as a result of up-rising mixing. Therefore three groundwater types are generated in the flow as follows: (1) Alkaline - earth water predominantly bicarbonate (water group A) in the upper aquifer. (2) Alkaline - earth water predominantly sulphate (water group B) in the mixing zone.

A 2D hydrodynamics numerical model of the Changjiang Estuary was set up using Delft3D-FLOW. The calculation results are consistent well with the real measured data, which indicates that the model can be used in hydrodynamic analysis. Simulation results show that the ebb water split ratio of the North Branch in the flood season is larger than that in the dry season, while the situation of the South Branch is opposite.

In the present study, grain sizes were measured from surface sediments collected in the Pearl River Estuary and its adjacent coastal areas. End-member modeling analysis attempts to unmix the grain sizes into geologically meaningful populations. Six grain-size end-members were identified. Their dominant modes are 0 I broken vertical bar, 1.5 I broken vertical bar, 2.75 I broken vertical bar, 4.5 I broken vertical bar, 7 I broken vertical bar, and 8 I broken vertical bar, corresponding to coarse sand, medium sand, fine sand, very coarse silt, silt, and clay, respectively. The spatial distributions of the six end-members are influenced by sediment transport and depositional processes. The two coarsest end-members (coarse sand and medium sand) may reflect relict sediments deposited during the last glacial period. The fine sand end-member would be difficult to transport under fair weather conditions, and likely indicates storm deposits. The three remaining fine-grained end-members (very coarse silt, silt, and clay) are recognized as suspended particles transported by saltwater intrusion via the flood tidal current, the Guangdong Coastal Current, and riverine outflow. The grain-size trend analysis shows distinct transport patterns for the three fine-grained end-members. The landward transport of the very coarse silt end-member occurs in the eastern part of the estuary, the seaward transport of the silt end-member occurs in the western part, and the east-west transport of the clay end-member occurs in the coastal areas. The results show that grain-size end-member modeling analysis in combination with sediment trend analysis help to better understand sediment transport patterns and the associated transport mechanisms.",2018,,GEO-MARINE LETTERS,38,2,167-178,WOS:000427469300006,10.1007/s00367-017-0518-2,,#20304,Li 2018,,
2175,"Tidal variations of flow convergence, shear, and stratification at the Rio de la Plata estuary turbidity front","Framinan, MB; Valle-Levinson, A; Sepulveda, HH; Brown, OB","Intratidal variability of density and velocity fields is investigated at the turbidity front of the Rio de la Plata Estuary, South America. Current velocity and temperature-salinity profiles collected in August 1999 along a repeated transect crossing the front are analyzed. Horizontal and vertical gradients, stability of the front, convergence zones, and transverse flow associated to the frontal boundary are described. Strong horizontal convergence of the across-front velocity and build up of along-front velocity shear were observed at the front. In the proximity of the front, enhanced transverse (or along-front) flow created jet-like structures at the surface and near the bottom flowing in opposite directions. These structures persisted throughout the tidal cycle and were advected upstream (downstream) by the flood (ebb) current through a distance of similar to 10 km. During peak flood, the upper layer flow reversed from its predominant downstream direction and upstreamflow occupied the entire water column; outside the peak flood, two-layer estuarine circulation dominated. Changes in density field were observed in response to tidal straining, tidal advection, and wind-induced mixing, but stratification remained throughout the tidal cycle. This work demonstrates the large spatial variability of the velocity field at the turbidity front; it provides evidence of enhanced transverse circulation along the frontal boundary; and reveals the importance of advective and frictional intratidal processes in the dynamics of the central part of the estuary.",2008,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,113,C8,,WOS:000258648000001,10.1029/2006JC004038,,#20306,Framinan 2008,,

This unique topographic feature leads to different dynamics of the subtidal estuarine circulation (SEC) in the PRE compared with a narrow and straight estuary. In this study, the nonlinear dynamics of the SEC in the PRE under mean circumstance are analyzed by using a validated 3D numerical model. Model results show that the nonlinear advections reach leading order in the along-channel momentum balance. Modulated by tide, the nonlinear advections show significant temporal variations as they have much larger values during spring tide than that during neap tide. Unlike straight and narrow estuaries, both tidally and cross-sectionally averaged axial and lateral advections play important roles in driving the SEC in the PRE in which the axial advection dominates the nonlinear effect, but the two nonlinear terms balance each other largely resulting in a reduced nonlinear effect. Despite this, the total nonlinear advection is still comparable with other terms, and it acts as the baroclinic pressure to reinforce the SEC, especially during the ebb tide, suggesting a flood-ebb asymmetry of the nonlinear dynamics in the PRE. In addition, diagnostic analyses of the along-channel vorticity budget show that nonlinear advections also make significant contribution to drive the lateral circulation in the PRE as Coriolis and baroclinic pressure terms, indicating complex dynamics of the circulation in the PRE.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000663817300001,10.3389/fmars.2021.629403,,#20308,Xu 2021,,

Taking the Yangtze Estuary as an example, firstly, its sediment transport forms many circles both in longitudinal sections and transverse sections. Secondly, its sediment trapping is controlled by two different mechanisms, tidal current and salt water. The former contains the delay effect of sediment deposition and incipient motion, the asymmetry of flood and ebb, and the separation of flood and ebb, whereas the latter includes the influence of the saltwater wedge density current, the aggregation of the saltwater intrusion fronts, and the trapping of flocculation.

Results showed obvious characterisation related to physical and hydrological setting, and highly variable spatial differences reflecting the complexities of these areas. All these coastal waters are dominated by Na-Cl and fall on a common dilution line; hydrochemical grouping is largely due to anionic differences (Cl, SO4 and HCO3), although Na and Mg ratios also vary. Six major hydrochemical facies were determined. For groundwaters, compositional differences are largely related to aquifer material and level of confinement; for coastal groundwaters important are tidal effects and proximity to the shoreline. Differentiation for surface waters is mainly by drainage morphology, flow regime plus proximity to the coast. Connectivity between water bodies is reflected by minor base flow to catchment streams, including with flood plain wetlands, but mostly occurs in low-lying zones where there is mixing of fresh and saline water within surface water and subterranean estuaries, or by seawater intrusion enhanced by overuse. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data for confined and semi-confined groundwaters along the coast indicates local recharge; fresh surface waters in the elevated catchments are shown to be sourced further inland plus have experienced evaporation.",2011,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,64,7,1885-1909,WOS:000296737700018,10.1007/s12665-011-1003-2,,#20313,Larsen 2011,,

These were compared to similar experiments conducted in the wet season of 2005 in the far northern GBR (14 degrees S). Seasonality (wet and dry season) was the greatest determinant of respiration rate, with median CR values of 1.85 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in the dry season and 2.87 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in the wet season. NCP normally ranged up to 9.16 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1), depending on depth and phytoplankton biomass, though an extreme value of 14.96 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) occurred during flood conditions. Cross-shelf effects had a strong influence on physicochemical variables but weaker effects on both CR and NCP, though both were higher inshore. All but two stations were net autotrophic, with a median ratio of gross primary production : CR of 1.5. Area-specific CR was 72 +/- 23 standard deviation (SD) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in the dry season and 94 +/- 27 SD mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in the wet season. Area-specific NCP was lower in the dry season (41 +/- 33 SD mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) than in the wet season (55 +/- 54 SD mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). Peaks in area-specific NCP were associated with floods, intrusions of nutrient-rich sub-thermocline Coral Sea water, and localized phytoplankton blooms but otherwise showed few seasonal or spatial trends.

Structural and compositional variables were obtained from 47 field sites. Mapping using satellite imagery illustrated differences in the character of riparian zones in terms of species composition and provided data on flood frequency. Salinity data plots show increases downstream. Results imply that woody plant variables respond to desiccation-driven change due to water-table lowering (reduced recharge) and increased salinization through distinct changes in tree and shrub height, plant density and species richness. In the wetter, intermediate distributaries, key biotic indicators of ecosystem change comprise structural variables such as decreases in canopy cover per cent and tree height and increases of shrub height, which are indicative of mainly ground-water declines. Biotic indicators in the less frequently flooded receiver channels comprise plant density and species richness increases involving mainly brackish ground-water-tolerant and dryland species which are indicative of both ground-water declines and/or salinization. These indicators could provide useful parameters for use in long- and short-term monitoring aimed at assessing desiccation-driven change in different parts of the Okavango Delta and possibly other semi-arid wetlands.

Population bomb (increasing human population) and reduction in land available for cultivation are two threats to agricultural sustainability. In this situation, demand for cultivable land increases. However, environmental degradation factors such as erratic rainfall, extreme temperatures, drought and floods, high winds, and soil salinity have affected the production and cultivation of agricultural crops. Among these, soil salinity is one of the most devastating environmental stresses, which causes major reductions in cultivated land areas, crop productivity, and quality. Soil salinity further impacts the general public, particularly farmers, through its effect on agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to find the causes of soil salinity and its impact (economic and environmental) on crop production in saline soils given the increasing farming costs.

2188,Approximate analytical solutions for assessing the effects of unsaturated flow on seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers,"Luo, ZY; Kong, J; Shen, CJ; Lu, CH; Xin, P; Werner, AD; Li, L; Barry, DA","This study develops approximate analytical solutions for seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers considering unsaturated flow, and assuming steady-state, sharp-interface conditions, for both constant flux (flux controlled aquifers) and constant head (head-controlled aquifers) inland boundary conditions. These analytical solutions were verified with numerical simulations of variable-saturation and variable-density flow. The results show that neglecting unsaturated flow underestimates the steady-state seawater extent, particularly for flux controlled aquifers. This occurs because the vadose zone transmits part of the freshwater flux towards the sea, leading to a lower watertable and, consequently, a more landward seawater extent. Larger capillary fringes accompanying finer-grained sediments (and smaller pore sizes) cause more landward locations of the interface toe for both flux-controlled and head-controlled aquifers. The ratio of the capillary fringe thickness to the saturated zone thickness controls the relative difference in the interface toe location between cases with and without unsaturated flow. When this ratio is 17.3%, the relative difference in the interface toe location is 30% for the flux-controlled aquifer (base scenario adopted in the current study).

2189,"Rapid, human-induced siltation of the macro-tidal Ord River Estuary, Western Australia","Wolanski, E; Moore, K; Spagnol, S; D'Adamo, N; Pattiaratchi, C","Field studies on the sediment dynamics of the two arms of Cambridge Gulf, tropical Western Australia, were undertaken. The system is macro-tidal with 8 m tides. The West Arm is the estuary of the Durack and Pentecost rivers, which are largely untouched by human activities. The East Arm is the estuary of the Ord River affected by land clearing which started 100 years ago, and by two river dams constructed 30 years ago. Prior to damming of the Ord River, the natural flow in all rivers was highly seasonal, characterized by small, at times negligible, flow during the dry season, which lasts eight months, and occasional river floods during the wet season, which lasts four months. The river flow has been regulated in the East Arm as a result of damming; this resulted in suppressing large river floods. The salinity intrusion length has decreased by about 50% in the East Arm following river damming. The East Arm has silted measurably over the last 30 years, with the stream cross-sectional area decreasing by about 50%. Field and numerical studies suggest that this is due to the dam-induced suppression of large river floods, which has in turn allowed a greater amount of tidal pumping of sediment into the East Arm from Cambridge Gulf. Since tidal pumping is increasing as the system is silting, the East Arm appears to now be geomorphologically unstable as a result of human activities. Numerical studies suggest it may take as little as 100 years for the Ord River to reach a new equilibrium. Modelling suggests that this equilibrium may be characterized by a salinity intrusion length half that before damming, a channel width and depth reduced by 70%, and a much stronger tidal asymmetry characterized by an increasing size of the tidal bore. The West Arm. appears to be at equilibrium since there has been no net loss or gain of sediment for the last 111 years. Tidal dynamics and river floods appear responsible for self-scouring this channel.

2191,The age and the flushing time of the Great Barrier Reef waters,"Andutta, FP; Ridd, PV; Wolanski, E","A numerical model of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was verified using water current data from twenty sites, and applied to estimate the flushing time and age of waters. These timescales were calculated under different wind and oceanic inflow conditions. The age of oceanic waters intruding in the GBR was estimated to be between 3 and 5 months on leaving the GBR, depending on the location; the largest residence time prevailed in the southern GBR matrix where the age was the highest within the high density reef matrix, indicating veering of the mean currents around the GBR matrix. The flushing time depends on the size of the domain, and was estimated to be 67 days for the whole central GBR. For the flushing of coastal waters the wind had two effects. Firstly, it increased the flushing times by generating wind-driven currents, transporting some water back to the source; this process is comparable to that of an estuary, where water that leaves the estuary at ebb tide may return at flood tide, a process parameterized by the return coefficient. The return coefficient in the GBR due to wind reversals may be as large as 50% at the timescale of the wind. Secondly, in the southern and central regions of the GBR, the southeasterly tradewind deflected the southward flowing oceanic inflow seaward, away from the inner shelf and towards the outer shelf, making room for a wind-driven current of opposite direction on the inner shelf. Thus the intrusion of oceanic water in the GBR depends on the wind over the GBR. The veering of the mean currents around the GBR reef matrix and the wind over the shelf influencing the oceanic circulation demonstrate small scales (the GBR shelf) influencing the large scale oceanic circulation.

2196,"Detailed Bathymetry of the Continental Shelf Beneath the Getz Ice Shelf, West Antarctica","Cochran, JR; Tinto, KJ; Bell, RE","The Getz Ice Shelf (GIS) produces major amounts of basal meltwater due to intrusions of warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) beneath the ice shelf. However, multiple cavity openings and complex geography mean that knowledge of bathymetry beneath the GIS is required to understand ice/ocean interactions. We invert NASA airborne gravity data to obtain bathymetry beneath the ice shelf. Our gravity/geology-constrained bathymetry is a significant advance on Bedmap2 bathymetry. The sub-ice shelf bathymetry consists of three cavities separated by topographic ridges extending from the ice shelf front to the grounding line. Passages allowing limited circulation of shallow (less than or similar to 400 meters below sea level [mbsl]) water between cavities are present, but deeper water is confined to individual cavities. Within each cavity, bathymetric troughs (>900 mbsl) extend from the ice shelf front to subglacial valleys beneath the ice sheet. Our analysis of the gravity data also allows us to infer the presence of thick (>500 m) sediments near the grounding line through much of the GIS, as well as variations in the density and/or thickness of the crust underlying the ice shelf.Plain Language Summary Floating ice shelves surrounding Antarctica slow the flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet toward the ocean. West Antarctic ice shelves, including the large Getz Ice Shelf, have thinned significantly over the past 20 years, due in part to increased flow of warming ocean water into the ocean cavities beneath them. This thinning results in acceleration of ice flowing into the ocean, so that more ice goes afloat, raising sea level. We mapped the shape of the ocean floor beneath the Getz Ice Shelf, which controls water circulation under the ice shelf. We found the ice shelf has three separate portions each with deep troughs that provide pathways for warm water to the edge of the ice sheet.",2020,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,125,10,,WOS:000586451100005,10.1029/2019JF005493,,#20340,Cochran 2020,,
2197,THE VESTERISBANKEN SEAMOUNT (GREENLAND BASIN) - PATTERNS OF MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENT DISTRIBUTION,"HEMPEL, P; SCHREIBER, R; JOHNSON, L; THIEDE, J","A closely spaced grid of seismic reflection profiles has permitted a description of the structure of the Vesterisbanken Seamount (Greenland Sea) and the distribution of the surrounding sediments.  This isolated seamount is situated at 73-degrees-30'N, 9-degrees-10'W in the Greenland Basin and rises from the basin floor at a water depth of about 3100 m to approximately 130 m below sea level; the maximum inclination of its slope is 26-degrees.  It is of basaltic origin, and reveals chaotic reflectors on the seismic profiles.  No inhomogeneities are visible within the volcanic rocks of Vesterisbanken and the basement complex surrounding it.  Dredge samples from the summit of Vesterisbanken reveal an age of approximately 100,000 years.  In the seismic records, there was no sediment cover discernable on top of or on the flanks of the seamount.  At the base of Vesterisbanken, the seismic reflection characteristics suggest an alternation of sediments and basaltic rocks, the latter probably being the result of young lava flows.  In some places the volcanic rocks disturb the sedimentary sequence to such a high degree, that the stratification is virtually eliminated.  Volcanic activity also occurs in the vicinity of the seamount:  for example, about 20 km northwest of Vesterisbanken an intrusion has pierced through 1000 m of sediment, almost reaching the seafloor.  The sediment thickness is variable and it smooths the irregular basement topography.  In addition, the sediment is characterized by local unconformities associated with onlap structures.",1991,,MARINE GEOLOGY,96,1-2,175-185,WOS:A1991FB21100018,10.1016/0025-3227(91)90215-P,,#20344,HEMPEL 1991,,
2199,Volcanism as a prime cause of mass extinctions: Retrospectives and perspectives,"Racki, G","In recent models of earth-system crises, the correlation between the major Phanerozoic mass extinctions and large igneous provinces has been well established. Specifically, pulsed massive exhalations of large amounts of volcanogenic CO2 transformed Earth's atmosphere, leading to an excessive greenhouse effect and global warming, combined with slowed oceanic circulation, oxygen deficiency, and seawater acidification. In a historical context, however, the path leading to this neocatastrophic doctrine, traced by way of ever-more-convincing proofs (in recent years, via mercury anomalies), was convoluted for many objective and notional-personal reasons. From the late eighteenth century to the revolutionary 1980s, the reception of this conceptual route in the English-language mainstream science was determined principally by the rise and fall of the orthodox nonprogressive (steady-state) paradigm of the Lyellian uniformitarian. The main cognitive steps, pioneered frequently in continental Europe, included such principal conclusions as: (1) volcanic eruptions are a natural process, consisting of heat being vented from a central incandescent core, itself a relic of an initial nebular state; (2) cataclysmic phenomena were far more intense in the geologic past, both in orogenic and nonorogenic time intervals, with a dominant nonactualistic style of fissure-type effusive activity in intraplate settings, recorded in vast trap-type basalt successions (= large igneous provinces); (3) volcanogenic gaseous emanations, dominated by carbon dioxide and water vapor, had a strong impact on the global climate in the geological past toward the global warmth mode; and (4) this ""volcanic greenhouse"" was deleteriously augmented by several forms of immanent stress feedback (resulting in anoxia, acidification, hypercapnia, acid rains, ultraviolet radiation, etc.). Overall, diverse global ecosystem interactions, combined with the updated large igneous province scenario, can elucidate all major destructive factors in the biosphere, such as regressive versus transgressive sea-level changes and cooling versus warming climatic responses. Notwithstanding the particularity of each major biodiversity crisis in the Phanerozoic, however, a greenhouse/icehouse volcanism-driven catastrophe is a well-confirmed key toward better understanding these biotic turnovers over a variety of time scales and feedbacks. The holistic volcanic ""press-pulse"" model involves the joint action of two different types of stress factors: long-lived (""press"") large igneous provinces and a variety of critically sudden (""pulse"") disturbances. Therefore, the killing effectiveness of volcanic cataclysm should be viewed not only by the large igneous province size but also by their host geology, magma plumbing system, and eruption dynamics, determining the magnitude and composition of disastrous thermogenic outgassing. In search of possible pulse signals, emphasis has recently been placed on large igneous province-related, volatile-rich, mafic-ultramafic intrusions (owing to the great fluid-bearing capacity of their magmas) and sill-type intrusions (resulting in the most-effective devolatilization of sedimentary rocks). A simultaneous burst of arc magmatism and coeval impact of arc-continent collisions (especially in tropical domain) on global weatherability are additional cumulative cataclysmic stimuli awaiting more rigorous numerical simulations.",2020,,"MASS EXTINCTIONS, VOLCANISM, AND IMPACTS: NEW DEVELOPMENTS",544,,1-34,WOS:000584582200002,10.1130/2020.2544(01)10.1130/SPE544,,#20346,Racki 2020,,

The focus is on the rural poor in the LECZ, as their economic livelihoods are especially endangered both directly by coastal hazards and indirectly through the impacts of climate change on key coastal and near-shore ecosystems. Using geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and infant mortality data for 2000 as a proxy for poverty, this study finds that just 15 developing countries contain over 90% of the world's LECZ rural poor. Low-income countries as a group have the highest incidence of poverty, which declines somewhat for lower middle-income countries, and then is much lower for upper middle-income economies. South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa account for most of the world's LECZ rural poor, and have a high incidence of poverty among their rural LECZ populations. Although fostering growth, especially in coastal areas, may reduce rural poverty in the LECZ, additional policy actions will be required to protect vulnerable communities from disasters, to conserve and restore key coastal and near-shore ecosystems, and to promote key infrastructure investments and coastal community response capability.

2207,Advection of the Salt Wedge and Evolution of the Internal Flow Structure in the Rotterdam Waterway,"de Nijs, MAJ; Pietrzak, JD; Winterwerp, JC","An analysis of field measurements recorded over a tidal cycle in the Rotterdam Waterway is presented. These measurements are the first to elucidate the processes influencing the along-channel current structure and the excursion of the salt wedge in this estuary. The salt wedge structure remained stable throughout the measuring period. The velocity measurements indicate decoupling effects between the layers and that bed-generated turbulence is confined below the pycnocline. The barotropic M(4) overtide structure is imposed at the mouth of the estuary, and the generation of M(4) overtides within the estuary is found to be relatively small. Internal tidal asymmetry does not make a significant contribution to the M(4) velocity frequency band. Instead, the combination of barotropic and baroclinic forcing, in conjunction with the suppression of turbulence at the interface, provides the main explanation for the time dependence and mean structure of the flow in the Rotterdam Waterway. This gives rise to the observed differences in the length of the flood and ebb, in the magnitudes of the flood and ebb velocities, in the length of the slack water periods, and in the timing of the onset of slack water at the surface and near the bed. It results in the formation of distinct exchange flow profiles at the head of the salt wedge around slack water and the creation of maximal velocities at the pycnocline during flood. Advection governs the displacement and structure of the salt wedge since turbulent mixing is suppressed. The tidal displacement of the salt wedge controls the height of the pycnocline above the bed at a particular site. Hence, it controls the height to which bed-generated turbulence can protrude into the water column. Consequently, the authors find asymmetries in the structure of the internal flow, turbulent mixing, and bed stresses that are not related to classical internal tidal asymmetry.",2011,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,41,1,3-27,WOS:000287222200001,10.1175/2010JPO4228.1,,#20358,deNijs 2011,,

Most archaic lakes have vanished, while artificial wetlands have been extending since natural coastal wetlands replaced by salt areas and ponds of shrimps and crabs.

2217,"Characteristics and Driving Mechanisms of Mixing and Stratification in the North Passage of the Changjiang Estuary, China","Wang, YJ; Jiang, CJ; Cheng, HQ; Li, WH; Teng, LZ","Based on the measured hydrological and sediment data of spring and neap tides in the dry and flood seasons of 2016 in the North Passage of the Changjiang Estuary, the gradient Richardson number, Simpson number, and potential energy anomalies were calculated to analyze the tidal cycle, spring-neap variation, and seasonal variation of mixing and stratification. Taking into account the vertical difference of horizontal density gradient, the contribution terms of time derivative of potential energy anomalies was derived, including depth-mean straining, advection, nonmean straining, and tidal stirring. The driving mechanisms of mixing and stratification was investigated by calculating and comparing these four contribution terms. The results show that the seasonal variation of freshwater discharge mainly affected the distance of saltwater intrusion, the saline wedge moved upstream in dry season, while the tidal dynamics had a significant impact on mixing and stratification. In the reaches with saline wedge tip migration, the water column was periodically stratified, and the process was dominated by advection term. In the main reaches of saltwater intrusion, during spring tide the water column was periodically stratified, which was stratified during flood tidal current; it was well mixed during ebb tidal current, and the stratification during flood tidal current was promoted by advection and depth-mean straining. The mixing during ebb tidal current was promoted by tidal stirring and advection; during neap tide, the water column was permanently stratified. The stratification was enhanced during flood tidal current and weakened during ebb tidal current, and the stratification was mainly maintained by depthmean straining.",2022,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,38,1,140-153,WOS:000778382800004,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-21-00053.1,,#20374,Wang 2022,,
2218,Nonlinear model predictive control of salinity and water level in polder networks: Case study of Lissertocht catchment,"Aydin, BE; Essink, GHPO; Delsman, JR; van de Giesen, N; Abraham, E","A significant increase in surface water salinization in low-lying deltas is expected globally due to saline groundwater exfiltration driven by rising sea levels and decreasing freshwater availability. Sustaining fresh water-dependent agriculture in such areas will entail an increased demand for fresh water flushing. Unfortu-nately, the flushing of surface water is not operationally optimised and results in excessive use of scarce fresh-water. To meet the increased demand for flushing, while minimizing the need for diverted freshwater, new operational designs are required. This paper presents a novel network model based approach that uses De Saint Venant (SV) and Advection Dispersion (AD) equations to optimize multiple objectives on water level and salinity control using a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The resulting NMPC problem is solved with a receding horizon implementation, where the nonlinear program (NLP) at each iteration is solved using state-of -the-art large scale interior point solver (IPOPT). We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the traditional fixed flushing for a representative Dutch polder. Firstly, the approach is shown to be capable of controlling the water level and salinity level in the polder. Secondly, the results highlight that the network of canals, which were originally made for drainage, could not be made sufficiently fresh with current intake capacity. A simple design approach was used to identify appropriate new capacities for two of the gates that allow optimal flushing to guarantee the required water level and salinity constraints.",2022,,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,264,,,WOS:000793045300007,10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107502,,#20375,Aydin 2022,,
2219,Digital assessment of soil-salinity dynamics after a major flood in the Niger River valley,"Michot, D; Walter, C; Adam, I; Guero, Y","Salinisation threatens the sustainability of irrigated paddy fields in western Africa. To reclaim saline soils and improve the management of irrigated paddy fields, it is necessary to evaluate and monitor soil salinity in space and time. Proximal soil sensing by apparent electrical resistivity (ER) measurements can help to survey soil salinity. This study aimed to assess changes in the spatial pattern of salinity in vertisols using high resolution 3D mapping at 2 dates on an 8-ha experimental site located at Kollo, Niger, along the Niger River. For each measurement campaign, the survey combined ER and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements of a 1:5 soil:water extract. This procedure was performed in May 2008 and again in March 2011 after a 100-year flood of the study area by the Niger River. EC measurements were performed on soil samples collected at 3 depths at 140 points. ER measurements were performed at 420 points at 2 and 4 depths for the first and second campaigns, respectively. We built an inference model of EC using a regression-tree method for 3 prediction depths. The predictive data were the two ER measurements, their ratio and a qualitative description of land use. The maps generated by ordinary kriging of predicted EC revealed strong lateral salinity gradients ranging from 03 to 5.0 dS/m (RMSE = 0.79-0.83 dS/m). Vertical variability in salinity was also significant and its pattern could be explained by land use, mainly irrigation intensity. In 2011, salt stocks in the upper 60 cm of the soil ranged from low stocks (<2 kg/m(2)) to extremely high stocks along the levee border (5.5-8.0 kg/m(2)). Comparisons of the 2008 and 2011 salinity maps at 3 depths indicated stable spatial patterns and highlighted the high resilience of the system. Consequently, desalinisation efforts can only minimise soil salinity in the upper cultivated horizon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2221,"GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE FOR EARTHQUAKES DURING THE PAST 2000 YEARS ALONG THE COPALIS RIVER, SOUTHERN COASTAL WASHINGTON","ATWATER, BF","Evidence for several prehistoric earthquakes is present in deposits less than 2000 years old that crop out at the Copalis River estuary (47-degrees-07.2'N, 124-degrees-09.7'W). The deposits show that land subsided decimeters into the intertidal zone on as many as three occasions and that sand vented while the land underwent little or no subsidence on another occasion. The evidence for earthquake-induced subsidence consists of buried marsh and forest soils that evince sudden estuarine submergence attended on at least one occasion by a landward directed surge of sandy water. This combination of submergence and surge implies subsidence and tsunami. Exposed evidence for subsidence and tsunami along the Copalis River is strong for a time within a few decades of 300 years ago, moderate for a time 1400-1900 years ago, and weak (subsidence) or lacking (tsunami) for an intermediate time also about 1400-1900 years ago. The history of sudden submergence and tsunami in the past 2000 years at the Copalis River estuary resembles that shown by buried soils farther south in coastal Washington at Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay. The history can be explained most simply by great (Mw of 8 or 9) thrust earthquakes at the boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North America plates, with one or two earthquakes occurring 1400-1900 years ago and another close to 300 years ago. The evidence for earthquake-induced venting along the Copalis River consists of sand intrusions and vented-sand volcanoes. The sand rose through muddy estuarine deposits at least 3 m thick, entraining these deposits in fragments as much as 0.3 m long. Intrusion occurred at one or more times in the past 2000 years, and at least some of the venting occurred 900-1300 years ago. The sand bodies do not imply artesian flow of flood-pressured groundwater because the sand vented forcefully and infrequently through a lowland that probably lacked natural levees. The earthquake implied by the venting of sand 900-1300 years ago could have come from a source below, above, or at the boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North America plates. If from the subducted Juan de Fuca plate the implied earthquake was farther west or larger than the largest earthquakes within that plate during the past 100 years. Evidence permitting a source within the North America plate includes a fault scarp, an uplifted tideflat, and landslides near Puget Sound dating from the interval 700-1700 years ago. A plate boundary source would explain buried soils whose estuarine submergence and burial imply coseismic subsidence for parts of coastal Washington in the interval 600-1300 years ago. However, stratigraphy shows that little or no coseismic subsidence occurred along the Copalis River during the venting 900-1300 years ago. If a plate boundary earthquake struck coastal Washington 900-1300 years ago, the earthquake produced a different distribution of land level change than did the plate boundary earthquakes inferred for 1400-1900 and 300 years ago.",1992,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,97,B2,1901-1919,WOS:A1992HD47700018,10.1029/91JB02346,,#20378,ATWATER 1992,,

Climate change may result in sea level rise; water temperature increase; and deviations from present patterns of precipitation, wind, and water circulation.  Estuaries may experience loss of marsh habitat, intrusion of marine waters and associated organisms, changes in circulation patterns that affect retention of some indigenous species, and increased hypoxia and storm surges.  Estuarine and coastal systems could experience poleward retreat of cold-tolerant species and range expansion of warm-tolerant species.  Some fisheries and aquacultural enterprises and communities would benefit from the results of climate change and other would suffer losses, with economic and population dislocations probably inevitable in many parts of the world.  Thus, flexibility in policy-making and planning will be vital if global climate is modified as rapidly as is anticipated by some scientists.",1990,,FISHERIES,15,6,16-24,WOS:A1990EP10600005,10.1577/1548-8446(1990)015<0016:AEOCCO>2.0.CO;2,,#20380,KENNEDY 1990,,

In this study, we propose a general and analytical salt intrusion model inspired by Guo's general unit hydrograph theory for flood hydrograph prediction in a watershed. To derive a simple, general and analytical model of salinity distribution, we first make four hypotheses on the longitudinal salinity gradient based on empirical observations; we then derive a general unit hydrograph for the salinity distribution along a partially mixed or well-mixed estuary. The newly developed model can be well calibrated using a minimum of three salinity measurements along the estuary axis and does converge towards zero when the along-estuary distance approaches infinity asymptotically. The theory has been successfully applied to reproduce the salt intrusion in 21 estuaries worldwide, which suggests that the proposed method can be a useful tool for quickly assessing the spread of salinity under a wide range of riverine and tidal conditions and for quantifying the potential impacts of human-induced and natural changes.",2023,,OCEAN SCIENCE,19,3,603-614,WOS:000986597500001,10.5194/os-19-603-2023,,#20381,Cai 2023,,

This paper highlights examples of coexistence of nature and engineering structure in flood control systems in US and Kong Kong, and treats the idea on a new project, a bypass flooding system in Kuching, Malaysia by computer simulation. When the Kuching floodway idles during normal days, it is modelled as a pond to match the surrounding peat swamp. The in-channel pond requires lower flow, allowing the downstream river its natural flows. The modelling simulation shows plausible results to put back nature in man-made system to restrain saline intrusion and problem of low flushing due to flow diversion.

2229,Hydrography and frontogenesis in a glacial fjord off the Strait of Magellan,"Valle-Levinson, A; Blanco, JL; Frangopulos, M","Current velocity and hydrographic profiles obtained for the first time in a Chilean glacial fjord were combined with under-way surface temperature and salinity measurements to describe the formation of tidal intrusion fronts and plume-like fronts. These fronts formed within several hundred meters from each other in the vicinity of a shallow sill, maximum depth of approximately 3 m, in a glacial fjord off the Strait of Magellan in the Chilean Patagonia. Measurements were obtained in mid-December of 2003 and 2004, during late austral spring, under active glacier melting and calving. The glacial fjord is approximately 18 km long from the face of the glacier to the connection with the Strait of Magellan and typically less than 1 km wide throughout the system. Between the glacier face and the 3-m sill, depths are typically less than 100 m, and seaward of the sill, depths increase to more than 200 m. Velocity and salinity data obtained during flood periods revealed that water with oceanic salinity was aspirated to near-surface levels from depths of approximately 30 m as flood flows accelerated from approximately 10 cm s(-1), seaward of the sill, to approximately 60 cm s(-1) at the sill crest. The upwelled water was then slightly diluted by mixing at the sill crest before plunging down to the basin between the glacier and the sill. The plunging of salty water over the sill created dramatic tidal intrusion fronts only a few tens of meters from the sill crest and pumping of salt with every flood period. During ebb periods, the low salinity waters derived from the glacier and a small river near the glacier converged at the sill crest. After some mixing, the buoyant waters were released within a thin layer (similar to 3 m deep) lead by a plume-like front that remained coherent for a few hundred meters seaward of the sill. The main findings of this study were that tidal intrusion and plume fronts were observed within 2 km from each other, and that tidal pumping was the predominant mechanism for salt fluxes into the system.",2006,,OCEAN DYNAMICS,56,3-4,217-227,WOS:000238533200003,10.1007/s10236-005-0048-8,,#20391,Valle-Levinson 2006,,
2230,A Multidisciplinary Approach for Clarifying the Recharge Processes and Origin of Saline Water in the Semi-Arid Punata Alluvial fan in Bolivia,"Amaya, AG; Barmen, G; Munoz, G","The analysis of stable isotopes assisted in identifying that groundwater in the Punata alluvial fan is mainly recharged by heavy flash floods, and the recharge from rainfall is of less importance. In addition, the hydrochemical analysis identified the Pucara River as the main source of recharge. Other streams in the north and northwest of the fan do not seem to contribute to the recharge. The hydrochemistry also shows that there is an increase of the Na+ and Cl- concentrations in the middle and distal part of the fan. The salinization of groundwater is most likely a result of the mixing of fresh water with residual saline pore water in the lacustrine deposits and/or ion exchange within these layers. Geophysical surveys assisted in describing the aquifer system layering, and indicated a fine-grained bottom layer where ion exchange might occur. This study demonstrates that the integration of several methods (e.g., hydrochemistry, hydrogeophysics, and stable isotopes) is valuable for clarifying ambiguities during the interpretation process and for characterizing hydrogeological processes in alluvial fans in general.",2018,,WATER,10,7,,WOS:000442579700129,10.3390/w10070946,,#20392,Amaya 2018,,
2231,"Architecture and evolution of a fjord-head delta, western Vancouver island, British Columbia","Gutsell, JE; Clague, JJ; Best, ME; Bobrowsky, PT; Hutchinson, I","The architectural framework and Holocene evolution of the Zeballos fjord-head delta on west-central Vancouver Island was established through a multidisciplinary field-based Study. The Zeballos delta is a composite feature, consisting of an elevated, incised, late Pleistocene delta and an inset Holocene delta graded to present sea level. Both deltas have a classic Gilbert-type tripartite architecture, with nearly flat topset and bottomset units and an inclined foreset unit. Time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys, borehole data, and gravel pit exposures provided information on the internal form, lithologies and substrate of both deltas. Both sets of deltaic deposits coarsen upward from silt in the bottomset unit to gravel in the topset unit. The TDEM survey revealed a highly irregular, buried bedrock surface, ranging from 20 m to 190 m in depth, and it delineated saltwater intrusion into the deltaic sediments.Late Quaternary sea-level change at Zeballos was inferred from delta morphology and the GPR survey. The elevated, late Pleistocene delta was constructed when the sea was about 21 m higher relative to the land than it is today. It was dissected when sea-level fell rapidly as a result of glacio-isostatic rebound. Relative sea-level reached a position about 20 m below the present datum during the early Holocene. Foreset beds that overlap and progressively climb in a seaward direction and topset beds that thicken to 26 m landward imply that the delta aggraded and prograded into Zeballos Inlet during the middle and late Holocene transgression. Sea-level may have risen above the present datum during the middle Holocene, creating a delta plain at about 4 m a.s.l. Remnants of this surface are preserved along the valley margins.

2232,Impact of Hydrostratigraphic Continuity on Brine-to-Freshwater Interface Dynamics: Implications From a Two-Dimensional Parametric Study in an Arid and Endorheic Basin,"McKnight, SV; Boutt, DF; Munk, LA","Despite the prevalence of density-dependent flow systems in the brine-rich aquifers of arid climates and coastal aquifers, the impact of realistic geologic conditions on interface geometry and density-dependent time-sensitive dynamics remains poorly constrained. Salar de Atacama provides an analog for exploring interface dynamics in arid regions. A site-specific two-dimensional hydrostratigraphic interpretation is used to examine the dynamics of the brine-to-freshwater interface. With the same simulation framework and core data, a separate parametric series of hydraulic conductivity distributions with varying horizontal continuity provides a mechanistic explanation for observed dynamics. Comparing modeled interfaces and their sensitivity to perturbations in recharge in each realization yields insight into interface dynamics coupled with horizontal continuity in subsurface heterogeneity. Recharge fluctuation is introduced to each distribution following the interface reaching a dynamic steady state. Metrics for results evaluation include interface slope geometry, interface width, migration length, and response rate. Analyses suggest that the average slope of the modeled interface shallows by 0.01 and 0.05 m . m(-1) for an increase in continuity of highly permeable pathways by a factor of two and three, respectively. Increasing continuity also increases the overall response times and the variability in response. Results indicate that accurate representations of transient dynamics in modeling density-dependent brine-to-freshwater interface dynamics requires the consideration of heterogeneity, as saline intrusion in the highest continuity group extends over twice as far on average and the modeled interface takes over 43% more time on average to reach a new dynamic steady state when compared to their homogeneous counterparts.Plain Language Summary Differences in the density of groundwater from dissolved salt causes groundwater flow to behave differently under different subsurface conditions. This paper focuses on how spatial differences in porosity affects flow behavior and changes the risk of saline groundwater intrusion. Core and groundwater data from the southeastern edge of the salt flat in Salar de Atacama provides information on subsurface physical characteristics and groundwater chemistry. This data is used to create an interpretation of how flow properties vary in time and space. This provides a means for assessing the impact of spatially variable geology on the geometry and the sensitivity of the brine-tofreshwater interface to changes in recharge to an aquifer. We use distributions of the area's geology to test different amounts of geologic variability in the horizontal versus the vertical direction. Results indicate that more horizontal continuity shallows the geometry and increases the time required for a brine-tofreshwater interface to reach a new position following a change in recharge. These model results suggest that it is important to consider how differences in the flow properties of different geologic units impact the response time and the extent of saline intrusion in deserts as well as any other areas that might have salty groundwater.",2021,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,57,4,,WOS:000644063800018,10.1029/2020WR028302,,#20399,McKnight 2021,,

In this study, we established artificial environmental gradients in a series of pot experiments with controlled environments to investigate the effects of salinity, sediment type and waterlogging on the performance of and interactions between Phragmites australis (native) and Spartina alterniflora (alien), which generally co-exist in the saline intertidal zones of Chinese and American coasts. Significant effects of salinity and waterlogging were detected on biomass production and morphological characteristics of S. alterniflora and P. australis, and the competitive interactions between the two species were found to vary with all three environmental factors in our experiments. Relative Neighbor Effect (RNE) analyses indicate that competitive dominance of S. alterniflora occurred under the conditions of high salinity, sandy sediment and full immersion, whereas P. australis showed competitive dominance under the conditions of low salinity and non-immersion. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora might outcompete P. australis under conditions present in early salt marsh succession, which support the viewpoint that the outcomes of competition between co-occurring native and invasive alien plants depend on the growing conditions. The implication of this study is that in response to the environmental changes expected from seawater intrusion and sea-level rise, the range of S. alterniflora is expected to expand further in the Yangtze River estuary in the future.",2006,,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,8,7,1547-1560,WOS:000241605600012,10.1007/s10530-005-5846-x,,#20404,Wang 2006,,
2235,Reducing groundwater vulnerability in Carbonate Island countries in the Pacific,"White, I; Falkland, T","Many small island countries in the Pacific rely on shallow, fresh groundwater lenses in highly permeable coral sand and karst limestone aquifers, underlain and surrounded by sea-water, as their main freshwater source. The delicate balance in small islands, between groundwater recharge and discharge into and mixing with seawater, as well as extraction of groundwater by communities, is threatened regularly by climate variability, storm surges, over-pumping, as well as by pollution from land uses and waste disposal. In low islands, predicted sea-level rises resulting from climate change are a further major threat. Together, the hydrogeology of fresh groundwater lenses and these natural climatic and anthropogenic threats make small coral island groundwater some of the most vulnerable systems in the world. This linkage between natural and human pressures means that small coral island groundwater systems are exemplars of the GRAPHIC approach to sustainable groundwater management. In this chapter, a simple steady-state approximation is used to provide insight into the key climatic, hydrogeological, physiographic, and management factors that influence the quantity of, and saline intrusion into freshwater lenses. Examples of the dynamic nature of freshwater lenses as they respond to these drivers are given. Natural and human-related threats to freshwater lenses are discussed. Strategies and policies processes to ensure groundwater sustainability and reduce its vulnerability in small islands are presented and suggested improvements to donor and aid programs in water are also advanced. It is argued that because of the extreme vulnerability of small island groundwater systems, management strategies and policy must be based on the very best technical information and using regional networks as exemplified by GRAPHIC.",2011,,CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES: A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,27,,75-110,WOS:000361607800006,,,#20407,White 2011,,

2240,The Impact of Tidal Straining and Advection on the Stratification in a Partially Mixed Estuary,"Zhang, J; Cheng, L; Wang, YJ; Jiang, CJ","Stratification and mixing of the water column is an important dynamic process in the estuary, which plays a significant role in the estuarine circulation, mass transport and energy exchange. Based on the multi-station synchronous observation data from 26 February to 6 March in 2011 during dry season in the North Channel of the Changjiang Estuary, the Richardson number, the Simpson number and the potential energy anomaly of water were calculated to analyze the tidal variation of the mixing and stratification processes. The roles of the depth-mean straining, longitudinal advection, non-mean straining and tidal stirring in the processes of mixing and stratification of the water column were analyzed by calculating the contribution terms of the time-derivative of potential energy anomaly. The results show that the mixing and stratification of the water column in the North Channel have significant spatiotemporal variation. Stability of the stratification gradually decreases from neap tide to spring tide. In the reaches of salt wedge migration, permanent stratification develops during neap and mean tide, with stability increasing on the flood and decreasing on the ebb, which is dominated by longitudinal advection. During spring tide, periodic stratification develops, with development of stratification on the flood and its breakdown on the ebb, which is dominated by longitudinal advection and tidal stirring. In the main reaches of saltwater intrusion, permanent stratification develops during neap tide, with stability increasing on the ebb and decreasing on the flood, which is dominated by depth-mean tidal straining. During mean and spring tide, periodic stratification occurs, with development of stratification on the ebb and its breakdown on the flood, which is controlled by depth-mean tidal straining and assisted by tidal stirring. In the North Channel, tidal advection is the main stratifying agent in the salt wedge migration reaches, and tidal straining is the main stratifying agent in the main reaches of saltwater intrusion.",2023,,WATER,15,2,,WOS:000918986900001,10.3390/w15020339,,#20415,Zhang 2023,,
2242,Simulation of wind-driven rain associated with tropical storms and hurricanes using the 12-fan Wall of Wind,"Baheru, T; Chowdhury, AG; Bitsuamlak, G; Masters, FJ; Tokay, A","Wind-driven rain (WDR) is among the important environmental variables that affect the performance and durability of building enclosure systems. Although the need to investigate multi-level effects of WDR on building structures has increased through time, the available methods of investigation have been generally limited to field study and application of computational fluid dynamics. This paper investigates the parameters of tropical storm and hurricane-level WDR and presents a methodology of experimental simulation of WDR that may complement the two other investigation methods. Tropical cyclone WDR data acquired through National Aeronautics and Space Administrations' Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ground validation program were used to study the characteristics of tropical storm and hurricane-level WDR and derive the values of target parameters, which were later used in the experimental simulation process. Procedure for determination of target WDR rate, simulation of raindrop size distribution and its integral parameters, and selection of type and number of nozzles are discussed in detail. Similarity requirements and important scaling considerations of WDR simulation were addressed. The procedure was used to simulate WDR using the 12-fan Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University. The experimental simulation results demonstrated satisfactory representation of target rainfall intensity and raindrop size distribution in the test setup. The WDR simulation methodology presented herein may be used for simulation of WDR in testing facilities to evaluate water intrusion in buildings during tropical cyclones, develop solutions to promote functional longevity of building envelope, and enhance current simplified test protocols given in international standards.

The majority of the total viral abundance was bacteriophage and only 5.4% of the total was algal virus. Total viral abundance varied with season and location, ranging from 6.75x10(-5)-1.68x10(7) particles/ml, and the virus:bacterium ratio (VBR) ranged from 1.52 to 72.02 with a mean of 8.7. In the present study, viral abundance peaked in both the summer and the winter, unlike the typical seasonal pattern reported in the literature, in which viral abundance peaks in the summer when bacterial hosts are also at their most abundant. However, the driving forces for the two peaks reported here were totally different, the summer viral abundance peak coupled With the development of bacterial hosts which were controlled largely by temperature year-round and by trophic state occasionally while the winter one seemed to be multi-factor controlled. The host-phage interaction was no longer predominant in control of the winter viral abundance as bacterial abundance was lowest in this season. The winter low temperature would help maintain a high vital abundance as high temperatures might increase viral inactivation and viral decay; the VBR peak values actually Occurred In the winter. More importantly, the high virus-containing freshwater discharge in winter due to a higher proportion Of anthropogenic sewage relative to low natural flooding in Winter run-off, turned Out to be the first Factor contributing to the high winter Viral abundance and VBR values. Ill addition, the variation of intrusion of warm and relatively oligotrophic water from oceanic Currents played a role alternating the distribution patterns of temperature, salinity and trophic conditions and consequently the distribution patterns of virus and bacteria seasonally and spatially.

This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere.

Microbial plankton communities are important to pelagic food webs including in the GoM but understanding the drivers of the natural dynamics of these passively distributed microorganisms can be challenging in such a large and heterogeneous system. As part of the DEEPEND consortium, we applied high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of pelagic microbial plankton related to several environmental conditions during two offshore cruises in 2015. Our results show dramatic community shifts across depths, especially between photic and aphotic zones. Though we only have two time points within a single year, observed temporal shifts in microbial plankton communities were restricted to the seasonally influenced epipelagic zone (0-200 m), and appear mainly driven by changes in temperature. Environmental selection in microbial plankton communities was depth-specific, with variables such as turbidity, salinity, and abundance of photosynthetic taxa strongly correlating with community structure in the epipelagic zone, while variables such as oxygen and specific nutrient concentrations were correlated with community structure at deeper depths.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,9,,,WOS:000454888000001,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03175,,#20436,Easson 2019,,
2251,Impacts of Tide Gate Modulation on Ammonia Transport in a Semi-closed Estuary during the Dry Season-A Case Study at the Lianjiang River in South China,"Zhao, CJ; Yang, HJ; Fan, ZY; Zhu, L; Wang, WC; Zeng, FT","Recovery of tide-receiving is considered to improve the water quality in the Lianjiang River, a severely polluted and tide-influenced river connected to the South China Sea. A tide-receiving scenario, i.e., keeping the tide gate open, is compared with the other scenario representing the non-tide-receiving condition, i.e., blocking the tide flow during the flood phase, by numerical simulations based on the EFDC (Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code) model. The impacts of tide receiving were evaluated by the variation in the concentration of ammonia and its exporting fluxes, mainly in the downstream part of the river. With more water mass coming into the river, in the tide-receiving scenario, the averaged concentration of ammonia reduced by 20-40%, with the most significant decrease of 0.64 g m(-3). However, the exporting flux of ammonia has decreased in the tide-receiving scenario, as the consequence of the back-forth oscillation of tidal current. In the tide-receiving scenario, the time series of ammonia concentration approximately followed the tidal oscillation, with increased concentration during the ebb tide and reduction in the flood tide. In the non-tide-receiving scenario, the ammonia concentration decreases when the tide gate is open which results in further intrusion of seawater. This was followed by an increase in ammonia concentration again after the currents shift seaward and water mass with higher concentration from the upstream part is transported downstream. Given the identical ammonia input and river runoff, the ammonia concentration stays lower in the tide-receiving scenario, except for short periods after the tide gate opening and neap tides in the downstream part which lasts for around half a day. This study highlights the importance of hydrodynamic condition, specifically tidal oscillation, in the semi-diurnal and fortnight cycles, for the transportation of waterborne materials. Furthermore, the operation of the tide gate was additionally discussed based on potential varied practical conditions and evaluation criteria.",2020,,WATER,12,7,,WOS:000556496500001,10.3390/w12071945,,#20437,Zhao 2020,,
2252,"Coastal sand mining of heavy mineral sands: Contestations, resistance, and ecological distribution conflicts at HMS extraction frontiers across the world","Bisht, A; Martinez-Alier, J","Coastal sand mining for metals involves extraction of heavy mineral sands (HMS), which are sedimentary deposits of dense minerals that accumulate in coastal environments. HMS are localized concentrations of ores such as ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, and iron, which are sources of metals such as titanium, zircon, iron, sillimanite/kyanite, staurolite, monazite, and garnet. The applications of these metals range from everyday products such as ceramics, paint, and pigments, as well as technologically advanced applications in the airline, shipbuilding, medicine, and defense industries. HMS extraction implies strip mining of coastal areas, which are often unique biodiversity ecosystems, or fragile ecosystems built up on sandy soils or dunes. The loss of such spaces has impacts such as loss of biodiversity and habitats, salt-water intrusion into agricultural lands and increased exposure to sea level rise. As a result of the serious ecological and socioeconomic transformations at such extraction frontiers, these operations cause resistance movements across the world. This article identifies and documents 24 cases of resistance against such operations. It presents the first comprehensive database and analysis of HMS related ecological distribution conflicts.",2023,,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY,27,1,238-253,WOS:000904760800001,10.1111/jiec.13358,,#20439,Bisht 2023,,
2257,Recent changes in hydrodynamic characteristics of the Pearl River Delta during the flood period and associated underlying causes,"Li, CJ; Yu, MH; Cai, HY; Chen, XQ","It is well-known that both human activities and river-tide dynamics are significant factors affecting the hydrodynamic process in estuarine and coastal regions. In this respect, it is considered that riverbed down-cutting exacerbated by human interventions (such as dam construction, sand excavation, and dredging for navigation) may exert dramatic changes in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Pearl River Delta (PRD). In this study, changes in the rating curves of residual water level (RWL) versus residual water discharge (RWD) at upstream stations of the PRD are examined between three extreme floods (here termed as ""986,"" ""056,"" and ""086,"" respectively), in addition to variations in RWL along the West, North, and East Rivers. The results show a dramatic downshift of the rating curves (0.65-4.9 m) in ""056"" and ""086"", compared with the case in ""986"". Besides, the RWL along the three tributaries fell significantly at the same RWD and the maximum reduction in the RWL occurred in the East River. It is considered that the main reason for this occurrence could be contributed to uneven deepening of river channels induced by uncontrolled and disorderly human activities. In addition, the decrease in RWL was more significant in the upper reaches than that in the lower reaches, which reduced the RWL slope and enhanced the PRD tidal dynamics. However, compared with the case in ""056,"" the rating curves in ""086"" are seen to shift up slightly (0.11-0.29 m) and the RWL increased in upstream parts but decreased in downstream parts in the West and North Rivers. This phenomenon can be attributed to the impacts of river-tide dynamics: river flow plays an important role upstream, and the flood wave in ""086"" delivered more water volume into the PRD for the same range of RWD and raised the RWL, whereas tidal dynamics contributed considerably to the effects downstream and the small tidal range in ""086"" lowered the RWL. It is anticipated that these results can be used as scientific guidelines for general water management and particularly for flood control in the PRD.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,179,,,WOS:000486105500017,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104814,,#20448,Li 2019,,
2261,Palaeoweathering characteristics of an intrabasaltic red bole of the Deccan Flood Basalts near Shrivardhan of western coast of India,"Sayyed, MRG; Pardeshi, RG; Islam, R","An intrabasaltic red bole horizon is studied for its weathering characteristics with respect to the underlying and overlying basalts. The study indicates that all the three units have been considerably weathered; the red bole unit, however shows some distinctive characteristics. The red boles show a higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) and lower sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and organic carbon (OC) as compared to the weathered basalts. The lower values of Al2O3, TiO2 and Fe2O3(T) in red boles indicate their lesser weathering than the underlying and overlying basalts, which is further corroborated by the weathering intensity measured by the indices like chemical index of alteration (CIA) and statistical empirical index of chemical weathering (W). It is also evident that the red bole samples show more retention of original mafic and felsic components. While K2O exhibits an erratic behaviour, the MgO and CaO do not show much leaching in red boles. Lesser leaching and salinity in the red boles is indicated by the higher values of calcification and lower values of salinization. The SiO2-Al2O3-Fe2O3 plot indicates that red bole samples are close to the basalt field, while the weathered upper basalt is more kaolinized than the weathered lower basalt. These observations reveal that the post-formational weathering processes have least affected the original palaeoweathering characters of the red bole horizon and hence the intrabasaltic palaeosols (weathering horizons) can effectively be used to constrain the palaeoweathering and palaeoclimates during the continental flood basalt episodes in the geologic past.",2014,,JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,123,7,1717-1728,WOS:000343954200019,10.1007/s12040-014-0481-5,,#20457,Sayyed 2014,,

2266,"Effect of a broad shallow sill on tidal circulation and salt transport in the entrance to a coastal plain estuary (Mira-Vila Nova de Milfontes, Portugal)","Blanton, JO; Andrade, FA; Ferreira, MA","We describe the tidal circulation and salinity regime of a coastal plain estuary that connects to the ocean through a flood tide delta. The delta acts as a sill, and we examine the mechanisms through which the sill affects exchange of estuarine water with the ocean. Given enough buoyancy, the dynamics of tidal intrusion fronts across the sill and selective withdrawal (aspiration) in the deeper channel landward appear to control the exchange of seawater with estuarine water. Comparison of currents on the sill and stratification in the channel reveals aspiration depths smaller than channel depth during neap tide. During neap tide and strong vertical stratification, seawater plunges beneath the less dense estuarine water somewhere on the sill. Turbulence in the intruding bottom layer on the sill promotes entrainment of fluid from the surface layer, and the seawater along the sill bottom is diluted with estuarine water. During ebb flow, salt is effectively trapped landward of the sill in a stagnant zone between the aspiration depth and the bottom where it can be advected farther upstream by flood currents. During spring tide, the plunge point moves landward and off the sill, stratification is weakened in the deep channel, and aspiration during ebb extends to the bottom. This prevents the formation of stagnant water near the bottom, and the estuary is flooded with high salinity water far inland. The neap-spring cycle of tidal intrusion fronts on flood coupled with aspiration during ebb interacts with the sill to play an important role in the transport and retention of salt within the estuary.",2000,,ESTUARIES,23,3,293-304,WOS:000088106100001,10.2307/1353322,,#20464,Blanton 2000,,
2271,Eddy and tidal driven basal melting of the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves,"Xia, YW; Gwyther, DE; Galton-Fenzi, B; Cougnon, EA; Fraser, AD; Moore, JC","The mass loss from the neighboring Totten and Moscow University ice shelves is accelerating and may raise global sea levels in coming centuries. Totten Glacier is mostly based on bedrock below sea level, and so is vulnerable to warm water intrusion reducing its ice shelf buttressing. The mechanisms driving the ocean forced sub-ice-shelf melting remains to be further explored. In this study, we simulate oceanic-driven ice shelf melting of the Totten (TIS) and Moscow University ice shelves (MUIS) using a high spatiotemporal resolution model that resolves both eddy and tidal processes. We selected the year 2014 as representative of the period 1992 to 2017 to investigate how basal melting varies on spatial and temporal scales. We apply the wavelet coherence method to investigate the interactions between the two ice shelves in time-frequency space and hence estimate the contributions from tidal (<1.5 days) and eddy (2-35 days) components of the ocean heat transport to the basal melting of each ice shelf. In our simulation, the 2014 mean basal melt rate for TIS is 6.7 m yr(-1) (42 Gt yr(-1)) and 9.7 m yr(-1) (52 Gt yr(-1)) for MUIS. We find high wavelet coherence in the eddy dominated frequency band between the two ice shelves over almost the whole year. The wavelet coherence along five transects across the ice shelves suggests that TIS basal melting is dominated by eddy processes, while MUIS basal melting is dominated by tidal processes. The eddy-dominated basal melt for TIS is probably due to the large and convoluted bathymetric gradients beneath the ice shelf, weakening higher frequency tidal mode transport. This illustrates the key role of accurate bathymetric data plays in simulating on-going and future evolution of these important ice shelves.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000972827800001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1159353,,#20471,Xia 2023,,
2275,"Geochemical fingerprints of glacially eroded bedrock from West Antarctica: Detrital thermochronology, radiogenic isotope systematics and trace element geochemistry in Late Holocene glacial-marine sediments","Pereira, PS; van de Flierdt, T; Hemming, SR; Hammond, SJ; Kuhn, G; Brachfeld, S; Doherty, C; Hillenbrand, CD","Geochemical provenance studies of glacial-marine sediments provide a powerful approach to describe subglacial geology, sediment transport pathways, and past ice sheet dynamics. The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is considered highly vulnerable to ocean warming and sea level rise that is likely to cause its rapid and irreversible retreat. Studies of its past response to climate change are hence essential for projecting its future behaviour. The application of radiogenic and trace element provenance studies for past ice sheet reconstructions requires surveying the geographic variability of geochemical compositions of glaciomarine sediments. In this study, we characterize the provenance of the detrital fraction of 67 Late Holocene marine sediment samples collected off the Pacific margin of West Antarctica (60 degrees W to 160 degrees W), including 40Ar/39Ar ages of individual hornblende and biotite grains (> 150 mu m), as well as Sr and Nd isotope and trace element composition of the fine-grained (< 63 mu m) sediment fraction. Overall, this approach allows differentiating West Antarctica into five source regions: the Antarctic Peninsula, Bellingshausen Sea, Amundsen Sea, Wrigley Gulf-Hobbs Coast and Sulzberger Bay. Minor geochemical variability is found within each individual sector due to local variability in onland geology. 40Ar/39Ar ages of iceberg-rafted hornblende and biotite grains record primarily Carboniferous to Lates Quaternary ages (similar to 0 to 380 Ma), with a notable age peak of similar to 100 Ma, associated with plutonic intrusions or deformation events during the mid-Cretaceous. Permian-Jurassic 40Ar/39Ar ages are widespread in the Amundsen Sea sector, marking episodes of large-volume magmatism along the long-lived continental margin. Metasedimentary rocks and Late Cenozoic alkali basalts in West Antarctica cannot be detected using detrital hornblende and biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages due to the absence or small grain-size (i.e. < 150 pm) of these minerals in such rocks. These sources can however be readily recognized by their fine-grained geochemical composition. In addition, geographic trends in the provenance from proximal to distal sites provide insights into major sediment transport pathways. While the transport of fine-grained detritus follows bathymetric cross-shelf troughs, the distribution of iceberg-rafted grains shows influence by transport in the Antarctic Coastal Current. Our study provides the first systematic geochemical characterisation of sediment provenance off West Antarctica, and highlights the importance of combining multiple provenance approaches in different size fractions of glacial marine sediments, and paves the way to investigate past WAIS dynamics.",2018,,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,182,,204-232,WOS:000436222700011,10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.04.011,,#20478,Pereira 2018,,
2276,Past and Future Ecosystem Change in the Coastal Zone,"Gell, P","The coastal zone is in a constant state of flux. Long term records of change attest to high amplitude sea level changes. Relative stability though the Late Holocene has allowed for the evolution of barrier dune systems, estuaries and coastal lakes with associated plant and faunal associations. This evolution has been interspersed with changes in the balance between climate driven changes in outflow from catchments. These interactions have been considerably disturbed through the impacts of industrialised people who have diverted and consumed water and invested in infrastructure that has impacted on river flows and the tidal prism in estuaries. This has impacted their provisioning services to humans. It has also impacted their regulating services in that development along the coastline has impacted on the resilience of the littoral zone to absorb natural climate extremes. Looking from the past we can see the pathway to the future and more easily recognise the steps needed to avoid further coastal degradation. This will increasingly need to accommodate the impacts of future climate trends, increased climate extremes and rising seas. Coastal societies would do well to identify their long term pathway to adaptation to the challenges that lie ahead and plan to invest accordingly.",2017,,2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TROPICAL AND COASTAL REGION ECO DEVELOPMENT 2016,55,,,WOS:000400161100001,10.1088/1755-1315/55/1/012001,,#20479,Gell 2017,,
2279,A simplified equation of approximate interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers,"Rathore, SS; Tang, YN; Lu, CH; Luo, J","In this study, we provide a simplified equation with a new concise set of parameters defining the approximate interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers. We derive the solution directly by applying the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation at the outset, and mathematically prove its sameness for the uniform flow in a vertical plane with the interface profile computed using the comprehensive discharge potential theory by Strack and Ausk (2015). We present a surprising result that interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary turns out to be same as in which water table and interface coincides with the coastline. The interface profile is a function of the transmissivity-field centroid elevation and the total transmissivity of the freshwater-flow domain above the interface. We found that the boundary potential at the coast in the discharge-potential theory solution represents the first moment of the transmissivity. We also analyzed the differences in the interface profiles in aquifers with different hydraulic-conductivity contrasts for two sets of boundary conditions-constant head and constant flux. For a given-flux boundary, interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts converge in the upper part of the aquifer and diverge at the aquifer bottom, leading to different toe-positions. Conversely, for a given-head boundary, interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts significantly differ in the upper part of the aquifer, while converge at the aquifer bottom resulting in the same toe-position. We provide explicit solutions for the toe-position and freshwater discharge in unconfined aquifers, an extension to our previous work for confined aquifers. Insights from the newly identified parameters can also potentially help in reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the real-world SWI extent and optimize the requirement of the extent of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization.",2020,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,580,,,WOS:000509620900010,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124249,,#20485,Rathore 2020,,

This reduces their ability to provide ecosystem benefits, such as wave attenuation, habitat for migratory birds, and a sink for carbon and nitrogen cycles. A deteriorated back barrier wetland in New Jersey, USA was nourished through thin layer placement (TLP) of dredged sediment in 2016. A field investigation was conducted in 2019 using a cone penetrometer (CPT) to quantify the establishment of soil strength post sediment nourishment compared to adjacent reference sites in conjunction with traditional wetland performance measures. Results show that the nourished area exhibited weaker strengths than the reference sites, suggesting the root system of the vegetation is still establishing. The belowground biomass measurements correlated to the CPT strength measurements, demonstrating that shear strength measured from the cone penetrometer could serve as a surrogate to monitor wetland vegetation trajectories. In addition, heavily trafficked areas underwent compaction from heavy equipment loads, inhibiting the development of vegetation and highlighting how sensitive wetlands are to anthropogenic disturbances. As the need for more expansive wetland restoration projects grow, the CPT can provide rapid high-resolution measurements across large areas supplying government and management agencies with vital establishment trajectories.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,5,,WOS:000664626600038,10.1371/journal.pone.0251420,,#20491,Harris 2021,,

Recently, a 1-D transport model incorporating larval behavior predicted that opposing forces of river discharge and tidal amplitude in the Pee Dee River/Winyah Bay system of South Carolina, USA, could limit dispersal within a single estuary for downstream transport as well as become a dispersal barrier to recruitment of late stage larvae to the freshwater adult habitats of Uca minax (LeConte 1855). We sequenced 394-bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome apoenzyme b for 226 adult U. minax, from four locales along a 49-km stretch of the Pee Dee River/Winyah Bay estuary, above and below the boundary of salt intrusion. Results of an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and an exact test of population differentiation showed a small, but statistically significant (alpha=0.05) population subdivision among adults of the 4 subpopulations, as well as all subpopulations being significantly differentiated (alpha=0.05).

In this context, an optimum management of freshwater resources becomes crucial, but is often impeded by the lack of data. With the aim of investigating the hydrogeological settings of southern San Cristobal Island (Galapagos), we conducted a helicopter-borne, transient electromagnetic survey with the SkyTEM system. It provided unprecedented insights into the 3-D resistivity structure of this extinct basaltic shield. Combined with remote sensing and fieldwork, it allowed the definition of the first hydrogeological conceptual model of the island. Springs are fed by a series of perched aquifers overlying a regional basal aquifer subject to seawater intrusion. Dykes, evidenced by alignments of eruptive cones at the surface, correspond to sharp sub-vertical contrasts in resistivity in the subsurface, and impound groundwater in a summit channel. Combined with geomorphological observations, airborne electromagnetics are shown to be a useful for hydrogeological exploratory studies in complex, poorly known environments.

For the Pearl River, however, long-term variations in the sediment regime, especially in the last decade, remain poorly known. Here we updated knowledge of the temporal trends in the sediment regime of the Pearl River at annual, seasonal and monthly time scales from the 1950s to 2020. Results show that the annual sediment load and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) exhibited drastically decreased, regardless of water discharge. Compared with previous studies, we also found that sediment load and SSC reached a conspicuous peak in the 1980s, and showed a significant decline starting in the 2000s and 1990s, respectively. In the last decade, however, water discharge and sediment load showed slightly increasing trends. At the seasonal scale, the wet-season water discharge displays a decreasing trend, while the dry-season water discharge is increasing. At the monthly scale, the flood seasons in the North and East Rivers typically occur one month earlier than that in the West River due to the different precipitation regimes. Precipitation was responsible for the long-term change of discharge, while human activities (e.g. dam construction and land use change) exerted different effects on the variations in sediment load among different periods. Changes in the sediment regime have exerted substantial influences on downstream channel morphology and saltwater intrusion in the Greater Bay Area.

2290,Observations of Mud-Induced Periodic Stratification in a Hyperturbid Estuary,"Becker, M; Maushake, C; Winter, C","This study presents new observations of fluid mud transport and of the interaction between mud-induced stratification and the flow. Data collected in a hyperturbid estuarine tidal channel reveal details of the intratidal entrainment asymmetry, characterized by quasi-instantaneous entrainment and upstream pumping of mud during flood, and a gradual reduction of layer thickness by shear dispersion during ebb. Rapid restratification early during the flood phase restores the predominant two-layer structure and delimits the transport period, which is then significantly shorter than the overall flood duration. The hydraulic cross section is reduced, causing an increase of the salinity intrusion into the estuary at the end of the flood. The fluid mud layer occupies on average 40% of the water depth, and stratification exceeds that of highly stratified salt wedge estuaries. These data show how mud-induced periodic stratification influences flow structure and sediment transport and thereby contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of hyperturbid estuaries.",2018,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,45,11,5461-5469,WOS:000436249900028,10.1029/2018GL077966,,#20500,Becker 2018,,
2291,Experimental evaluation of irrigation methods for soil desalinization,"Dai, YY; Senge, M; Ito, K; Onishi, T; Yoshiyama, K","Soil salinization has provided a serious threat for global agriculture throughout human history. It is becoming ever more prevalent as human land use intensifies in recent years, and the reclamation is one of major challenges in agroecology. Flood irrigation is a typical method for leaching saline soil. Yet the practice needs a large amount of water, and it is difficult to remove salt uniformly throughout soil layers. In this study, an experiment was conducted to evaluate leaching efficiencies of four different methods, namely: flood irrigation, spray irrigation, paper-covered flood irrigation, and puddling irrigation. Flood irrigation was applied at three plots with different infiltration capacities. Spray irrigation, paper-covered flood irrigation, and puddling irrigation were applied at other three plots with medium infiltration capacities. Results showed that salt removal rates of flood irrigation tended to be higher near the surface of soil with smaller infiltration capacity, and that spray irrigation, paper-covered flood irrigation, and puddling irrigation were more efficient in removing salt than flood irrigation. Paper-covered irrigation was the only leaching method that reduced horizontal heterogeneities in salt content, while flood irrigation and puddling irrigation significantly increased the horizontal heterogeneities. The present study indicated that leaching efficiencies were highly affected by irrigation intensity and also by irrigation water volume only when irrigation intensity was considerably low, and that paper-covered irrigation is an efficient method in removing salt homogeneously from soil profile. Further studies need to be conducted to optimize irrigation intensity and water volume for given soil and water environmental conditions.",2015,,PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT,13,2,159-165,WOS:000351169100002,10.1007/s10333-014-0417-3,,#20501,Dai 2015,,
2293,Impact of climate change on vulnerability of freshwater resources: a case study of Mauritius,"Boojhawon, A; Surroop, D","Freshwater resource availability in SIDS, including Mauritius, is on the verge of becoming a major constraint to socio-economic development. A freshwater vulnerability assessment was undertaken for the period of 2000-2015 to understand the present vulnerability of the water systems in Mauritius and a future vulnerability estimation. Currently, the freshwater sector has been classified as a moderately vulnerable sector with a Freshwater Vulnerability Index (FVI) of 0.36-0.38 derived from a resource availability of 1091-1184 m(3)/capita, a coefficient of rainfall variation of 0.206-0.220, a water exploitation rate of 72-76% and ecological degradation of 30-39% for the period of 2000-2015. For the period of 2020-2050 under a business as usual scenario, the freshwater sector remained in a moderate-vulnerability region whereby the water exploitation rate was found to be the most affected vulnerability parameter with an increase to 95% exploitation by 2050. Under the effects of climate change, the FVI increased to a range of 0.38-0.44 indicating a shift from moderate- to high-vulnerability region and the findings also indicate that the country is likely to enter into a water scarcity region (water availability of < 1000 m(3)/capita) by 2030 and face overexploitation of water resources (water exploitation rate > 100%) by 2040. For all three scenarios, the resource stress category showed the highest contribution on the calculated FVI with a share of contribution of 33-38% to the current FVI, 34-38% to the predicted FVI for a business as usual scenario and 40-43% to the predicted FVI under the effects of climate change.",2021,,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,23,1,195-223,WOS:000505431500001,10.1007/s10668-019-00574-3,,#20507,Boojhawon 2021,,

Hence, hydroperiod (or flood regime), contributes to the regular supply of new water enhancing mangrove survival and growth. The purpose of this investigation was to assess pore-water salinity and hydroperiod variability of basin mangrove distribution by installing three underground PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipes connected to the main tidal channel. All pipes were placed perpendicular to the main channel for an annual cycle. Results indicated hydroperiod enhancement at the location of the underground pipes, compared to control stations. Overall, spring tides and rainy season played a key role in temporal hydroperiod variability. Indeed, the interior structure of the pipes allows rapid and continuous intrusion of new water into the saltpan during flood and ebb currents. After three months, pore-water salinity of 170 in the saltpan area was reduced to 80 at a distance of 2 m from the underground pipes. This study shows the applicability of underground pipes for the efficient removal of hypersaline conditions by enhancing tidal flow for possible recruitment of mangrove propagules in semiarid coastlines.",2018,,CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH,162,,39-47,WOS:000435059600004,10.1016/j.csr.2018.04.008,,#20510,Flores-Verdugo 2018,,
2303,Tidal reversal and flow velocities using temperature and specific conductance in a small wetland creek,"Eaton, TT","Characterizing flow dynamics in very small tidal creeks is complicated and not well suited to methods developed for upland streams or coastal estuaries, due to low flows, bidirectionality and shallow waters. Simple instrumentation enables thermal and salinity signals to be used to observe flow directions and estimate velocities in these settings. Using multiple inexpensive sensors over 500 m along a tidally influenced wetland creek, I demonstrate how advection of temperature and specific conductance pulses reveal flood and ebb tides and the temporary reversal of flow by warmer, estuarine water from the receiving embayment. The sequential rise of temperature upstream was most evident under hot and dry conditions, after daily peak air temperatures of 25 degrees C or above, and was subdued or disrupted under cooler or rainy conditions in summertime. Changes in specific conductance at successive sites upstream were less susceptible to environmental influences and confirm tidal flood velocity of between 0.07 and 0.37 m/s. The tidally-induced flow reversal suggests that periodic high tide conditions can interfere with rapid dispersal of pollution discharges, such as from the combined sewer overflow (CSO) located upstream of the studied creek reach. This low-cost approach of temperature and specific conductance sensing in vegetated coastal wetlands where access, precise elevation control and creek discharge measurements are difficult, provides a simple way of tracking water masses when sufficient contrast exists between water sources.

2307,"ENVIRONMENTAL-EFFECTS OF FLOW REGULATION ON THE LOWER RIVER MURRAY, AUSTRALIA","WALKER, KF; THOMS, MC","Before regulation flows in the lower Murray were highly variable, as for most rivers in semi-arid regions. Major floods promoted large-scale recruitment of flora and fauna in riverine and floodplain communities, and seasonal floods maintained lower levels of recruitment. The regime changed with the construction of 10 low-level weirs in 1922 35, supplemented by the effects of dams in upstream areas. Flows remain variable but are much reduced in volume (about 44%). Low flows (100-300 G1 per month) have decreased five-fold and moderate flows (500-1500 G1 per month) have increased two-fold. Although the magnitude of peak seasonal flows has been diminished, the timing of flows is unaffected. The effects differ in the Valley and Gorge sections of the river, depending on local development of the floodplain and associated wetlands. The weirs have flooded once-temporary wetlands and contributed to problems of salinization. Weir operations cause daily stage fluctuations that diminish downstream, and the channel is developing a stepped gradient as a consequence of active deposition and erosion. Regulation has limited exchanges between the river and its floodplain, changed the nature of the littoral zone and generally created an environment inimical to many native species, notably fish. The key to rehabilitation may be to restore a more natural balance of low and medium flows, but this may be unrealistic given the needs of irrigators and other water users. Despite its evolutionary history of wide spatial and temporal variation, the Murray river floodplain ecosystem evidently cannot accommodate these forms of disturbance.",1993,,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,8,1-2,103-119,WOS:A1993LD19100011,10.1002/rrr.3450080114,,#20526,WALKER 1993,,
2308,CO2-Induced Ocean Warming of the Antarctic Continental Shelf in an Eddying Global Climate Model,"Goddard, PB; Dufour, CO; Yin, JJ; Griffies, SM; Winton, M","Ocean warming near the Antarctic ice shelves has critical implications for future ice sheet mass loss and global sea level rise. A global climate model with an eddying ocean is used to quantify the mechanisms contributing to ocean warming on the Antarctic continental shelf in an idealized 2xCO(2) experiment. The results indicate that relatively large warm anomalies occur both in the upper 100 m and at depths above the shelf floor, which are controlled by different mechanisms. The near-surface ocean warming is primarily a response to enhanced onshore advective heat transport across the shelf break. The deep shelf warming is initiated by onshore intrusions of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), in density classes that access the shelf, as well as the reduction of the vertical mixing of heat. CO2-induced shelf freshening influences both warming mechanisms. The shelf freshening slows vertical mixing by limiting gravitational instabilities and the upward diffusion of heat associated with CDW, resulting in the buildup of heat at depth. Meanwhile, freshening near the shelf break enhances the lateral density gradient of the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and disconnect isopycnals between the shelf and CDW, making cross-ASF heat exchange more difficult. However, at several locations along the ASF, the cross-ASF heat transport is less inhibited and heat can move onshore. Once onshore, lateral and vertical heat advection work to disperse the heat anomalies across the shelf region. Understanding the inhomogeneous Antarctic shelf warming will lead to better projections of future ice sheet mass loss.",2017,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,122,10,8079-8101,WOS:000415893300017,10.1002/2017JC012849,,#20527,Goddard 2017,,

Weakly developed marsh soils have the initial features and structure of the marine sediments combined with the processes of salinization; sulfate reduction; gleyzation; cryogenic mass exchange; as well as the transfer, accumulation, and weak biochemical transformation of the raw organic matter. Soils with different degrees of salinization are formed on tidal marshes and are characterized by some redistribution of salts in the soil profile with weak accumulation of salts in the uppermost organic horizons and in the suprapermafrost layers along with pronounced sulfate reduction.

2310,Response of Stratification Processes to Tidal Current Alteration due to Channel Narrowing,"Zhu, L; He, Q; Shen, J","Stratification in estuaries has received much focus due to its importance in estuarine hydrodynamics and material transport. By utilizing a well-calibrated numerical model, in this work we investigate the changes in stratification in the deepened and narrowed North Passage of the Changjiang Estuary. Before channel narrowing and deepening, lateral straining, generated by the interaction between vertical shear in lateral flow and transverse salinity gradient, is the dominant factor that controls stratification. A two-layer structure of the lateral flow strains the isopycnal transversely, resulting in rapid stratification from late flood to early ebb tide. Thus, maximum stratification occurs during the early ebb. Then, the stratification was suppressed by the vertical mixing and the less stratified water advected from upstream, even the vertical shear in along-channel flow continued to strain the isopycnal. After channel deepening and narrowing, the salinity in the upper water column experienced a sharp vertical gradient during the entire tidal cycle, while the transverse salinity gradient and lateral flow are profoundly reduced. The impact of lateral straining on stratification becomes minor. The enhanced stratification results in a sharp decrease in turbulent mixing within the pycnocline. The water movement in the upper layer is in a free-stream status and the tidal current speed increases significantly. The alteration of the vertical current structure enhances the along-channel tidal straining and stratification is most vigorous on late ebb tide.Plain Language Summary Waterway regulation and dredging have deepened and narrowed the estuaries around the world, altering hydrodynamics, salt intrusion, and sediment transport. Expensive dredging is carried out as these newly built navigation channels suffer heavy siltation. One of the major causes to sediment siltation is the turbulence suppression by stratification. The Changjiang Estuary provides a typical example to study how stratification processes responded to the alterations of tidal currents and density field after construction of a navigation channel. Prior to channel regulation, the water column experiences rapid stratification at the late stage of flood tide as isopycnals are strained by the lateral flow. The maximum stratification occurs during the peak ebb, and is destroyed by vertical mixing from late ebb to early flood. The upper water column of the main channel experienced permanent stratification as active mixing is constrained below the pycnocline after channel deepening. Both lateral flow and transverse salinity gradient decrease as a result of the enhanced stratification. The stratification is most vigorous during late ebb, which is a product of interaction between strong vertical shear in along-channel velocity and longitudinal salinity gradient.",2020,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,125,2,,WOS:000530025600003,10.1029/2019JC015223,,#20529,Zhu 2020,,
2311,Seasonal Variations of Marine Environment and Primary Production in the Taiwan Strait,"Tseng, HC; You, WL; Huang, W; Chung, CC; Tsai, AY; Chen, TY; Lan, KW; Gong, GC","The first data set of seasonal marine environment and euphotic zone integrated primary production (IP) variations in the Taiwan Strait was reported. The measured annual IP was 123 +/- 86 gC m(-2) year(-1) (338 +/- 235 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and its seasonal variations can be described with a left-skewed normal distribution curve. The average seasonal IP values from the highest to the lowest were summer (664 +/- 270 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), autumn (350 +/- 118 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), spring (202 +/- 110 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and winter (137 +/- 68 mgC m(-2) day(-1)). The lowest IP was during the nutrient-rich winter because it had a short insolation duration, low incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and low light transmission (shallow euphotic zone depth) due to strong vertical mixing. In contrast to the winter, the highest IP was during the nutrient-depleted summer, which had a long insolation duration, high incident PAR and high light transmission (deeper euphotic zone depth). In addition, the heterotrophic nutrients from upwelling in the south might also support the highest IP in summer. As three primary water masses exist in the Taiwan Strait and three of them have different characteristics, different mixing ratios of water masses may cause different chemical and hydrographic conditions, which leads to different levels of Chl a concentrations and primary production. It is worth to mention that offshore wind farm (OWF) construction in the Changyun Rise (CYR) of the Taiwan Strait is on-going. As primary production is the foundation for a marine ecosystem and supports the food web and fish stock, the results of this research can not only be used as the baseline for evaluating the OWF impact on the marine ecosystem but also be used for assessing their influence on fishery resources.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000513491700001,10.3389/fmars.2020.00038,,#20530,Tseng 2020,,
2323,Some observations regarding the potential effects of doming of tropical peat deposits on the composition of coal beds,"Cohen, AD; Stack, EM","Several important concepts relative to the origin of coal beds can be gleaned from studies of modern domed and planar peat deposits in tropical-subtropical settings. These are: (1) laterally, some portions of a single continuous peat deposit may be domed and some portions may be planar; (2) domed deposits are most often found to have begun as planar deposits; (3) domed-formed peat facies may be overridden by planar-formed peat facies, due to such factors as sea level rise and/or increased rate of local and basinal subsidence; (4) domed peat facies tend to have less mineral matter and contain fewer inorganic splits than planar facies; (5) sulfur intrusion from marine waters can be retarded by doming, allowing low-sulfur peats to form relatively near to the coastline; (6) marine transgression can cause high-sulfur, marine-influenced, planar, peat facies to override freshwater domed or planar facies, resulting in enrichment of the upper parts of these underlying facies in sulfur and ash; (7) dome-formed peat facies tend to be thicker and more uniform in composition than planar-formed facies, with dome-formed peat facies having the potential to produce the more uniform bright coal types (clarains and vitrains) and planar-formed pear facies often producing duller coal types and/or alternating, durainic (inertinite-rich) and vitrainic (wood-derived) bands; (8) actively developing peat domes in wet settings often exhibit no appreciable increase in inertinitic material toward their tops; although the tops of either domed or planar peat deposits can be enriched in inertinitic material if the water table is lowered by either local or regional changes in hydrology or climate.",1996,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY,29,1-3,39-65,WOS:A1996TP90800003,10.1016/0166-5162(95)00011-9,,#20549,Cohen 1996,,
2324,"Transient, seasonal and interannual variability of the Taiwan Strait current","Wu, CR; Chao, SY; Hsu, C","We have constructed a fine-resolution model with realistic bathymetry to study the spatial and temporal variations of circulation in the Taiwan Strait (TS). The TS model with a resolution of 3 similar to 10 km derives its open boundary conditions from a larger-scale model. The QSCAT/NCEP winds and AVHRR SST provide forcing at the sea surface. Because of the high resolution in model grids and forcing, the model achieves a previously unavailable level of agreement with most observations. On biweekly time scales surface-trapped current reversals often lead to Strait transport reversals if the northeasterly wind bursts in winter are sufficiently strong. On seasonal time scales the northward current is the strongest in summer since both summer monsoon and pressure gradient force are northward. The summer northward current appears to be relatively unimpeded by the Changyun Rise (CYR) and bifurcates slightly near the surface. With the arrival of the northeast monsoon in fall, downwind movement of China Coastal Water (CCW) is blocked by the northward current near 25.5 degrees N and 120 degrees E. In winter, the northward current weakens even more as the northeasterly monsoon strengthens. The CCW moves downwind along the western boundary; the CYR blocks part of the CCW and forces a U-shaped flow pattern in the northern Strait. Past studies have failed to reveal an anticyclonic eddy that develops on the northern flank of CYR in winter. On interannual time scales a weakened northeast monsoon during El Nino reduces advection of the cold CCW from the north and enhances intrusion of warm water from the south, resulting in warming in the TS.",2007,,JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY,63,5,821-833,WOS:000248960800008,10.1007/s10872-007-0070-1,,#20550,Wu 2007,,
2325,Solute transport influenced by unstable flow in beach aquifers,"Shen, CJ; Zhang, CM; Kong, J; Xin, P; Lu, CH; Zhao, ZW; Li, L","Recent studies have shown that, in beach aquifers, tide-induced upper saline plume (USP) may become unstable in the form of moving salt fingers under certain hydrogeological conditions. However, to what extent solute transport in beach aquifers is affected by the unstable flow associated with such salt fingers has not been quantitatively examined, despite the implications inferred by these studies. This study numerically investigated this problem by considering a land-sourced conservative solute plume in a conceptual 2-D beach aquifer. The results demonstrate that unstable flow leads to salt fingers that periodically develop from the USP and then move seaward across the intertidal zone. Compared to the quasi-steady USP case, unstable flow considerably modifies the migration path of land-sourced solute plume towards the sea, moving it deeper into the aquifer until reaching the base. Also, unstable flow increases the residence time of the land-sourced solute plume in the beach aquifer and causes the solute discharge zone to vary over time and shift from the mean shoreline (in the quasi-steady USP case) to the low-tide mark. The temporal variations of total solute efflux pattern are also altered by unstable flow, changing from a unimodal to a bimodal pattern. Sensitivity analysis based on dispersivity, hydraulic conductivity, tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux reveals that the transport path of solute plume is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude, while the residence time and plume spreading are more sensitive to inland freshwater flux.",2019,,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,125,,68-81,WOS:000458695600006,10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.01.009,,#20551,Shen 2019,,
2330,Two-layer hydraulics at the river-ocean interface,"Poggioli, AR; Horner-Devine, AR","Liftoff is the hydraulically forced detachment of buoyant freshwater from the channel bottom or seabed that occurs as river water discharges into the coastal ocean. It is a key feature of strongly stratified systems, occurring well upstream in the channel or seaward of the river mouth under sufficiently strong forcing. We present a two-layer hydraulic solution for the river-ocean interface that considers the river, estuary and near-field river plume as a single interlinked system, extending previous work that considered them separately. This unified approach provides a prediction of the liftoff location and free-surface profile for a wide range of forcing conditions, which are characterized in terms of the freshwater Froude number F-f equivalent to Q/b(0) root g'(0)h(0)(3). Here, Q is the river discharge, b(0) is the channel width, g'(0) equivalent to (Delta rho(0)/rho(2))g is the reduced gravitational acceleration, Delta rho(0) is the density contrast between fresh and ocean water and h(0) is the total water depth at the river mouth. The solution is validated with laboratory experiments using an experimental apparatus consisting of a long, sloping river channel that discharges into a deep, wide saltwater basin. The experiments simulate the full range of hydraulic behaviours predicted by the model, from saltwater intrusion to offshore liftoff. For F-f < 1, liftoff occurs in the estuary channel and our results show that the relationship between intrusion length and F-f depends on the channel slope. For F-f > 1, corresponding to flood conditions in many natural systems, liftoff is forced outside the river mouth and the hydraulic coupling between the channel and shelf becomes more important. For these conditions and for intermediate to steeply sloped shelves, the offshore liftoff distance varies linearly with F-f - 1, a particularly simple scaling given the nonlinearity and relative complexity of the governing equations. The model and experimental results support a conceptual description of the river-ocean interface that relates the liftoff location, free-surface elevation and the spreading rate of the buoyant river plume.",2018,,JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS,856,,633-672,WOS:000446844600001,10.1017/jfm.2018.688,,#20560,Poggioli 2018,,
2336,EFFECTS OF SILL PROCESSES AND TIDAL FORCING ON EXCHANGE IN EASTERN LONG-ISLAND SOUND,"VALLELEVINSON, A; WILSON, RE","Temperature and salinity data from Long Island Sound (LIS) show that the pycnocline rises seaward of Mattituck sill and that the magnitude of the longitudinal density gradient over the area of the sill remains relatively constant throughout the year. This reflects the influence of internal hydraulic processes and vertical mixing on hydrography and volume exchange. Records of moored instruments indicate intratidal and fortnightly variations of water column stratification and current velocity in eastern LIS. During spring tides, thick bottom mixed layers reveal vertically homogeneous temporal changes in temperature, salinity, and sigma-t, which arise from the oscillatory advection of a longitudinal density gradient. Intratidal variations translate into barotropic rectification of the residual flow and vertical homogeneity of low-passed temperature, salinity, and sigma-t. During neap tides the flow may be subject to hydraulic control. Near-surface temperature and sability oscillations of higher amplitude than near-bottom fluctuations are a reflection of vertical excursions of the halocline. The halocline is raised in flood periods and depressed in ebb periods. Intratidal stratification changes reflect the corresponding low-passed temperature, salinity, and sigma-t behavior with depth. Near-bottom residual flow favors salt intrusion as it accelerates down the salinity gradient due to the adjustment of the longitudinal density gradient established on spring tides. The residual density and flow fields reflect a change in dynamical balances from spring periods, dominated by frictional stresses, to neap periods, when inertial and rotation effects increase.",1994,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,99,C6,12667-12681,WOS:A1994NT50400026,10.1029/94JC00721,,#20570,VALLELEVINSON 1994,,
2338,Vegetation communities of western substeppe ilmens of the Volga delta,"Golub, VB; Tchorbadze, NB","A region adjacent to the west of the Volga river delta is known as ""western substeppe ilmens"" (WSI). Ilmens are elongated water bodies appearing during the spring floods and stretching from east to west. The Volga waters used to reach dozens of kilometres deep into the Precaspian desert, but due to various natural and human-induced impacts, many of them have become isolated from the Volga fresh waters which resulted in their drying-up and salinization. The vegetation cover of the western substeppe ilmens is characterized by a great diversity which can be attributed to extreme variations in moisture content and soil salinization levels. Thus, the moisture gradient ranges from aquatic to desert-like habitats, and the salinization gradient from almost non-saline soils to lakes with salt layer instead of water. Some new halophytic communities which were distinguished during the WSI investigations are discussed in the present paper.",1995,,PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,25,4,449-466,WOS:000208428800001,,,#20572,Golub 1995,,
2339,Lateral trapping of sediment in a partially mixed estuary,"Geyer, WR; Signell, RP; Kineke, GC","Numerous observations have shown that the Hudson River estuary has a turbidity maximum zone in the intermediate-salinity portion of the salinity intrusion. The turbidity maximum is skewed toward the west side of the estuary, which is significantly shallower than the east side and is subject to rapid sediment accumulation. Soft, unconsolidated sediment is found along the western margin of the estuary, in contrast to the east side which has a hard bottom of coarse sediment and lower suspended loads. These observations suggest that the sediment transport processes in the Hudson estuary cause erosion of sediment from the east side and deposition on the west side.A three-dimensional, numerical model has been applied to the Hudson estuary to investigate and quantify the sediment trapping mechanisms. The model produces net accumulation on the west side of the estuary, consistent with the observations. Two mechanisms were identified for trapping sediment: 1) lateral convergence due to transverse, baroclinically driven flow during the flood; and 2) a convergence of flow in the north-to-south direction due to the formation of a longitudinal salinity front during the ebb. These convergence processes occur at different places within the estuary, but they both cause accumulation on the shallow, western side of the estuary. Both mechanisms are inherently three-dimensional.",1998,,PHYSICS OF ESTUARIES AND COASTAL SEAS,,,115-124,WOS:000076169500013,,,#20573,Geyer 1998,,

We investigate the importance of different precipitation events using the output of the RACMO2 model. Extreme precipitation events consisting of the largest 10% of daily totals are shown to contribute more than 40% of the total annual precipitation across much of the continent, with some areas receiving in excess of 60% of the total from these events. The greatest contribution of extreme precipitation events to the annual total is in the coastal areas and especially on the ice shelves, with the Amery Ice Shelf receiving 50% of its annual precipitation in less than the 10days of heaviest precipitation. For the continent as a whole, 70% of the variance of the annual precipitation is explained by variability in precipitation from extreme precipitation events, with this figure rising to over 90% in some areas.Plain Language Summary The Antarctic ice sheet is extremely important because of its possible contribution to sea level rise and through the climate records than can be reconstructed using chemical signals locked in the ice. The mass of the ice sheet is constantly changing because of the ice gained by snowfall and the loss of ice at the margins via iceberg calving and melt through contact with relatively warm water masses. The amount of snow falling on the Antarctic is highly variable and dependent on the meteorological conditions over the Southern Ocean and the penetration of marine air into the interior. We show that extreme snowfall events, defined at the heaviest 10% of daily precipitation amounts, contribute a high percentage of the annual snowfall and are the main factor controlling the year-to-year variability of snowfall across the continent. This has implications for the reconstruction of past climate records using data from ice cores and the selection of future ice core drilling sites.",2019,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,46,6,3502-3511,WOS:000464650400053,10.1029/2018GL081517,,#20574,Turner 2019,,
2341,Evaluation of coastal vulnerability and exposure to erosion and submersion risks in Bou Ismail Bay (Algeria) using the coastal risk index (CRI),"Chaib, W; Guerfi, M; Hemdane, Y","The Algerian coastal zone is under high pressure occurring from natural origin (seismic and tsunamis risks, erosion/accretion, salt water intrusion, etc.) and from human sources (pollution, loss of biodiversity, economic value, etc.). The lack of data, particularly time series over natural coastal process, is an impediment for decision making. In many cases, the implemented coastal protection measures even exacerbate the vulnerability of these zones, particularly the hard engineering solutions. The aim of this work is to produce coastal vulnerability and exposure index maps to erosion and marine submersion, by adapting the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) into coastal risk index (CRI) according to the new vision of the risk adopted by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This index turned out to be a relevant tool to adjust coastal planning and management decision making, by confirming the vulnerability of some physiographic units and give at local and regional levels a broad image of coastal zone sensitivity to erosion and submersion. This index should be integrated in Integrated Coastal Zones Management policy and management decision making. The mapping of coastal vulnerability and exposure in Bou Ismail Bay shows that it is 80% moderately vulnerable to erosion and submersion. Also, 45% of the bay is highly exposed to coastal hazards. Some sectors are more vulnerable and exposed than others especially in the East side of the bay. The mapping of coastal risk index using coastal hazard component, combined with vulnerability and exposure maps, has led us to identify the degree of erosion and submersion risk in Bou Ismail Bay. The risk mapping shows that 40% of the bay is at high risk level; it means that some procedures should be made to decrease the level of sensitivity and improve resilience of this heavily populated area.",2020,,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,13,11,,WOS:000536742000001,10.1007/s12517-020-05407-6,,#20577,Chaib 2020,,

2354,Flow convergence and stability at a tidal estuarine front: Acoustic Doppler current observations,"Brubaker, JM; Simpson, JH","Characteristics of the flow field in an estuarine frontal zone have been investigated in a field study in the lower James River estuary. Underway sampling with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) on repeated transects across the front provided information on the structure of the flow field near the front and its evolution in time. As this tidal intrusion front advanced up the estuary during the flooding tide, prominent and consistent features in the velocity field included a localized zone of convergent flow beneath the visible surface line and a stratified shear layer just upriver of the front. Within the shear layer between the buoyant surface water and the faster, higher-salinity undercurrent, gradient Richardson number estimates suggest that the flow was at or near the threshold for sheer instability. Another shear-type gradient in the flow field, the across-front variation of the along-front velocity component, strengthened over a sequence of transects, with intensity increasing toward the surface. Tracking of the front was then interrupted when the identifying line of foam and accumulated material on the surface, previously sharp and well defined, broke up and dispersed to such an extent that the visible signature of the front was lost temporarily. A visible frontal expression later reappeared, and propagation upriver continued. Lower bound estimates of downwelling flow in the frontal zone were determined by continuity considerations.",1999,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,104,C8,18257-18268,WOS:000082043100014,10.1029/1999JC900117,,#20601,Brubaker 1999,,
2358,"A numerical study of coupled estuary-shelf circulation around the Pearl River Estuary during summer: Responses to variable winds, tides and river discharge","Zu, TT; Gan, JP","The mean (sub-tidal) circulations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and over the adjacent shelf are interactive. They are driven by multi-forcing of winds, tides, and the buoyancy of river discharge. Utilizing a validated three-dimensional, high resolution numerical model, we find that the circulation in the PRE during summer is dominated by an advective gravitational two-layer circulation in the upper estuary and the landward part of the lower PRE, where the surface flow pattern also varies with the upwelling winds. The circulation in the seaward part of the lower PRE is governed by both gravitational circulation and geostrophic intrusive current from the shelf. The pattern and intensity of these circulations are largely modulated by variable wind forcing. The cross-shore upwelling shelf circulation off the PRE enhances the water exchange rate between the shelf and the PRE, but the net intrusive transport into the PRE is negatively correlated with the intensity of upwelling-favorable wind stress. Relatively strong water exchange rate between the shelf and estuary occurs during upwelling, which reduces the flushing time of the estuary. Although the ebbing/flooding tide strengthens/weakens the eastward alongshore upwelling current, tidal effect on the upwelling circulation and on the net transport between the shelf and estuary is not significant over the sub-tidal period. The shelf influences the estuary mainly through the intrusions of the shelf waters at the western bank and along the two navigation channels of the PRE; and they are governed by geostrophic cross-shelf upwelling circulation and by gravitational intrusive currents due to pressure gradients, yielded by the alongshore variation of the upwelling shelf circulation and by the buoyancy forcing of the river plume, respectively.

Deltaic aquifers contain coarse-grained paleochannels that preserve a record of former surface river channels as well as fine-grained floodplain deposits. The distribution of these deposits and how they are interconnected control groundwater flow and contaminant transport. In this work, we link depositional environments of deltaic aquifers to stratigraphic (static) and flow and transport (dynamic) connectivity metrics. Numerical models of deltaic stratigraphy were generated using a reduced-complexity numerical model (DeltaRCM) with different input sand fractions (ISF) and rates of sea-level rise (SLR). The groundwater flow and advective transport behavior of these deltas were simulated using MODFLOW and MODPATH. By comparing the static and dynamic metrics calculated from these numerical models, we show that groundwater behavior can be predicted by particular aspects of the subsurface architecture, and that horizontal and vertical connectivity display different characteristics. We also evaluate relationships between connectivity metrics and two environmental controls on delta evolution: ISF and SLR rate. The results show that geologic setting strongly influences both static and dynamic connectivity in different directions. These results provide insights into quantitatively differentiated subsurface hydraulic behavior between deltas formed under different external forcing (ISF and SLR rate) and they are a potential link in using information from delta surface networks and depositional history to predict vulnerability to aquifer contamination.",2021,,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,57,8,,WOS:000688205400005,10.1029/2020WR029281,,#20613,Xu 2021,,

Therefore, this study supplements the studies on soil water and salt transport in the Kongque River region, and provides a new method for the prevention of groundwater salinization in arid and semiarid regions. In this study, soil column experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of lithological structures of the unsaturated zone, water quality, and methods of irrigation on soil water and salt transport. Based on the data from the experiment, a one-dimensional model of soil water and salt transport was built to predict the impact of long-term irrigation on groundwater quality using Hydrus1D. The results showed that groundwater TDS increased in the predicted scenarios and that groundwater quality was greatly influenced by irrigation water with high TDS values. The influence of long-term irrigation on groundwater quality was smallest for drip irrigation, which can save water and should be promoted. The influence of irrigation on groundwater quality was largest for flood irrigation.

2372,Chemical and hydrological controls on salt accumulation in irrigated soils of southwestern U.S,"Ortiz, AC; Jin, LX","Soil salinization is a global problem affecting approximately 10% of agricultural soils, particularly in irrigated aridlands. This study quantified salt-loading by flood irrigation and soil fertilizers/amendments versus atmospheric deposition, studied controls of solute transport and salt buildup, and evaluated the effectiveness of gypsum application in improving soil sodicity in the arid southwestern United States. Study sites include one natural site and two agricultural sites in fields of dominant crops of the region, a pecan orchard and an alfalfa field near El Paso, Texas. The salt-loading rate in agricultural soils was dominated by the quantity and quality of irrigation waters rather than by dust. Salt loadings by irrigation waters were estimated similar to 306 g Na+ m(-2) yr(-1), 129 g Ca2+ m(-2) yr(-1), 361 g Cl- m(-2) yr(-1), 419 g SO42- m(-2) yr(-1), and 284 g HCO3- m(-2) yr(-1), followed by soil amendments. Whereas dust and fertilizer loadings were negligible in agricultural soils. Soil texture variability physically governs water movement and solute transport; coarser soils retained significantly less water than finer soils upon irrigation (p < 0.005) facilitating salt leaching. More salts accumulated around low-permeability layers. Some soils have approached salinity thresholds after only 90 years of cultivation. The Rio Grande river flow is projected to decrease due to reduced snowfall in Colorado, leading to more groundwater of higher salinity, to be used. If ground water were to be the sole water source, the salt loading rate would almost double. Soil amendments temporarily reduce soil sodicity induced by high Na+ concentrations in irrigation water. Their application is needed annually to prevent soil dispersion, to improve infiltration, and to stop even faster salt accumulation.

The measurements show the pathways of a contaminated plume in the unsaturated zone during both the flood and ebb tides. A prescribed amount of dye tracer solution was directly injected through the topsoil, with average porosity 0.3521 +/- 0.01, at predetermined locations of the River Mersey's outer estuarial beach during ebb-tide. The injected dye was monitored, sampled and photographed over several tidal cycles. The distinctive features of the plume (full two dimensional cross-sections), sediments and water-table depth were sampled in-situ, close to the injection point (differing from previous contaminant monitoring tests in aquifers). The advective movement is attributed to tidal impact which is different from contaminant transport in aquifers. The experimental results show that plumes have significantly large spatial variability, diverging upwards and converging downwards, with a conical geometric shape which is different from the usual spherical/elliptical shape reported in literature. The mean vertical motion of the plume reaches three times the top-width within ten tidal cycles, exceeding the narrow bottom-width by a factor of order 2. The observed transport features of the plume within the beach sand have significant relevance to saltwater intrusion, surface water and groundwater quality.

2382,On harbour siltation in the fresh-salt water mixing region,"de Nijs, MAJ; Winterwerp, JC; Pietrzak, JD","In this paper a novel series of field measurements are presented, which are the first to elucidate the processes influencing siltation in Botlek Harbour. Botlek Harbour is situated at the limit of saline water intrusion in the Rotterdam Waterway. Normally, after the ebb tide fresher river waters are found in the Rotterdam Waterway at the location of Botlek Harbour. On the flooding tide, the tip of the salt wedge is advected along the Rotterdam Waterway towards the mouth of Botlek Harbour. Hence on flood, a lock-exchange mechanism operates between Botlek Harbour and the Rotterdam Waterway. On the flood tide, when there is a supply of suspended particulate matter (SPM) associated with the presence of the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) at the mouth of the harbour, the survey data show exchange of SPM into the harbour. This lock-exchange process is found to be the dominant cause for SPM transport into the harbour. This is further substantiated by an analysis of the mass transport mechanisms. In this analysis, the vertical profiles of the instantaneous velocity, salinity and SPM concentration fields, recorded during the surveys, were decomposed into advective and dispersive transport components. The results of this analysis indicate that the correlation between the lock-exchange mechanism on the flood tide with the availability of SPM for exchange and efficient trapping, dominate the total exchange of SPM (97%). Hence, the increase in measured near-bed SPM concentration within the harbour is ascribed to tidal advection of saline water and the ETM along the Rotterdam Waterway. Tidal advection controls the density difference between the estuary and harbour, as well as the availability of SPM for exchange at the entrance to Botlek Harbour. The location of the ETM at the tip of the salt wedge is a key factor in supplying SPM to Botlek Harbour. Consequently the timing of the availability of SPM at the mouth of the harbour needs to be considered in siltation studies. The survey data suggest that Botlek Harbour basin has a 100% trapping efficiency. Analysis of 5 months of data, from a measuring rig located within the harbour, show excursions of the limit of the salt wedge and ETM. These excursions are likely to affect siltation of upstream harbours. Salinity-induced density gradients control the transport and subsequent trapping of SPM in the estuary in close proximity to the harbour entrance, the exchange of SPM between the estuary and harbour, and the trapping of SPM in the harbour basin.

2383,Hydraulically controlled front trapping on a tidal flat,"Mullarney, JC; Henderson, SM","We report observations of baroclinic surface fronts in Skagit Bay. The fronts formed repeatedly in very shallow (<0.7 m deep) water along the edge of a tidal channel shortly after the incoming tide flooded the adjacent tidal flat and eventually departed from channel edge as the flood tide progressed. The fronts were surface convergence zones, trapping GPS drifters and other flotsam. Across-front salinity (temperature) jumps were a few practical salinity units (a few degrees) with freshwater on the channel side. Across-front transects of velocity (from mobile and fixed acoustic Doppler current profilers) and density (from mobile and fixed conductivity-temperature-depth profilers) are presented. Composite Froude numbers indicate that supercritical flow over the flats initially held fronts near the channel edge. As flood tide progressed, depth-averaged flow speeds decreased, while internal wave speeds increased, owing to increasing depths and density gradients. Flow over the flats eventually became subcritical, at which point fronts departed from the channel edge. The front then formed the leading edge of a shallow (around 0.3 m thick) freshwater plume which propagated across the flats against the incoming tidal flow. Water was then exchanged between the channel and flats with a channel edge composite Froude number near 0.5, consistent with mixing-induced reduction in channel-flats exchange. The across-channel velocity shear was correlated with the across-channel wind, consistent with a simple eddy viscosity model. Strong winds prevented plume propagation.",2011,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,116,,,WOS:000290107600001,10.1029/2010JC006520,,#20646,Mullarney 2011,,

The coastal wetlands were subdivided into three areas: San Crisanto swamp in the west, Chabihau lagoon in the center, and Santa Clara swamp in the cast. After the hurricane impact and construction of bridges in the coastal dune, stronger tide's ebb into the Chabihau lagoon was recorded, changing it from a hyperhaline system to an euryhaline one. On the other hand, changes to hyperhaline conditions were observed in Santa Clara swamp during dry and flood seasons. After the hurricane, negative redox values were recorded throughout the entire Chabihau wetlands, in addition to a reduction in dissolved oxygen and pH, during both dry and flood seasons. This situation determined dominance of reductive processes in the three areas, with low temporal variability. If the salinization process continues in the Santa Clara swamp, changes may occur in the structure and composition of the mangrove forest.",2007,,INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES,36,3,183-192,WOS:000250395900002,,,#20657,Batllori 2007,,
2392,NUTRIENT PROCESSING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIDAL CREEK ECOSYSTEMS,"DAME, RF; GARDNER, LR","The North Inlet marsh-estuarine system encompasses the spectrum of interaction between the ocean and the uplands typical of the southeastern United States. The system is an ebb-dominated, bar-built estuary with good flow connection to the sea and some freshwater input.The North Inlet basin has evolved from a forested, relic, beach-ridge terrain under a regime of slowly rising sea level (2 mm year-1). This mode of development is supported by historic tide gage data Pb-210 dating of sediment cores, the presence of spodic soil horizons and tree roots at shallow depths beneath the marsh surface, and the presence of relic 'cat eye' ponds at the edge of the salt marsh. As sea level rises, the boundary between forest and salt marsh recedes upslope and forest spodosols are gradually transformed into marsh soils by salinization, the deposition and mixing of marine mud into the upper horizons of the forest soil and the accumulation of reduced sulfur via sulfate reduction. As a forest watershed is transformed into a salt-marsh basin, the hydraulic geometry of the original, black-water (fresh) stream increases to accommodate the increasing volumes of tidal discharge. Forest sands move seaward while marine muds are transported into the basin.As water moves between the forest and the sea, it passes through creeks in different developmental stages. Large mature creeks interact with the ocean while young, ephemeral creeks drain the uplands and intertidal marsh zones. Intermediate stage creeks connect these two and are characterized by the presence of oyster reefs. Net nutrient fluxes appear to be different in each developmental stage.The 'Bly Creek' study of Dame and coworkers addressed the flux of materials between a creek at the intermediate stage of development and the adjacent mature system. Material fluxes from a freshwater stream draining into Bly Creek from the adjacent uplands were also observed. The role of the salt marsh and the oyster reefs in determining material fluxes was examined. The Bly Creek basin imports particulate nutrients and exports dissolved forms,The 'Outwelling' study of Dame and coworkers at North Inlet focused on the flux of materials between the mature creeks and the Atlantic Ocean. Ail constituents were exported seasonally and annually from the estuary, except total sediments (imported during fall and winter) and chlorophyll a (imported in the summer and fall). The export of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was high compared with other estuarine systems.On a unit area basis, primary productivity is higher and nutrient fluxes are lower in Bly Creek (intermediate stage of development) as compared with the mature North Inlet system. These observations support the general ecosystem development hypothesis that nutrient storage and retention are higher in younger systems than more mature systems where growth is lower and fewer nutrients are needed.",1993,,MARINE CHEMISTRY,43,1-4,175-183,WOS:A1993LX15300013,10.1016/0304-4203(93)90223-B,,#20658,DAME 1993,,
2395,Estimation of seawater retreat timescales in homogeneous and confined coastal aquifers based on dimensional analysis,"Mamalakis, A; Kaleris, V","Reliable estimation of the timescales of seawater retreat (SWR) in coastal aquifers has significant implications for sustainable groundwater management in coastal areas. Due to the complexity of coastal dynamics, analytical estimates of SWR timescales are limited in number, and numerical models are mainly utilized. Although numerical models allow for accurate analysis of the coastal systems, they concern particular aquifer cases, thus their results are not generally applicable. Here, we perform a dimensional analysis for the depth-integrated freshwater/seawater continuity equations and identify the dimensionless parameters that affect SWR in confined, homogeneous and flux-controlled aquifers. Based on numerical simulations, we gain insight into how these parameters affect SWR, and produce type curves which can be used as a simple tool for estimating SWR timescales in idealized coastal systems, independent of the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer. The reliability of our estimates in real-world applications is also discussed.",2019,,HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,64,2,190-209,WOS:000461573900005,10.1080/02626667.2018.1552787,,#20663,Mamalakis 2019,,

By integrating cores, thin sections, X-ray diffraction analysis, trace elements, organic geochemical indexes, and paleontological data, this work studies sedimentary environment elements and sedimentary model of shale in the E(1)f(2) member, Gaoyou Depression, Subei Basin. The shale in the E(1)f(2) member is completely shore lacustrine deposits forming into the hot dry climate of tropical central and south Asia. The lake basin extended continuously, with brackish water, strong reduction, and medium water stratification. The transgression resulted in the rapid rise of water, salinity, reducibility, and water stratification. As the climate becomes wetter, the E(1)f(2) water level, salinity, reduction, and stratification decrease. The shale in E(1)f(2) members is characterized by sedimentary zones, which are divided into muddy water desalination deposit in the flooded zone, clear water salinization deposit in the transition zone, and still water salinization deposited in the clear water zone. Under palaeotopography settings of E(1)f(2) members, combining characteristics of vertical stratification and the plane zone of the lake, an integrated sedimentary model of lacustrine shale in a flat platform has been established under climate and transgression control. The plane area of the lake could be divided into the slow slope zone, sub-depression zone, processes zone, deep slope zone, and deep depression zone, corresponding roughly to the sedimentary zones of the flooded zone, transition zone, and clear water zone.

2399,Biogeochemical effects of seawater restoration to diked salt marshes,"Portnoy, JW; Giblin, AE","We conducted greenhouse microcosm experiments to examine the biogeochemical effects of restoring seawater to historically diked Cape Cod salt marshes. Feat cores from both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes were waterlogged with seawater, and porewater chemistry was subsequently monitored for 21 mo. The addition of seawater to highly organic, seasonally flooded peat caused the death of freshwater wetland plants, 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence, and increased N and P mineralization. Also, sulfides and alkalinity increased 10-fold, suggesting accelerated decomposition by sulfate reduction. Addition of seawater to the low-organic-content acidic peat from the drained marsh increased porewater pH, alkalinity, PO4-P, and Fe(II), which we attribute to the reestablishment of SO4 and Fe(III) mineral reduction. Increased cation exchange contributed to 6-fold increases in dissolved Fe(II) and Al and 60-fold increases in NH4-N within 6 mo of salination.Seawater reintroductions to seasonally flooded diked marshes will cause porewater sulfides to increase, likely reducing the success of revegetation efforts. Sulfide toxicity is of less concern in resalinated drained peats because of the abundance of Fe(II) to precipitate sulfides, and of NH4-N to offset sulfide inhibition of N uptake. Restoration of either seasonally flooded or drained diked marshes could stimulate potentially large nutrient and Fe(II) releases, which could in turn increase primary production and lower oxygen in receiving waters. These findings suggest that tidal restoration be gradual and carefully monitored.",1997,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,7,3,1054-1063,WOS:A1997XQ08100027,,,#20669,Portnoy 1997,,

To remedy this, Managed Aquifer Recharge -MAR-is proved to be a sound and effective technology that is able to fill the gap between groundwater supply and demand. Essential part of this procedure is reliable groundwater modeling that simulates effectively all involved hydrologic processes in order to be able to predict the response of the system under different natural or artificially induced conditions. This paper describes the application of a modeling tool, for the simulation of the relative hydrologic processes between the open filter pipe of the injection well and the surrounding aquifer material with the finite difference method. More specifically, a MAR pilot setup with a horizontal direction injection well was simulated with the Conduit Flow Process (CFP) of MODFLOW-2005 code. To investigate further the applicability of CFP code, the HDDW was conceptualized with the simpler MODFLOW WEL package and the results of the two models were compared. For the two models, sensitivity analysis was conducted using UCODE_2014. Both models were calibrated successfully as the simulated values showed an acceptable fit to the observed data. The main difference between the two packages was observed in the rise of groundwater level along the horizontal well. To this end, it was indicated that CFP offered a more realistic representation of the horizontal well pipe.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,148,,,WOS:000787232400003,10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105289,,#20671,Perdikaki 2022,,

CrAssphage, a virus found in the human gut and shed with fecal matter, is currently gaining popularity as an indicator of human fecal contamination in surface water and groundwater. Here we demonstrate that DNA assays targeting crAssphage genetic fragments can be used to detect pollution from nearshore onsite wastewater treatment systems discharging to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge. We integrated this novel viral monitoring tool into a field study that characterized the physical hydrogeology (hydraulic gradients, hydraulic conductivity, and seepage fluxes) and surface water and groundwater quality at a study site on the north shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. Increased use of onsite wastewater treatment systems during the summer cottage season coincided with widespread detections of crAssphage in submarine groundwater discharge (4/4 samples) and coastal surface waters (3/8 samples). Conversely, classical fecal pollution indicators based on bacterial targets (Escherichia coli and human-specific Bacteroidales genetic marker (HF183)) were sparsely detected in the samples in the coastal environment (2/12 E. coli samples, 0/12 HF183 samples), likely due to greater attenuation ofbacterial contaminants within the subsurface environments. Results from this first application of crAssphage in coastal groundwater contribute to a growing body of research reporting the application of this emerging tracer in various environments impacted by sewage pollution sources.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,4,5,,WOS:000796729000001,10.1088/2515-7620/ac693a,,#20679,Threndyle 2022,,
2411,Evaluation of mulched drip irrigation for cotton in arid Northwest China,"Wang, ZM; Jin, MG; Simunek, J; van Genuchten, MT","Field experiments were conducted in arid Southern Xinjiang, Northwest China, for 3 years to evaluate sustainable irrigation regimes for cotton. The experiments involved mulched drip irrigation during the growing season and flood irrigation afterward. The drip irrigation experiments included control experiments, experiments with deficit irrigation during one crop growth stage, and alternative irrigation schemes in which freshwater was used during one growth stage and relatively saline water in the others. The average cotton yield over 3 years varied between 3,575 and 5,095 kg/ha, and the irrigation water productivity between 0.91 and 1.16 kg/m(3). Crop sensitivities to water stress during the different growth stages ranged from early flowering-belling (most sensitive) > seedling > budding > late flowering-belling (least sensitive), while sensitivities to salt stress ranged from late flowering-belling > budding > seedling > early flowering-belling. Although mulched drip irrigation during the growing season caused an increase in salinity in the root zone, flood irrigation after harvesting leached the accumulated salts to below background levels. Numerical simulations, based on the 3-year experiments and extended by another 20 years, suggest that mulched drip irrigation using alternatively fresh and brackish water during the growing season and flood irrigation with freshwater after harvesting is a sustainable irrigation practice that should not lead to soil salinization.",2014,,IRRIGATION SCIENCE,32,1,15-27,WOS:000329650600002,10.1007/s00271-013-0409-x,,#20690,Wang 2014,,
2412,Diverse water quality responses to extreme climate events: an introduction,"Kaushal, SS; Gold, AJ; Bernal, S; Tank, JL","We synthesize and summarize main findings from a special issue examining the origins, evolution, and resilience of diverse water quality responses to extreme climate events resulting from a Chapman Conference of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Origins refer to sequences of interactive disturbances and antecedent conditions that influence diversification of water quality responses to extreme events. Evolution refers to the amplification, intensification, and persistence of water quality signals across space and time in watersheds. Resilience refers to strategies for managing and minimizing extreme water quality impacts and ecosystem recovery. The contributions of this special issue, taken together, highlight the following: (1) there is diversification in the origins of water quality responses to extreme climate events based on the intensity, duration, and magnitude of the event mediated by previous historical conditions; (2) interactions between climate variability and watershed disturbances (e.g., channelization of river networks, land use change, and deforestation) amplify water quality pulses,' which can manifest as large changes in chemical concentrations and fluxes over relatively short time periods. In the context of the evolution of water quality responses, results highlight: (3) there are high intensity and long-term climate events, which can generate unique sequences in water quality, which have differential impacts on persistence of water quality problems and ecosystem recovery rates; and (4) chemical cocktails' or novel mixtures of elements and compounds are transported and transformed during extreme climate events. The main findings regarding resilience to extreme climate events are that: (5) river restoration strategies for reducing pollution from extreme events can be improved by preserving and restoring floodplains, wetlands, and oxbow ponds, which enhance hydrologic and biogeochemical retention, and lengthen the distribution of hydrologic residence times; and (6) the biogeochemical capacity for stream and river ecosystems to retain and transform pollution from landscapes can become saturated during floods unless watershed pollution sources are reduced. Finally, the unpredictable occurrence of extreme climate events argues for wider deployment of high-frequency, in situ sensors for monitoring, managing, and modeling diverse water quality responses. These sensors can be used to develop robust proxies for chemical cocktails, detect water quality violations following extreme climate events, and effectively trace the trajectory of water quality recovery in response to managing ecosystem resilience.",2018,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,141,3,273-279,WOS:000451259700001,10.1007/s10533-018-0527-x,,#20692,Kaushal 2018,,
2426,"Western Davis Strait, a volcanic transform margin with petroliferous features","Jauer, CD; Oakey, GN; Li, QM","We present a compilation of the western Davis Strait region offshore southeastern Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada with new subsurface geological structural details and observations regarding past hydrocarbon occurrences from scientific and commercial exploration.This consists of seismic mapping with archival data correlated with a filtered marine Bouguer anomaly gravity compilation and magnetic data sets covering northern Saglek Basin, the western part of the Lady Franklin Basin and the Ungava Fault Zone from south of Baffin Bay.A regional seismic horizon for mapping basin architecture comes from the top of the Paleogene volcanic synmagmatic zone, where pervasive volcanic flows and intrusions are intermingled with the sedimentary section. The seismic depth map to the top of the regional volcanic seismic horizon shows pre-rift sedimentary basins having maximum depths of approximately 4-5 km flanking the shallower Ungava Fault Zone. Correlation of Bouguer anomaly gravity and magnetic data interpretations with the seismic mapping, indicate that over some areas true crystalline basement is deeper than can be determined by reflection seismic, as the base of the synmagmatic section is not resolvable for seismic mapping.Extensive Paleogene mafic intrusives and extrusive basalts dominate the architecture of this volcanic rifted margin as seen by the dominant high amplitude magnetic anomalies associated with many deeper structures. The over 250 km long Davis Strait Fault is recognised as the key structural element of the Ungava Fault Zone (UFZ) and valley complex. The adjoining Davis Strait High maps on seismic as a continuous structure running the length of Davis Strait plunging southwards to a Bouguer gravity high feature that terminates the western end of the extinct Eocene spreading zone south of Davis Strait. This horn shaped structural feature establishes the presence of an accommodation zone with multiple faults and localised thrust faulting as required to fit the complex mechanics for strike-slip motion that occurs along the south end of this transform fault system. The revised marine Bouguer anomaly gravity data set also defines two new, near shore grabens east of Cumberland Sound, the southern Tariut Basin and the northern Imaqpik Basin, each extending over 100 km in length with sediment thicknesses of at least 4 km. These pre-rift basins most likely originate from the Paleozoic based on seafloor dredge and nearby shallow drill cores from previous studies. The hydrocarbon charge of a previously unexplained petroliferous shallow marine drill core that is adjacent the eastern edge of the Tariut Basin is attributed to Paleozoic source rocks that have undergone enhanced thermal maturation from sill intrusion associated with lifting. The Imaqpik Basin shows strong evidence of a hydrocarbon system from the proximity of clustered interpreted sea surface oil slicks, mapped from satellite radar images, and a local zone of anomalously high dissolved methane measured within the water column that originates from the seafloor immediately east of Cape Dyer at the northern limit of that basin. The overlying Cape Dyer flood basalt field extends from limited onshore exposures into the offshore and maps with magnetic data over an area of approximately 13,000 km(2). This extrusive feature and it's implicit underlying intrusive components are likely the unconventional heat source for the anomalous enhanced thermal maturation of Paleozoic to Paleogene source rocks in these pre-rift basins that host this previously unrecognised petroleum system.",2019,,MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY,107,,59-80,WOS:000484871100005,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.05.004,,#20718,Jauer 2019,,
2429,"Geochemistry and genesis of hydrothermal Cu Deposits in the Gyeongsang Basin (Andong Area), Korea: A link between porphyry and epithermal systems","So, CS; Choi, SH; Shelton, KL","The Andong Cu area is located within the Cretaceous Gyeongsang Basin along the southeastern margin of the Korean peninsula. Ore mincralization occurred in three stages of quartz and calcite veins. The major ore minerals, pyrite and chalcopyrite, together with pyrrhotite, sphalerite, magnetite, hematite, galena and minor electrum and Pb-Bi and Ag-Sb sulphosalts, occur in fissure-filling quartz veins within Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Radiometric dating indicates that mineralization is Late Cretaceous (91 Ma) age and is probably associated with intrusion of a small granitic stock.Paragenesis of the main ore stage (I) can be divided into three substages: Ia, pyrite (+ chalcopyrite); Ib, chalcopyrite + magnetite; Ic, hematite + sulphosalts. Changes in mineralogy reflect decreases in temperature and fugacity of sulfur with a concomitant increase in fugacity of oxygen. Fluid inclusion data indicare progressive decreases in temperature and salinity within each substage with increasing paragenetic time. During the early portion of stage I, high-temperature (greater than or equal to 320 degrees C), high-salinity fluids (up to approximate to 42 equiv. wt.% NaCl) formed by condensation during decompression of a magmatic vapor phase at pressures approximate to 300 bars. During waning of substage Ia, high-temperature, high-salinity fluids gave way to progressively cooler, more dilute fluids associated with main copper mineralization (substage Ib) and finally to approximate to 200 degrees C and approximate to 1 equiv. wt.% NaCl fluids associated with hematite +/- sulfosalt mineralization (substage Ic). These trends are interpreted to indicate progressive mixing of high-salinity hydrothermal fluids with cooler, more dilute, oxidizing meteoric waters. The delta(34)S values of sulfide minerals decrease systematically with paragenetic time and yield calculated delta(3)4S(H2S) values of 8.9 to 1.5 parts per thousand. These values, together with the observed change from sulfide to sulfide-Fe oxide assemblages indicate progressively more oxidizing conditions, with a corresponding increase of the sulfate/H2S ratio of hydrothermal fluids. There is also a systematic decrease in calculated delta(18)O(water) values with decreasing temperature in the hydrothermal system, from values of < 2.0 parts per thousand for early stage I mineralization toward -5.2 parts per thousand for substage Ic. The delta D values of inclusion waters also decrease with paragenetic time from -62 toward -75 parts per thousand. These trends, coupled with fluid inclusion data, are interpreted to indicate progressive meteoric water inundation of an early magmatic hydrothermal system.Equilibrium thermodynamic interpretation of mineral assemblages and fluid inclusion data indicates that copper precipitation from chloride complexes occurred due to gradual temperature decrease from 350 degrees to 250 degrees C concomitant with mixing with less-evolved, meteoric waters. Later electrum-hematite-bearing ores resulted from oxidation of ore fluids via influx of meteoric waters. Deposits of the Andong area may represent a vein-type system transitional between porphyry-type and epithermal-type.",1997,,NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR MINERALOGIE-ABHANDLUNGEN,171,3,281-307,WOS:A1997XC06600003,,,#20724,So 1997,,
2430,Climate-Resilient Biogeochemical Cover for Waste Containment Systems,"Chetri, JK; Reddy, KR","The waste containment systems which form an important part of the waste management and environmental protection strategies are highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme climatic events and are prone to causing colossal and long-term damage to environment upon failure. For example, the extreme precipitation may reduce the infiltration resistance of landfill cover systems causing seepage of toxic leachate into the subsurface and surrounding environment. Similarly, extreme drought events may lead to drying up of the landfill cover giving rise to formation of cracks and ultimately releases of the harmful landfill gas in undesirable amounts. Hence, there is an urgent need to analyze the vulnerability of the waste containment systems and incorporate resilient designs to adapt to extreme climatic events. Toward this goal, this study presents development of a sustainable cover system for municipal solid waste landfills with primary goal to mitigate methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide from fugitive landfill gas that can also adapt to the impacts of changing climate and extreme weather events such as flooding, erosion, drought, saltwater intrusion, and high temperatures. The proposed cover, also called biogeochemical cover, uses sustainable materials such as biochar-amended soil and steel slag. A comprehensive experimental study evaluated the resilience of the biogeochemical cover system under selected extreme climatic conditions. In particular, the methane oxidation potential and microbial community response were evaluated in detail under widely varying moisture (0%-40% w/w), and temperature (5 degrees C-70 degrees C) conditions. The results demonstrated that the extreme environmental conditions such as high temperature (70 degrees C) and wetting (moisture content >30%) impact the performance of the cover components mainly the biologic component. Nevertheless, the proposed cover components showed satisfactory performance under diverse climatic conditions showing greater resiliency to extreme events. However, the same needs to be further researched in detail under field conditions to verify the resiliency of the proposed cover system.",2021,,GEO-EXTREME 2021: CLIMATIC EXTREMES AND EARTHQUAKE MODELING,329,,189-199,WOS:000774216000019,,,#20726,Chetri 2021,,

2439,Interaction Between Brackish Water Intermittent Infiltration and Cultivated Soil Environment: A Case Study From Arid Piedmont Plain of Northwest China,"Leilei, G; Zaimin, W","Brackish groundwater was widely used in arid areas which may cause soil salinization and groundwater environmental declines. To ensure the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas, brackish water intermittent infiltration experiments were conducted in Southern Xinjiang, Northwest China between June to September 2018, and Hydrus-2D numerical simulation was used to analyze the underground pipe drainage systems. The field experiments were carried out during cotton growth stages after the first freshwater flood infiltration and salt washing. Two control experiments were, respectively, designed as freshwater (0.68 g/L) and brackish water (1.66 g/L) with water amount of 1.0 Q = 572 mm. Other eight groups (1.05-1.40 Q) were compared to analyze the effect of soil salt leaching by increasing the brackish water amount. The results showed that the soil moisture content was almost less than the field capacity of 0.203 at depth of 0-60 cm before each infiltration due to roots water uptake, and the soil water holding capacity rate was lower than 0.2 after 5 days under 1.20-1.40 Q brackish water treatments. Variation of EC1:5 at depth of 0-30 cm was less than 0.5 dS/m. Salt mainly accumulated at the depth of 40-60 cm whether the water amount was excessive or insufficient even under the fresh water infiltration. The optimal brackish water amount was 1.15 Q = 657.8 mm, and the soil total salinity was less than 0.55 dS/m (EC1:5) and reached mild salinization degree. Numerical simulations were used based on the 2018 field experimental results and extended by another 10 years. The soil salt accumulated to 1.10-2.99 dS/m (EC1:5) at the depth of 40-60 cm during 0-30 days. The no salinization area expanded to depth of 40-45 cm after 120 days and reduced during non-infiltration period due to evaporation effect. The soil salt was gradually leached and less than 0.55 dS/m (EC1:5) after 10 years. The optimized leaching-drainage system could not only provide a low salinity soil condition for cotton growth and realize sustainable cultivation but also greatly protect the soil and groundwater environment.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000812086400001,10.3389/feart.2022.894033,,#20739,Leilei 2022,,
2440,INNOVATIVE VIETNAMESE RESEARCH ON MEKONG DELTAIC COASTAL PROCESSES,"Stive, MJF; Phan, LK; Troung, ST; Phan, HM; Dao, HT","Over the last few decades, the Mekong Delta Coast has undergone many physical changes that have increased its vulnerability. Issues that have grown in importance are erosion, human occupation of coastal and estuarine mangroves, decreased sediment supply by the Mekong River and subsidence due to groundwater extraction. These issues have led to the loss of coastal and estuarine land and mangroves, increasing flood vulnerability and salinity intrusion. Recently, young and promising Vietnamese researchers have undertaken a number of in-depth studies to increase our understanding of the above issues. The objective of the present paper is to give a concise description of their work and place it into a broader context. The topics concerned are satellite mapping of coastal landuse changes, numerical simulation of the tide and wave climate and of coastal erosion, coastal and estuarine mangrove squeeze, wave and current damping in mangroves and wave transmission through bamboo fences. The main findings are that (1) coastal landuse has changed significantly over the last decades with the largest change due to conversion of mangroves to aquaculture and a modest change due to coastal erosion, (2) the understanding of the tide and wave climate and of the erosion has increased due to successful numerical modelling, (3) the role of mangrove squeeze along the coast and along the estuaries has been assessed, (4) the understanding of wave and current damping in mangroves and of wave transmission through bamboo fences has increased through the combined effort of laboratory and numerical modelling.",2020,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS, APAC 2019",,,1377-1381,WOS:000554412700186,10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_186,,#20740,Stive 2020,,
2442,Projecting the effects of a warming climate on the hurricane hazard and insured losses: Methodology and case study,"Rosowsky, DV","This paper summarizes research (conducted previously by the author) to incorporate (1) sea-surface temperature projections, (2) event-based hurricane simulation models, and (3) loss models to assess the impacts of the changing climate on the hurricane hazard and estimated insured losses. The focus of the work is on the US east coast and hence the formation and movement of hurricanes over the Atlantic Basin. As an illustrative case, the area around Charleston, South Carolina is considered. Specifically, this paper presents a methodology to prob-abilistically estimate regional hurricane loss considering both hurricane intensity and size as well as projected sea surface temperature change as a function of climate change.It is most common to characterize the hurricane wind hazard using a measure of intensity only. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for storm size when characterizing the hurricane hazard in order to properly estimate/predict the spatial extent of damage. For purposes of regional loss estimation, therefore, considering maximum wind speed only may not be adequate. A storm with larger size but lower intensity might result in more damage and hence greater total loss than a smaller, more intense storm. Here, the maximum wind speed (intensity) and the radius of maximum winds (spatial extent) are selected as the two dominant indicators (parameters) characterizing the hurricane (event) hazard. The resulting bivariate hazard model is then used as input to a regional loss estimation model to illustrate its potential application. Only hurricane wind damage (and associated losses from both wind damage and water intrusion) is considered in this study. Collateral damage due to flood or storm surge is not addressed here.Simulated events impacting this region are extracted from a synthetic hurricane database (developed by the author and his colleagues) and the joint distribution of intensity and size is established to characterize the hurricane hazard. Regional loss for each simulated hurricane event is then estimated using the loss estimation module in HAZUS_MH. Finally, distributions of regional loss at different (event) hazard levels are generated.A future climate scenario (increasing sea surface temperature) is next considered and the joint distribution of hurricane intensity and size and the resulting loss distribution curve is recomputed. The results are then able to be compared to those under the current climate scenario. Such comparisons can help to inform codes and standards committees, for example, as they consider whether and how to take potential climate change impacts (in the design lifetime) into account. They also can inform ongoing public discourse around mitigation and adaptation, whether hardening of buildings and other infrastructure systems, community resilience planning, construction practices, or related policies.",2021,,STRUCTURAL SAFETY,88,,,WOS:000591646000004,10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.102036,,#20742,Rosowsky 2021,,
2444,Salinity control in the absence of a drainage system under semi-arid environments,"Ben Mechlia, N","In many semi-arid regions large irrigation schemes have been developed on fertile plains without provision of drainage networks. The reasons are usually due to a lack of good quality waters and/or high investment costs. Under these environments, characterized by an alternation of wet and dry seasons, adoption of restrictive irrigation practices can help control or, at least, slow down the salinization process of the irrigated lands. Rainfall must have a major role in water supply to the crop and to wash salts below the root zone. Experimental findings show that olive yields planted on loamy sands under 200 mm rainfall are the same (4.3-4.5 T/ha), when irrigation amounts vary between 450-950mm/year. Orange production remains almost unchanged when supply with saline waters increases from 300 to 650 mm/year under 450mm rainfall regime. Sandy soil seems to reach a state of equilibrium after few years of irrigation with saline waters. With loamy soils precipitation higher than 500 mm. seems to be effective in salt leaching. When rainfall is important, strategies based on restrictive supply could be used to control salinity in the dry regions. Practices based on supplemental irrigation (SI) and restricted deficit irrigation (RDI) have the potential to reduce the amount of total salts added to the soil while improving crop productivity. An alternative to large scale irrigation projects, where salinization risks are high, is the construction of small reservoirs to collect runoff waters and the development of small irrigation schemes on sloping areas where occasional flash floods could be diverted to wash out the little amounts of accumulated salts.",2002,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TECHNIQUES TO CONTROL SALINATION FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY,,573,175-181,WOS:000176732300019,10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.573.19,,#20746,BenMechlia 2002,,
2446,"Seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers from semi-arid environments, Case of the alluvial aquifer of Essaouira basin (Morocco)","Ouhamdouch, S; Bahir, M; Ouazar, D","Marine intrusion phenomenon is the main phenomenon threatening the groundwater quality in coastal aquifers around the world. This phenomenon is generally caused by the overexploitation of aquifers, decline in the piezometric level and the rise in sea level under the climate change effect. There are several approaches to study and assess the marine intrusion phenomenon. For this study, the crossing of piezometric, hydrochemical and isotopic approaches was adopted to highlight the state of this phenomenon within the Plio-quaternary aquifer of the Essaouira basin. The couples (Na, Cl), (Ca, Mg), (Br, Cl), (delta H-2, delta O-18), (delta O-18, Cl) were determined for 24 samples capturing the shallow aquifer of the Essaouira basin. The piezometric approach shows that negative piezometric levels are registered. The ionic ratios Br/Cl close to 1.5 and 1.7 parts per thousand, Na/Cl close to 0.86, Mg/Ca and SO4/Cl weak showed that the seawater begins to invade the freshwater of the Plio-quaternary aquifer of Essaouira basin. This intrusion demonstrated by ionic ratios and corroborated by isotopic approach and the combined use of oxygen-18 contents and chlorides has a mixing rate of 15.9% at the well 11/51, 14.5% at the sample 45/51, 13.2% at the well 149/51, 13.3% at point O114 and 12.8% at the well O94.

2449,"Toxicity testing of ""eco-friendly"" de-icing formulations using Chironomus dilutus","Nutile, SA; Solan, ME","An influx of chloride ions from road de-icing solutions can result in toxicological effects to organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments. As such, ""eco-friendly"" de-icing alternatives are sought to mitigate environmental impacts of de-icing impervious surfaces, while maintaining human safety. While many alternative de-icers are economically impractical for municipal use, the residential commercial market is flooded with de-icing formulations claiming to be ""eco-friendly"". Given the little regulation and guidance that surrounds eco-labeling, the meaning of ""eco-friendly"" remains unclear in the context of biological systems. The objective of the current study was to determine the toxicity of three ""eco-friendly"" de-icing formulations to Chironomus dilutus using 10 d toxicity tests. The toxicity of these three formulations was compared to a traditional formulation composed entirely of chloride salts. Two of the ""eco-friendly"" deicers demonstrated LC(50)s of 6.61 and 6.32 g/L, which were similar in toxicity to the traditional sodium chloride formulation with a LC50 6.29 g/L. The comparable toxicities of these formulations is likely due to the presence of chloride salts in each of the ""eco-friendly"" de-icers. The third ""eco-friendly"" formulation, a urea-based de-icer, demonstrated toxicity an order of magnitude higher than that of the traditional formulation with an LC50 of 0.63 g/L. While C dilutus may not have been the intended endpoint in consideration when marketing these products as ""eco-friendly"", consideration of how eco-labeling is utilized and the role of environmental scientists in determining the meaning of such claims must be considered to ensure continued and future protection of the environment.

2450,Particle trapping in stratified estuaries: Consequences of mass conservation,"Jay, DA; Orton, PM; Chisholm, T; Wilson, DJ; Fain, AMV","Estuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) can retain suspended particulate matter (SPM) through advection, settling, aggregation, and nonlinearities in bed processes. We define a parameter space descriptive of ETM water column particle trapping processes through a scaling analysis of the local and integral SPM balances. There are six primary non-dimensional parameters for the large particles or aggregates that are typically trapped in an ETM. Rouse number P, the ratio of settling velocity W-S to the shear velocity U-*, describes the material trapped in the ETM in terms of the local vertical balance between vertical mixing and aggregate settling. Advection number A = P Delta U/U-T scales the landward transport of SPM in terms of flood-ebb velocity difference (Delta U; the internal asymmetry) and maximum tidal current (UT). Supply number S-R = PUR/U-T defines SPM supply and removal (U-R is river flow). Changes in the estuarine inventory of SPM are described in terms of a Trapping Efficiency E, a ratio of peak ETM concentration to fluvial or marine supply concentration. The effects of aggregation and disaggregation in the integral dynamic balance are quantified by a Floc number Theta = Phi/Gamma that describes the balance of aggregation (Phi) and disaggregation (Gamma). The balance between erosion and deposition at the bed is described by the Erosion number Pi = Psi/Omega, the ratio of erosion (Psi) to deposition (Omega). The non-dimensional, integral SPM conservation equation is then used to examine steady and unsteady particle trapping scenarios, including adjustments to a change in river flow and to a neap-spring transition in salinity intrusion and stratification.",2007,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,30,6,1095-1105,WOS:000252891600016,10.1007/BF02841399,,#20756,Jay 2007,,
2451,"Reverse Estuarine Circulation Due to Local and Remote Wind Forcing, Enhanced by the Presence of Along-Coast Estuaries","Giddings, SN; MacCready, P","Estuarine exchange flow governs the interaction between oceans and estuaries and thus plays a large role in their biogeochemical processes. This study investigates the variability in estuarine exchange flow due to offshore oceanic conditions including upwelling/downwelling, and the presence of a river plume offshore (from a neighboring estuary). We address these processes via numerical simulations at the mouth of the Salish Sea, a large estuarine system in the Northeast Pacific. An analysis of the Total Exchange Flow indicates that during the upwelling season, the exchange flow is fairly consistent in magnitude and oriented in a positive (into the estuary at depth and out at the surface) direction. However, during periods of downwelling favorable winds, the exchange flow shows significantly more variability including multiple reversals, consistent with observations, and surface intrusions of the Columbia River plume which originates 250 km to the south. Numerical along-strait momentum budgets show that the exchange flow is forced dominantly by the pressure gradients, particularly the baroclinic. The pressure gradient is modified by Coriolis and sometimes advection, highlighting the importance of geostrophy and local adjustments. In experiments conducted without the offshore river plume, reversals still occur but are weaker, and the baroclinic pressure gradient plays a reduced role. These results suggest that estuaries along strong upwelling coastlines should experience significant modulation in the exchange flow during upwelling versus downwelling conditions. Additionally, they highlight the importance of nearby estuaries impacting one-another, not only in terms of connectivity, but also altering the exchange flow.Plain Language Summary Estuarine systems provide extensive biological and ecological functions as well as contribute to human uses and economies. However, estuaries are susceptible to change and most estuaries have been significantly impacted, threatening their important functionality. Understanding estuarine dynamics is critical to understanding estuarine ecosystems. Hydrodynamic connectivity between estuaries and the coastal ocean is a key dynamical driver impacting critical biological and biogeochemical processes such as ocean/estuarine nutrient and phytoplankton exchange and regulation of estuarine residence time, dissolved oxygen, and acidification levels. Typically estuarine-ocean exchange brings oceanic water into the estuary at depth, mixes it upwards within the estuary, and returns an outflowing mixture of oceanic and riverine water at the surface to the ocean. This manuscript documents seasonal reversals to this typical circulation pattern and the hydrodynamic drivers of the reversals. It highlights the importance of offshore winds and connectivity with neighboring estuaries. Improved understanding of these mechanisms can help us predict how estuaries will respond to a changing climate.",2017,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,122,12,10184-10205,WOS:000422732100051,10.1002/2016JC012479,,#20758,Giddings 2017,,
2452,Natural and anthropogenic effects on microplastic distribution in a hypersaline lagoon,"Quesadas-Rojas, M; Enriquez, C; Valle-Levinson, A","Information on the transport and distribution of microplastics in coastal lagoons is scarce. This study provides the first evaluation of microplastic distribution in a hypersaline coastal lagoon and explores natural and anthropogenic factors that drive their location and transport. The study combines different field strategies: spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments, for September 2017 (wet season and peak use of the lagoon) and February 2018 (winter season, characterized by intense Northerly winds and least use of the lagoon); spatial distribution of microplastics in the water column in the winter season; ocean-lagoon exchanges of water and microplastics at the lagoon entrance during tidal cycles. Also, one-year records of water level variations along the lagoon provide connections between local pressure gradients and water fluxes. Statistical analyses indicate relationships between temporal variations of microplastic concentrations and human activities. Results show marked seasonality in sources and transport agents. During the summer, microplastics concentration was related to human activities. After this season, the accumulated precipitation in the continental karst region leads to an increase in the water level at the head of the lagoon. The resulting pressure gradient promotes seaward flushing of hypersaline water and of microplastics. At tidal (diurnal) time scales, measurements at the mouth of the lagoon revealed that more particles were collected in ebb than in flood. This variability underscores the need to resolve tidal variability for microplastic sampling in coastal lagoons and estuaries.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

2465,"Multiscale streamflow variations of the Pearl River basin and possible implications for the water resource management within the Pearl River Delta, China","Chen, YQD; Zhang, QA; Xu, CY; Lu, XX; Zhang, SR","Long monthly streamflow series of three control hydrological stations of the Pearl River basin were analyzed by using the scanning t-test and the scanning F-test. Possible implications of the changing properties of streamflow variations for the water resource management of the Pearl River Delta are also discussed. The results indicated that: 1) more complicated changes were observed in terms of the second center moment when compared to the first original moment More significant abrupt changes of the second center moment imply more sensitive response of streamflow stability to climate changes and human activities; 2) abrupt behaviors of the first (second) center moment of the streamflow variations tend to be more sensitive to climate changes and/or human activities in the larger river basin when compared to those in the smaller river basin. These phenomena are attributed to buffering functions of more storage space of longer river channel, and more complicated and longer runoff yield and concentration processes in the river basin of larger drainage area; 3) annual minimum streamflow of the Pearl River basin tends to be increasing. This will be helpful for better human mitigation of the salinity intrusion in dry seasons across the Pearl River Delta. Annual maximum streamflow, when compared to annual minimum streamflow, shows larger-magnitude variability reflected by larger standard deviation, implying unfavorable conditions for flood mitigation in the Pearl River Delta. The results of this paper are of scientific and practical merits for water resource management and sound human mitigation to water hazards across the Pearl River Delta, and also are a good case study for similar researches in other river deltas in the world under the changing environment.

2467,Mississippi River delta: an overview,"Coleman, JM; Roberts, HH; Stone, GW","Over the last century, the river-dominated Mississippi delta has received increasing attention from geoscientists, biologists, engineers, and environmental planners because of the importance of the river and its deltaic environments to the economic well-being of the state of Louisiana and the nation. Population growth, subsurface resource extraction, and increased land-water use have placed demands on the delta's natural geologic, biologic, and chemical systems, therefore modifying the time and spatial scales of natural processes within the delta and its lower alluvial valley. As a result, the combined effects of natural and human-induced processes, such as subsidence, eustatic sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and wetland loss, have produced a dynamically changing landscape and socioeconomic framework for this complex delta.Under natural conditions, the fundamental changes that result in land-building and land loss in the Holocene Mississippi River delta plain are rooted in the systematic diversion of water and sediment associated with major shifts in the river's course-the process of delta switching. Research over the last half century has shown that major relocations of the Mississippi's course have resulted in five Holocene delta complexes and a sixth one in an early stage of development as a product of the latest Atchafalaya River diversion. Collectively, these Holocene deltas have produced a delta plain that covers an area of similar to 30,000 km(2) and accounts for 41% of the coastal wetlands in the United States. After a river diversion takes place, the resulting delta evolves through a systematic and semipredictable set of stages generally characterized by: (a) rapid progradation with increasing-to-stable discharge, (b) relative stability during initial stages of waning discharge, (c) abandonment by the river in favor of a higher gradient course to the receiving basin, and (d) marine reworking of a sediment-starved delta as it undergoes progressive submergence by the combined processes of subsidence. Delta switching has taken place every 1000 to 2000 years during Holocene times, and resulting deltas have an average thickness of approximately 35 m. Within a single delta there are subdeltas, bayfills, and crevasse-splays that have higher frequency delta cycles ranging from several hundred years to a few decades. These depositional features are usually less than 10 m thick, and some have produced marshland areas of over 300 km2. The net result of these delta-building events is a low-lying landscape with components that are changing(building and deteriorating) at different rates. Geologically, these depositional cycles produce a thick accumulation of coarsening, upward deltaic deposits that have various thicknesses in response to development on a variety of temporal and spatial scales.In this river-dominated delta system, distributaries can prograde seaward at rates of over 100 m/year. The cumulative effect of the Holocene depository has been to depress the underlying Pleistocene surface. In a local setting, e.g., the modern Balize Lobe, differential loading causes the vertical displacement of underlying clay-rich facies (shale diapirs-mudlumps). The delta front of this lobe, which has prograded into deep water of the outer continental shelf, is characterized by rapid deposition of silt- and clay-rich sediments and slope instability, which results in seaward displacement of sediments by a variety of mass-movement processes.Superimposed on the natural processes and forms of the Mississippi deltaic plain and its associated estuarine environments, are human impacts, most of which have been imposed in this century. The most significant impacts have resulted from a decrease in sediment input to the river from its tributaries and the alteration of the river's natural sediment dispersal processes through the construction of levees. Measures are now being taken to reinstate some of the delta's natural processes, thereby mitigating landless so that decline in animal and plant productivity can be mitigated.",1998,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,14,3,698-716,WOS:000075421100003,,,#20782,Coleman 1998,,
2469,Isotopic and geochemical characteristics of groundwater in the Senegal River delta aquifer: implication of recharge and flow regime,"Diaw, M; Faye, S; Stichler, W; Maloszewski, P","Groundwater and surface water samples were collected to improve understanding of the Senegal River Lower Valley and Delta system, which is prone to salinization. Inorganic ion concentrations and environmental isotopes (O-18, H-2 and H-3) in groundwater, river, lake and precipitation were investigated to gain insight into the functioning of the system with regard to recharge sources and process, groundwater renewability, hydraulic interconnection and geochemical evolution. The geochemical characteristics of the system display mainly cation (Ca2+ and/or Na+) bicarbonated waters, which evolve to chloride water type; this occurs during groundwater flow in the less mineralized part of the aquifer. In contrast, saline intrusion and secondary brines together with halite dissolution are likely to contaminate the groundwater to Na-Cl type. Halite, gypsum and calcite dissolution determine the major ion (Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 (2-) and HCO3 (-)) chemistry, but other processes such as evaporation, salt deposition, ion exchange and reverse exchange reactions also control the groundwater chemistry. Both surface water and groundwater in the system show an evaporation effect, but high evaporated signatures in the groundwater may be due to direct evaporation from the ground, infiltration of evaporated water or enriched rainwater in this region. The stable isotopes also reveal two types of groundwater in this system, which geomorphologically are distributed in the sand dunes (depleted isotopes) and in the flood plain (enriched isotopes). Consideration of the H-3 content reinforces this grouping and suggests two mechanisms of recharge: contribution of enriched surface water in recharging the flood plain groundwater and, in the sand dunes area where water table is at depth between 8 and 13 m, slow recharge process characterized the submodern to mixed water.",2012,,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,66,4,1011-1020,WOS:000304624600002,10.1007/s12665-010-0710-4,,#20784,Diaw 2012,,
2470,Utilization of genes encoding osmoprotectants in transgenic plants for enhanced abiotic stress tolerance,"Khan, MS; Ahmad, D; Khan, MA","Global agriculture in the context of growing and expanding populations is under huge pressure to provide increased food, feed, and fiber. The recent phenomenon of climate change has further added fuel to the fire. It has been practically established now that the global temperature has been on the increase with associated fluctuations in annual rainfall regimes, and the resultant drought and flood events and increasing soil and water salinization. These challenges would be met with the introduction and utilization of new technologies coupled with conventional approaches. In recent years, transgenic technology has been proved very effective in terms of production of improved varieties of crop plants, resistant to biotic stresses. The abiotic stresses such as salt and drought are more complex traits, controlled by many genes. Transgenic plant development for these stresses has utilized many single genes. However, much emphasis has been placed on genes catalyzing the biosynthetic pathways of osmoprotectants. This review focuses on the current status of research on osmoprotectant genes and their role in abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants. (C) 2015 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

Using imported water liberates the modern farmers from one of the major limitations created by this extreme environment, but the high price of the water, along with natural processes such as salinization and soil erosion, can make modem agriculture unprofitable.In the Negev Highlands desert of the Southern Levant, new agriculture enterprises have recently been established on the same soils that were cultivated for 600-700 years by ancient residents who constantly contended with environmental challenges. Therefore, it makes sense to ask whether the modem farmers can improve their methods using the long-term experience embodied in the remnants of the ancient agricultural systems. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining geomorphology, hydrology, archaeology and sociology, we show that the modern farmers face serious problems of soil erosion, soil salination and high price of water. Surprisingly, rain and floods are considered a negative factor for modem desert agriculture.

2478,Land and civilization: An historical perspective,"Juo, ASR; Wilding, LP","The rise and fall of ancient civilized societies can be related to land use or misuse. Fertile soils on the flood plains of major rivers in different parts of the world gave rise to early agrarian societies. The civilizations of Babylon, Egypt, India, and China all grew up alongside major rivers. In Europe, the Greeks and Romans were nourished by crops grown in the shallow, fertile soils derived from limestone in the mild climate of the lands around the Mediterranean. The Aztec, Maya, and Inca societies arose on the rich volcanic soils of the tropical highlands of Latin America. Many later societies also evolved in the fertile valleys of large rivers. They include people who lived alongside the Mekong and Chao Phraya in Southeast Asia; the Danube, the Rhine, the Elbe, the Volga, and the Thames in Europe; and the Mississippi and Missouri in North America. Land degradation was the major cause of the decline and fall of many ancient societies. Deforestation and soil erosion upstream, resulted in floods and siltation that overwhelmed many early agrarian societies. Our modern industrial society is exerting even greater stress upon the world's land resources. Cities continue to expand over fertile farmlands, the impounded waters of dams built for hydroelectric generation and water supplies have flooded valleys with fertile alluvial soils. In many countries, derelict, mined lands and disposal of urban-industrial wastes in landfills have created serious environmental concern. One of the great strengths of modern agriculture is that it can produce large amounts of food and fibre with minimal inputs of human labour,it is however heavily dependent upon fossil fuel inputs. On the negative side, intensification of agriculture in many parts of the world has resulted in salinization of irrigated lands in the drier regions and the loss of forest vegetation in the humid tropics. Humans today are capable of either enhancing or impoverishing the natural resource base of the world much faster than in ancient times. The fundamental question that still remains after 7,000 years of human endeavour is: What is the best way to manage land resources to safeguard the well being of future human generations, and to sustain all forms of life-supporting ecosystems on earth?.",2001,,RESPONSE TO LAND DEGRADATION,,,13-19,WOS:000172551100004,,,#20801,Juo 2001,,
2484,A Unified Hydrogeological Conceptual Model of the Mexico Basin Aquifer after a Century of Groundwater Exploitation,"Palma, A; Rivera, A; Carmona, R","The Mexico City Metropolitan Area, located within the Mexico Basin, is the most important economic center in Mexico. An ever-growing population, currently at 22 million with increasing water demands, has resulted in the overexploitation of groundwater with associated impacts to hydrological conditions for a century. Land subsidence due to chronic groundwater level declines has damaged infrastructure and increased water delivery and flood control challenges, causing loss of aquifer storage. An additional associated problem is groundwater quality deterioration, which reduces potable supplies due to increasing anthropogenic pollution and salinization. A new integrated conceptual model of the Mexico Basin Aquifer has been constructed based on a comprehensive compilation of existing and new hydrogeological knowledge. As a result, this conceptual model updates and improves the understanding of the characteristics of the aquifer and current hydrodynamic behavior of groundwater. Four hydrogeological units were identified, their heads and related flow system interdependencies were evaluated and their hydraulic properties associated; this allowed identifying local, intermediate and regional flow systems, aquifer transition from confined to unconfined conditions, changes to land subsidence and groundwater quality deterioration. This conceptual model could be the basis in building a numerical model, and as a powerful tool to test different management scenarios for decision-making.",2022,,WATER,14,10,,WOS:000801939300001,10.3390/w14101584,,#20812,Palma 2022,,
2487,Optimal Location of Wells for Storage and Recovery of Surplus Desalinated Water in Coastal Aquifers,"Triki, C; Zekri, S; Al-Maktoumi, A; Bazargan-Lari, MR","Storage of water in aquifers using injection wells is an efficient way for utilizing excess desalinated water in arid regions. In this investigation we estimate the benefits of optimally recharging seasonal surplus desalinated water into a strategic coastal aquifer already benefitting from natural recharge of flash-floods water by a recharge dam. Since, usually the buyers of desalinated water commit to purchase surplus desalinated water under take-or-pay contracts, any attempt in utilizing the paid water is beneficial. Coastal cities are observing an increased urbanization leaving limited space for aquifer recharge infrastructure. In order to determine the optimal location of wells and maximize the use of surplus desalinated water available in winter period, a decision tool combining a numerical groundwater flow simulation model (MODFLOW) with an optimization model is developed. The results of this study show that increasing the number of wells from the existing 45 wells to 173 would allow storing 31.4 million cubic meter per year of excess desalinated water into the aquifer that can be used during later during summer months. The net benefit would reach US$55 million/year while the cost of drilling the new wells is US$5.11 million.",2020,,GROUNDWATER,58,5,831-841,WOS:000502797900001,10.1111/gwat.12951,,#20816,Triki 2020,,
2491,"Land Use, Climate, and Water ResourcesGlobal Stages of Interaction","Kaushal, SS; Gold, AJ; Mayer, PM","Land use and climate change can accelerate the depletion of freshwater resources that support humans and ecosystem services on a global scale. Here, we briefly review studies from around the world, and highlight those in this special issue. We identify stages that characterize increasing interaction between land use and climate change. During the first stage, hydrologic modifications and the built environment amplify overland flow via processes associated with runoff-dominated ecosystems (e.g., soil compaction, impervious surface cover, drainage, and channelization). During the second stage, changes in water storage impact the capacity of ecosystems to buffer extremes in water quantity and quality (e.g., either losses in snowpack, wetlands, and groundwater recharge or gains in water and nutrient storage behind dams in reservoirs). During the third stage, extremes in water quantity and quality contribute to losses in ecosystem services and water security (e.g., clean drinking water, flood mitigation, and habitat availability). During the final stage, management and restoration strategies attempt to regain lost ecosystem structure, function, and services but need to adapt to climate change. By anticipating the increasing interaction between land use and climate change, intervention points can be identified, and management strategies can be adjusted to improve outcomes for realistic expectations. Overall, global water security cannot be adequately restored without considering an increasing interaction between land use and climate change across progressive stages and our ever-increasing human domination of the water cycle from degradation to ecosystem restoration.",2017,,WATER,9,10,,WOS:000414707500090,10.3390/w9100815,,#20822,Kaushal 2017,,

This study used remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to assess the risks of soil degradation and the risks of heavy metals in some soils north of the Nile Delta. The study area suffers from salinity, alkalinity, and water logging, so a spatial degradation model was used. Relying on landsat ETM+ images and the digital elevation model (DEM), it was possible to produce a geomorphological map, and it showed that the studied area consists of two landscapes, i.e., flood plain and lacustrine plain. The results indicated that salinization, alkalization, compaction, and water logging were the main types of soil degradation in the studied area. The spatial land degradation model showed that 16.61% of soils were affected by low degrees of degradation, 74.03% were affected by moderate degrees, and 9.36% were affected by high degrees of degradation. The studied area was affected by chemical degradation risks between low and high at 90.62% and 9.37%, respectively, while the physical degradation risks varied between low, moderate, high, and very high with percentages of 9.37%, 41.53%, 40.14%, and 8.93%, respectively. The environmental risks of heavy metals were assessed in the studied area using pollution indices including, the enrichment factor (EF), the pollution load index (PLI), and the potential ecological risk index (PER).",2023,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,13,1,,WOS:000916549200001,10.3390/agriculture13010076,,#20829,Abowaly 2023,,
2496,California Coast Range ophiolite: Composite Middle and Late Jurassic oceanic lithosphere,"Hopson, CA; Mattinson, JM; Pessagno, EA; Luyendyk, BP","The composite California Coast Range ophiolite consists of remnants of Middle Jurassic oceanic lithosphere, a Late Jurassic deep-sea volcanopelagic sediment cover, and Late Jurassic intrusive sheets that invade the ophiolite and volcanopelagic succession. The dismembered Middle Jurassic Coast Range ophiolite remnants (161-168 Ma) were parts of the axial sequence of an oceanic spreading center that consisted of basaltic submarine lava, subvolcanic intrusive sheets, and gabbro, and coeval but off-axis upper lava, dunite-wehrlite mantle transition zone, peridotite restite, and dikes rooted in the mantle transition zone that fed the upper lava. Hydrothermal metamorphism overprints the lavas, subvolcanic sheets, and part of the gabbro. The nearly complete magmatic pseudostratigraphy with minimal syngenetic internal deformation accords with a ""hot"" thermal structure and robust magma budget, indicative of fast spreading.Upper Jurassic volcanopelagic strata composed of tuffaceous radiolarian mudstone and chert (volcanopelagic distal facies) overlie the ophiolite lava disconformably and grade up locally into arc-derived deep-marine volcaniclastics (volcanopelagic proximal facies). An ophiolitic breccia unit at northern Coast Range ophiolite localities caps shallow to deep levels of fault-disrupted Middle Jurassic oceanic crust. The Late Jurassic igneous rocks (ca. 152-144 Ma) are mafic to felsic subvolcanic intrusive sheets that invade the Middle Jurassic ophiolite, its Late Jurassic volcanopelagic cover, and locally the ophiolitic breccia unit. Hydrothermal metamorphism of volcanopelagic beds and underlying ophiolite meta-igneous rocks accompanied the Late Jurassic deep-sea magmatic events.The Middle Jurassic ophiolite formed at a spreading ocean ridge (inferred from its Jurassic plate stratigraphy). Intralava sediment and thin volcanopelagic strata atop the Coast Range ophiolite lava record an 11-16 m.y. progression from an open-ocean setting to the distant submarine apron of an active volcanic arc, i.e., the sediments accumulated upon oceanic lithosphere being drawn progressively closer to a subduction zone in front of an ocean-facing arc. Trace-element signatures of Coast Range ophiolite lavas that purportedly link ocean-crust formation to a suprasubduction-zone setting were influenced also by processes controlled by upper-mantle dynamics, especially the mode and depth of melt extraction. The polygenetic geochemical evidence does not decisively determine tectonic setting.Paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic evidence constrains the paleolatitudes of Coast Range ophiolite magmatism and volcanopelagic sedimentation. Primary remanent magnetism in ophiolite lavas at Point Sal and Llanada Coast Range ophiolite remnants records eruption within a few degrees of the Middle Jurassic paleoequator. The volcanopelagic succession at Coast Range ophiolite remnants consistently shows upward progression from Central Tethyan to Southern Boreal radiolarian assemblages, recording Late Jurassic northward plate motion from the warm-water paleo-equatorial realm. Northward seafloor spreading was interrupted by local Late Jurassic rift propagation through the Middle Jurassic oceanic lithosphere. Coast Range ophiolite crust with volcanopelagic soft-sediment cover that lay in the path of propagating rifts hosted rifting-related magmatic intrusions and hydrothermal metamorphism. The advancing broad deformation zone between propagating and failing rifts left paths of pervasive crustal deformation marked now by fault-disrupted ophiolite covered by depression-filling ophiolitic breccias, found at northern Coast Range ophiolite remnants. Coast Range ophiolite lithosphere that lay outside the propagating and failed rift zones lacks those features. The rift-related magmatism and crustal deformation took place at ephemeral spreading-center offsets along a transform fault.Late Jurassic seafloor spreading carried Middle Jurassic oceanic lithosphere northeastward toward a subduction zone in front of the Middle to Late Jurassic arc that fringed southwestern North America. Termination of oblique subduction during the late Kimmeridgian, replaced by dextral transform faulting, left a Coast Range ophiolite plate segment stranded in front (west) of the trench. The trench was then filled and locally bridged by the arc's submarine sediment apron by the latest Jurassic, allowing coarse volcaniclastic (proximal volcanopelagic) deposits to lap onto earlier, plate-transported tuffaceous radiolarian chert (distal volcanopelagic) deposits. Deep-marine terrigenous muds and sands from southwestern Cordilleran sources then buried the stranded Coast Range ophiolite-volcanopelagic-ophiolitic breccia unit oceanic crust during latest Jurassic northward dextral displacement, which proceeded offshore. Those basal Great Valley Group strata record lower continental-slope and basin-plain marine sedimentation on Jurassic oceanic basement, i.e., the Coast Range ophiolite and adjacent Franciscan oceanic lithosphere (Coast Range serpentinite belt). Forearc basin deposition did not begin until the mid-Early Cretaceous, when the inception of outboard Franciscan subduction lifted and tilted the Coast Range ophiolite-volcanopelagic-ophiolitic breccia unit-basal Great Valley Group succession and Coast Range serpentinite belt to form a basin-bounding forearc ridge. Thereafter, Cretaceous Franciscan subduction and accretionary wedge growth operated in front (west) of the submerged ridge, and Great Valley Group forearc basin terrigenous sediments accumulated behind it.",2008,,"OPHIOLITES, ARCS, AND BATHOLITHS: A TRIBUTE TO CLIFF HOPSON",438,,1-+,WOS:000272078700001,10.1130/2008.2438(01),,#20830,Hopson 2008,,
2499,Bioprospecting of Genes from Microbes for Stress Management in Agricultural Crops,"Shekhar, S; Gambhir, G; Padaria, JC","At present, agricultural systems are under immense pressure to fulfill the increasing demand of food and feed in the context of global climate change with expanding populations. It is an established fact that the global temperature is likely to increase in upcoming decades resulting in the alteration of the edaphic attributes. The change in the edaphic factors due to climatic variations such as annual rainfall, events of drought and flood results in the decrease in soil fertility with water salinization which ultimately results in the reduction of crop yield. Hence in the contemporary era of scientific advancement, it is of central significance to develop mitigation strategies using analytical and forward looking concepts to fulfill the rapidly increasing food demands with ecological sustainability. In recent years, transgenic technology has proven to be very effective in terms of developing stress tolerant crops and use of microbes. This is a relatively simple alternative in terms of cost, unique properties, and ease of handling for broad-spectrum resistance/-tolerance against combination of different stresses. Thus, the emphasis is now shifted to the bioprospecting of microbiota to explore the molecular and biochemical potential of microbes towards stress alleviation in crop plants. This book chapter includes an updated progress in microbial gene prospecting and their contemporary use in different plants to enhance their stress tolerance potential. Moreover, the chapter also emphasizes the different metabolic pathways which were previously targeted towards the development of stress tolerant plants and simultaneously proposed theoretical perspective and a baseline knowledge which could be further harnessed in future research towards sustainable agriculture and ecosystem.",2017,,"AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, VOL 1: MANAGING CROP HEALTH",,,127-147,WOS:000434629000009,10.1007/978-3-319-49724-2_710.1007/978-3-319-49724-2,,#20839,Shekhar 2017,,
2502,Impacts of land reclamation projects on hydrodynamics and morphodynamics in the highly altered North Branch of the Changjiang Estuary,"Zhang, Q; Fan, DD; Feng, T; Tu, JB; Guo, XJ","The estuary is highly dynamic and sensitive to external and internal forcing. We examine a chain reaction of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses to a series of land reclamation projects during the period 1997 to 2017 in the North Branch of the Changjiang Estuary through the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) comparison and the numerical simulation by the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). The results show that tidal amplification was further strengthened by the artificially reduced channel volume in the middle and upper segments of the North Branch due to the implementation of several large-scale land-reclamation projects in the first stage (1997-2007), and the channel siltation in the middle and upper segments was in turn further promoted by the increased tidal flows with flood dominance. In the second stage (2007-2017), tidal amplification was relaxed by the channel narrowing project at the lower segment and the waterway improvement project through channel dredging works at the middle and upper segments. Contemporary erosion volume was almost balanced by the accretion volume in the North Branch because of the weakening dominance of flood over ebb flows. Spatiotemporal variation in channel accretion and erosion patterns in response to estuarine engineering projects was vividly mirrored by the change of simulated bed shear stress in that the areas with increased (decreased) bed shear stress underwent severe erosion (accretion). These findings highlight again the dynamic feature of tide-dominated estuaries and the importance of simulation tools to the estuarine management.",2022,,ANTHROPOCENE COASTS,5,1,,WOS:000864757500001,10.1007/s44218-022-00006-2,,#20849,Zhang 2022,,
2504,Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species,"Rahel, FJ; Olden, JD","Different components of global environmental change are typically studied and managed independently, although there is a growing recognition that multiple drivers often interact in complex and nonadditive ways. We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions.",2008,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,22,3,521-533,WOS:000256612800007,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x,,#20855,Rahel 2008,,
2509,"On the linkages among density, flow, and bathymetry gradients at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay","Valle-Levinson, A; Boicourt, WC; Roman, MR","Linkages among density, flow, and bathymetry gradients were explored at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay with underway measurements of density and flow profiles. Four tidal cycles were sampled along a transect that crossed the bay entrance during cruises in April-May of 1997 and in July of 1997. The April-May cruise coincided with neap tides, while the July cruise occurred during spring tides. The bathymetry of the bay entrance transect featured a broad Chesapeake Channel, 8 km wide and 17 m deep, and a narrow North Channel, 2 km wide and 14 or deep. The two channels were separated by an area with typical depths of 7 m. linkages among flows, bathymetry, and water density were best established over the North Channel during both cruises. Over this channel, greatest convergence rates alternated from the left (looking into the estuary) slope of the channel during ebb to the right slope during flood as a result of the coupling between bathymetry and tidal flow through bottom friction. These convergences were linked to the strongest transverse shears in the along-estuary tidal flow and to the appearance of salinity fronts, most markedly during ebb periods. In the wide channel, the Chesapeake Channel, frontogenesis mechanisms over the northern slope of the channel were similar to those in the North Channel only in July, when buoyancy was relatively weak and tidal forcing was relatively strong. In April-May, when buoyancy was relatively large and tidal forcing was relatively weak, the recurrence of fronts over the same northern slope of the Chesapeake Channel was independent of the tidal phase. The distinct frontogenesis in the Chesapeake Channel during the increased buoyancy period was attributed to a strong pycnocline that insulated the surface tidal flow from the effects of bottom friction, which tends to decrease the strength of the tidal flow over relatively shallow areas.",2003,,ESTUARIES,26,6,1437-1449,WOS:000188745200005,10.1007/BF02803652,,#20864,Valle-Levinson 2003,,

The study site is a small intermountain basin in the Sayan-Tuva Upland, 51 degrees N., 97 degrees E., 1300 m a.s.l. Paleo-archives covering about 13,000 yrs were studied: paleosol-sedimentary sequences on a delta-alluvial fan of a small river, lacustrine sediments in bottom cores and on palsa-islands and soils of palsa-islands. The following sequence of environmental changes was established. The fluvial activity in the basin reached its maximum at the end of the Late Pleistocene. The sharp decrease of the fluvial activity is terminated by two successive paleosols of Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The older paleosol indicates meadow-steppe (or tundra-steppe) conditions with a shallow permafrost table and impeded drainage. The younger paleosol testifies on sharp aridization, biological activity suppression, contrasting water regime, and warming. Dammed lake appeared in the midst of the trough about 11,000 cal yr BP. Sedimentation on delta-alluvial fan was fairly inconsiderable in Holocene. The first part of Holocene (before 4000 cal yr BP) was most balanced in annual distribution of precipitation. Runoff, even being prominently enhanced in a fluvial and relatively warm sub-phase 8000-6250 cal yr BP, was canalized, without giving seasonal floods. Sub-phase 6250-3800 is characterized by increased continentality and relative aridization caused reduction of runoff, lowering of the lake level, and enhancement of cryogenic processes. The next phase 3800-2000 cal yr BP was more humid. It caused slight revival of fluvial processes and rise of lake level. The last 2000 years climate was more continental and the most arid within the studied period. The lake level and runoff values dropped again, and fluvial activity totally decreased. In contemporary soils aridization is reflected in widely spread Natric features and progressive salinization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2525,Current reversals in a large tidal river,"Zhang, FY; Lin, BL; Sun, J","A tidal river is a special zone where the basic hydrodynamic process is the interaction between riverine flow and tides. Existing studies focus mainly on the water level fluctuations, while the effort is limited regarding the flow regime between uni- and bi-directional currents. Along a tidal river, the current direction reverses where the landward flow meets with seaward flow. So far, the occurrence and movement of current reversal is not fully investigated, and the number and location of reversal points are not well understood. In this study, the water flow in the Yangtze tidal river was simulated using a hydrodynamic model, and the phenomenon of current reversals in the tidal river were investigated. It is found that in the dry season up to three reversal points may occur simultaneously, including two convergence points and one divergence point, separating the entire tidal river into two seaward-current reaches and two landward-current reaches. These multiple reversal points result from the co-existence of the preceding and present flood tidal waves. During a spring tide the peak landward flux of the preceding wave can reach up to 10,000 m(3)/s, about the same magnitude as the riverine discharge and the length of the landward-current occupation is as large as 120 km. It was also found that a current reversal point always coexists with a zero-gradient point of water level, and the location of this reversal is downstream of the zero-gradient point. The reversals shift landward from the river mouth consecutively, and could finally disappear farther at the upper reach of the tidal river. The bidirectional flow could extend up to 550 and 200 km upstream from the river mouth in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The current reversals are influenced by the discharge regulation of the Three Gorges Dam. These movements of current reversals in the flow regime could furtherly have significant impact on local hydrodynamic process and material transportation.",2019,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,223,,74-84,WOS:000469152500008,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.017,,#20887,Zhang 2019,,

The analysis outputs of major diurnal and semidiurnal components are sufficiently accurate if the analyzed time-series length is appropriately restricted. Limitations of the simple harmonic analysis in the applicable time-series length arise from tidal-component interference that occurs in analyses over a finite length.
